She informed the Voluntary Liquidator that it is an old case in respect of which she is not in a position to submit any document to support the claim of her husband regarding payment of Rs.4740/-.

I have perused the record placed before me, and considered the submissions advanced. I have also perused the application filed by Mrs. Maria E.T. Marquis addressed to Mr. Anant V.

The Directors of the company had filed a declaration of solvency dated 8th April, 1988 as required under Section 488 of the Companies Act, 1956 in the Office of Registrar of Companies, Goa, Daman & Diu, at Panaji. The Shareholders of the Company vide resolution dated 28th April, 1988 had resolved that the company should be voluntary wound up and Mr. Anant Vasudev Kamat, Chartered Accountant, Panaji was appointed as the Voluntary Liquidator of the Company. M/s. Holiday Hotels (Goa) Private Limited was incorporated as a Private Limited Company, limited by shares on 15th March, 1974 with an authorized capital of Rs.10,00,000/-. The Company had 19 shareholders and four Directors. The last audited balance sheet of the company is available with the Office of Registrar of Companies, as of 25th March, 1988.

That having regard to the fact that nothing objectionable has been found in conducting the proceedings of voluntary winding up of the company by Shri. Anant Vasudev Kamat, Voluntary Liquidator, as such the official liquidator submits for kind consideration of this Hon'ble High Court that the affairs of the company do not appear to have been conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interest of its members or to public interest. . Considering the record placed and the submissions advanced, I am of the opinion that the proceedings are required to be closed by declaring that the company stands dissolved under the provisions of Section 497 of the Companies Act. Further, considering the purport of the provisions of Section 497(6) of the Act and the merits of the matter, I am of the opinion that the company needs to be dissolved. . I, hereby, order that the company M/s. Holiday Hotels (Goa) Private Limited, in liquidation, shall be deemed to be dissolved and is hereby dissolved under Section 497 of the Companies Act. Both the applications stand disposed of.\n\nNARESH H. PATIL, J. ssm."
