State of Punjab\n\n...Appellant versus Bachan Kaur (deceased) through her LRs ....Respondent CORAM: HON BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN ---- Present: Mr. Ram Lal Gupta, Additional Advocate General, Punjab. Ms. Monika Jalota, Advocate, for the respondent. ---- . Whether reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment ? No. . To be referred to the reporters or not ? No. . Whether the judgment should be reported in the digest ? No.\n\n---- K.Kannan, J. (Oral) The appeal is at the instance of the State challenging the award passed by the Additional District Judge, Patiala, against the compensation assessed for acquisition of land for construction of diversion of Railway Crossing for SYL Canal. The notification had been issued on 17.10.1985 under the Land Acquisition Act. The property situate was in Rampur Kaleran, HB No.94, Tehsil Sirhind, District Patiala. The Land Acquisition Collector had assessed the compensation of ` 72,990/- for chahi and nehri lands and in the appeal, the landowners had relied on the award passed by the FAO No.1346 of 1996 (O&M) - 2 - District Judge on 06.09.1990 in Alampur Village. The Government had relied on two transactions of sale Ex.R3 dated 03.03.1983 and R-4 dated 02.06.1983, but the Court chose to rely on the valuation assessed by the District Judge in proceedings relating to compensation in adjoining village. I have not the benefit of information of what the sale deeds recited as consideration, for, I secure no help from either of the parties. I find no error in the approach made by the Additional District Judge by its reference to the award of the District Judge in contemporaneous proceedings relating to determination of compensation in the immediate adjacent village. I maintain the award and dismiss the appeal.\n\n(K.KANNAN) JUDGE .10.2012 sanjeev"
