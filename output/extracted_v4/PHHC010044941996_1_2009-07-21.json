In E.S.I.C. v. C.C. Santhakumar, JT 2006 (10) SC , the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:- 21. It is clear, therefore, that the right of the Corporation to recover these amounts by coercive process is not restricted by any limitation nor could be the Government by recourse to the rule-making power prescribed a period in the teeth of Section 68. . In the above judgment this Court has clearly held that Section 68 of the Act empowers the Corporation to resort to coercive process, to recover the contribution from the employer as if it were an arrear of land revenue and the said right is not restricted by any limitation. This is a crucial Section. . Similarly, no limitation is provided in Chapter VII. It deals with the imposition of penalty or levy of damages upon failure to pay contributions.
