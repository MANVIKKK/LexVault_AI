  "court": "-1- IN THE HIGH COURT FOR THE STATES OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH Date of Decision.03.05.2010 Avtar Singh and others ........Petitioners Versus State of Punjab through the Secretary Government of Education, Punjab, Chandigarh and others ....Respondents Present: None for the petitioners. Mr. Manohar Lall, Addl. A.G., Punjab. CORAM:HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN . Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment ? No . To be referred to the Reporters or not ? No . Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? No -.- K. KANNAN J.(ORAL) . The claim in the writ petition is for counting of ad hoc service for the purpose of ACP scales. The ACP scales were directed to apply for Teachers under the 4th Punjab Pay Commission. The instructions that have been issued have made pointed reference to two decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court namely State of Punjab and others Vs. Harjinder Kaur and others in Civil Appeal No.6525 of 1998 dated 18.05.2001 and the judgment in State of Haryana Vs. Haryana Veterinary & AHTS Association and another AIR 2001 SC , which held that for the purpose of ACP Scales, it shall be only the regularized service that will be counted and ad hoc service will stand excluded. The point raised in the writ petition is squarely answered by the two decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court -2- referred to above and the petitioner, therefore, cannot obtain a favourable consideration in the light of the said decisions. . The writ petition is, therefore, dismissed. (K. KANNAN) JUDGE May 03, 2010 Pankaj*",
