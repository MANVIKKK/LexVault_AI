  "judgment_text": "In the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, at Chandigarh. Date of Decision: 17.12.2008\n\nGurbachan Singh Petitioner Versus State of Punjab and Others Respondents\n\nCORAM: HON BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA. Present: Mr. V. Ramswaroop, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. Satish Bhanot, Senior Deputy Advocate General, Punjab, for respondents No.1 to 3. None for respondent No.4. Mr. Ashwani Prashar, Advocate for respondents No.5 and 6. Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia, J. (Oral)\n\nLearned counsel for the petitioner states that in view of the judgment rendered by Division Bench of this Court in Sarabjeet Singh and Others v. State of Punjab and Others (Civil Writ Petition No. of 2003 decided on 11.5.2006), the present writ petition is not maintainable. Therefore, in view of the ratio of law laid in Sarabjeet Singh's case (supra) that the Co-operative Bank is not amenable to writ jurisdiction, the present writ petition no longer survives. In the present case, the relief sought is against the Kapurthala Central Co-operative Bank Limited which according to the Division Bench judgment rendered in Sarabjeet Singh's case (supra) cannot be issued any direction while exercising writ jurisdiction. Therefore, the present writ petition is dismissed. (Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\nJudge December 17, 2008\n\nDK"
