The present Petition is under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, filed by the petitioner (Assistant teacher) and thereby, has challenged the order and judgment dated 27th October, 1989, passed by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, Mumbai [for short Tribunal ], in Appeal No. GEN/71/SND/3 of , whereby, the Tribunal, had allowed the Appeal but only granted the benefit under Section 11(2)(e) of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 (for short MEPS Act ) and directed to pay six months' salary by way of compensation instead of reinstatement, although the termination order dated 30th March, 1988, of the petitioner was set aside. The Petitioner, being aggrieved, therefore, has basically prayed for reinstatement as permanent Assistant Teacher and all other benefits. . Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. The basic issue which needs to be answered in this Petition is the right of the petitioner, being an open category candidate, to have a status of permanency as Assistant Teacher on a reserved post. . The provisions of the MEPS Act and the Rules made thereunder govern the recruitment and conditions of service of employees in private Schools. The relevant Sections are Sections 4, 5 and 9. The relevant Rules are called the Maharashtra Employees of Private School Rules [for short `MEPS Rules']. The relevant Rules, which covers the case in hand, are Rule 9 and 28. . The petitioner was appointed temporarily in the post of Assistant Teacher for the period 1984-1985 and 1985-1986. Thereafter, he was appointed on probation for a period of two years under Section 9(5) of the MEPS Act. The said appointment order itself contained a clause that his appointment would be subject to the approval of the Education Department of District Sindhudurg. The respondent-Management, however, by an order dated 30th March, 1988, terminated the services of the petitioner. The petitioner, therefore, preferred an Appeal under Section 9 of the MPES Act and Rules. The School Tribunal, after considering the contentions raised, including the written submissions filed by respondents, passed the impugned order and held that the impugned termination notice dated 30th March, 1988, was illegal, invalid and improper. Accordingly, the Appeal was allowed. However, not granted reinstatement with back wages, after recording the statement that 'a suitable substitute from S.T. category is posted'. The respondents were directed to give him six months salary only. . It appears from the record, as well as, the Written Statement filed by the Management that the post in question was reserved for SC/ST candidate. As per the advertisement, the petitioner was appointed for the respective years, subject to the approval from the Education Department, Zilla Parishad, Sindhudurg. The said appointment was purely temporary. As there was no candidate available, belonging to the said reserved category, petitioner was appointed temporarily, on the said post. The said process was continued for two years more. The respondent's case is that as the candidate belonging to the reserved category were not available or did not respond to the advertisement and, therefore, were left with no choice, but to appoint the petitioner on a temporary basis. The foundation of the respondents cannot be overlooked as the post was meant for reserved categories and this post was always subject to the approval from the Education Department. There is no dispute that the petitioner belongs to the open category. The petitioner's entitlement to enjoy the post, in the circumstances, would be subject to the non-availability of reserved category candidate or such other candidate. The fact that he was appointed from time to time from the year 1984 upto 1987-1988, by that itself, nowhere gives any right to such candidate to claim permanency, even after expiry of the alleged probation period, in the facts and circumstances of the case. . In this background and in view of the submission as raised and as referred in the Written Statement, as well as, recorded by the Tribunal in paragraph , I am also of the view that now, at this stage, i.e. after more than 15 years, it is difficult to accept the prayer of reinstatement. The finding given by the Tribunal is also justified to maintain the order to the effect that 'unless the said post becomes de-reserved', a candidate appointed temporarily on such vacancy of ST/SC category would have only status of 'temporary' candidate. . A candidate from the open category cannot claim a right of permanency, on the said reserved post. There is nothing pointed out that such post becomes de-reserved automatically after lapse of time or any other such things. In the circumstances, appellant being open category candidate would have no right to hold the post meant for reserved category candidate. The `quota' or any action based on the Reservation Policy cannot be disturbed without following the due procedure of law. . It needs to be mentioned here that if candidates belonging to the SC/ST category are not available, the petitioner's case may be considered by the Management, if there is still a vacancy and/or the post is still required to be filled in. However, the Management is at liberty to consider this aspect, if a case is made out on merit. . In view of this observation, I decline to interfere with the finding recorded by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, dated 27th October, 1989, hence termination is upheld. . The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of. No order as to costs. Certified copy expedited. [ANOOP V. MOHTA, J.]",

Respondents Mr. Santosh Shetty i/b Mr. M.M. Vashi for the petitioner. Mr. D.B. Sawant for the respondent Nos.1 and 2. CORAM: ANOOP V. MOHTA, J. DATED: 23RD AUGUST, 2004. ORAL JUDGMENT : . The present Petition is under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, filed by the petitioner (Assistant teacher) and thereby, has challenged the order and judgment dated 27th October, 1989, passed by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, Mumbai [for short Tribunal ], in Appeal No. GEN/71/SND/3 of , whereby, the Tribunal, had allowed the Appeal but only granted the benefit under Section 11(2)(e) of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 (for short MEPS Act ) and directed to pay six months' salary by way of compensation instead of reinstatement, although the termination order dated 30th March, 1988, of the petitioner was set aside. The Petitioner, being aggrieved, therefore, has basically prayed for reinstatement as permanent Assistant Teacher and all other benefits. . Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. The basic issue which needs to be answered in this Petition is the right of the petitioner, being an open category candidate, to have a status of permanency as Assistant Teacher on a reserved post. . The provisions of the MEPS Act and the Rules made thereunder govern the recruitment and conditions of service of employees in private Schools. The relevant Sections are Sections 4, 5 and 9. The relevant Rules are called the Maharashtra Employees of Private School Rules [for short `MEPS Rules']. The relevant Rules, which covers the case in hand, are Rule 9 and 28. . The petitioner was appointed temporarily in the post of Assistant Teacher for the period 1984-1985 and 1985-1986. Thereafter, he was appointed on probation for a period of two years under Section 9(5) of the MEPS Act. The said appointment order itself contained a clause that his appointment would be subject to the approval of the Education Department of District Sindhudurg. The respondent-Management, however, by an order dated 30th March, 1988, terminated the services of the petitioner. The petitioner, therefore, preferred an Appeal under Section 9 of the MPES Act and Rules. The School Tribunal, after considering the contentions raised, including the written submissions filed by respondents, passed the impugned order and held that the impugned termination notice dated 30th March, 1988, was illegal, invalid and improper. Accordingly, the Appeal was allowed. However, not granted reinstatement with back wages, after recording the statement that 'a suitable substitute from S.T. category is posted'. The respondents were directed to give him six months salary only. . It appears from the record, as well as, the Written Statement filed by the Management that the post in question was reserved for SC/ST candidate. As per the advertisement, the petitioner was appointed for the respective years, subject to the approval from the Education Department, Zilla Parishad, Sindhudurg. The said appointment was purely temporary. As there was no candidate available, belonging to the said reserved category, petitioner was appointed temporarily, on the said post. The said process was continued for two years more. The respondent's case is that as the candidate belonging to the reserved category were not available or did not respond to the advertisement and, therefore, were left with no choice, but to appoint the petitioner on a temporary basis. The foundation of the respondents cannot be overlooked as the post was meant for reserved categories and this post was always subject to the approval from the Education Department. There is no dispute that the petitioner belongs to the open category. The petitioner's entitlement to enjoy the post, in the circumstances, would be subject to the non-availability of reserved category candidate or such other candidate. The fact that he was appointed from time to time from the year 1984 upto 1987-1988, by that itself, nowhere gives any right to such candidate to claim permanency, even after expiry of the alleged probation period, in the facts and circumstances of the case. . In this background and in view of the submission as raised and as referred in the Written Statement, as well as, recorded by the Tribunal in paragraph , I am also of the view that now, at this stage, i.e. after more than 15 years, it is difficult to accept the prayer of reinstatement.

Order dated 29.1.2003 reads as under:- \"The learned Counsel appearing for plaintiff /decree holder states that there is no order passed in execution of the decree, according to which, the Receiver can take possession of the property to which the decree relates. The statement is accepted. In view of this statement, the Receiver's report is disposed of.\" According to the Receiver's report there is an order made by the Court directing the Receiver to take possession of the property. Even assuming that the statement made by the Receiver in the report is correct, the Receiver is appointed in execution of a decree for benefit of the decree holder. When the Receiver takes possession in execution of the decree obviously it is for the benefit of the decree holder. But when the decree holder himself says that the Receiver is not entitled to take possession then, in my opinion, the inquiry should end. The learned Counsel appearing for decree holder even today says that there is no order authorising the Receiver to take possession of the property in relation to which the decree is passed. He has made the same statement before the Court on 29.1.2003 also, which has been recorded by the Court. In this view of the matter, there is no point in Receiver maintaining possession because the Receiver is maintaining possession obviously for the benefit of the decree holder.

In the present case it is an admitted position that the recovery proceedings are pending before the D.R.T. The said recovery proceedings are instituted by various banks and financial institutions. In view of the pendency of the said recovery proceedings which is initiated by the secured creditors, it is not possible to sanction the sale of the properties at the instance of Official Liquidator in the present winding-up proceedings. In my view the properties which are the :2: :2: :2: subject of security of the banks and financial institutions will have to be sold and disposed of by the recovery officer in pursuance of the recovery certificate issued by the D.R.T. under the provisions of The Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. In view thereof I reject the present report made by the Official Liquidator. However, I direct the Official Liquidator to hold the properties subject to the orders passed by the D.R.T. in the said recovery proceedings which are pending before it. It is made clear that the Official Liquidator will hand over the possession of the premise as per the direction of the D.R.T. subject to recovery of necessary security charges and other expenses incurred by the Official Liquidator for protecting the said property. 2. Mr. Madon, learned counsel appearing for the Central Bank of India however states that security charges up to date has been paid and he further states that few security charges are also paid as per the direction contained in this order. The Official Liquidator admits that up to date the security charges are already received by him from the secured creditors. 3. In the aforesaid view of the matter no orders are necessary on the report of the Official Liquidator dated 1.8.2003. The report is disposed of accordingly. :3: :3: :3: No order as to costs.

In paragraph six of this order the learned Single Judge observed thus : A perusal of the report of the Official Liquidator dated 19th April, would ex facie demonstrate that the Liquidator has not dealt with the claim of the Customs Authorities to priority. The report considers only the question of apportionment. In fact in paragraphs 15 and 16 of the affidavit filed by the Customs Department before the Official\n\nLiquidator, a claim of priority has been raised. Though there was inadvertance on the part of the Customs Authorities in not pointing out the subsequent directions of the Division Bench dated 19th December, and 9th January, 2004 when an order was passed by the Court on 22nd March, 2007, it is necessary and proper that in compliance with the directions of the Division Bench, the question of priority is considered afresh. In order to facilitate this parties shall appear before the Official Liquidator on 3rd May, 2007 through authorised representatives and/or Advocates at .00 a.m. when the Customs Authorities shall be at liberty to place all their submissions in regard to the claim of priority and apportionment. The Warehousing Corporations would also be at\n\nliberty to place their submissions on the record. The Liquidator shall after considering the rival submissions place a further report after adjudicating upon the claim, including the question of priority. . Learned counsel appearing for the Central Warehousing Corporation and the Customs Department submitted that directions sought in the Report cannot be granted. They submitted that in view of the aforesaid directions given by the learned Single Judge vide order dated 21st April, 2007, the Official Liquidator ought to have made the legal opinion given by M/s.Billawala & Co available to the Central Warehousing Corporation & the Customs Department and conducted a fresh hearing and only after adjudicating upon the claim he should filed Report before this Court. Upon perusal of the directions given by this Court in the order dated st April, 2007 and the prayer clause (a) in the Report I find substance in the submissions advanced by learned counsel. After obtaining the legal opinion, admittedly no hearing was conducted by the Official Liquidator. In the circumstances, I am satisfied this Report can be disposed of by the following directions : (a) The legal opinion given by M/s.Billawala & Co. be made available to the learned counsel appearing for the Central Warehousing Corporation and the Customs Department. The Official Liquidator to fix a date of hearing afresh and after considering the rival submissions place fresh report after adjudicating upon the claim, including a question of priority. (b) With these directions, the Official Liquidator's Report stands disposed of. It is needless to express that the Official Liquidator shall give written intimation to the advocates appearing on behalf of the Central Warehousing Corporation, the Maharashtra State Warehousing Corporation and the Customs Department well in advance.

He has further proposed that dividend at the rate of 60 paise in a rupee be declared to the ordinary creditors amounting to Rs.75,71,525/-. The report also seeks permission to open a \"Separate Dividend Account\" with the Punjab National Bank, P.N.B. House, Fort Branch, Mumbai with a further direction to pay dividend from 21st November 2005 to 20th May 1996 and the balance amount which remains unpaid/unclaimed to be transferred to the \"Company s Liquidation Account\". : 2 : 2. The learned Advocate appearing for the Bank of Maharashtra and United Western Bank submits that even after paying 75,71,525/- as proposed by the Official Liquidator, a substantial amount would lie to the credit of the Company in liquidation. He, therefore, submits that dividend at the rate of 80% be declared for the ordinary creditors rather than 60% as proposed by the Official Liquidator. 3. In my view, this submission of the learned Advocate can be accepted as sufficient funds would be available to the Official Liquidator even after payment of dividend at 80%. 4. Hence, the following directions are issued : (a) The Official Liquidator to declare a dividend at the rate of 100 paise in a rupee for the Preferential Creditors amounting to Rs.26,16,908/-. (b) The Official Liquidator shall declare dividend at the rate of 80 paise in a rupee for all ordinary creditors.

Payment for the said advertisement be made from the funds lying to the credit of the Company (in liquidation). (d) Official Liquidator to open a \"Separate Dividend Account\" with Punjab National Bank, P.N.B. House, Fort Branch, Mumbai. The dividend shall be payable from 21st November 2005 to 20th May 2006. The unpaid/unclaimed amount, if any, from 21st May shall be transferred to the \"Company s Liquidation Account\" maintained with the Registrar of Companies, Maharashtra, Mumbai. 5.

CORAM : K.R. SHRIRAM, J. DATED : 7TH OCTOBER, 2016. P.C. The Suit came to be settled by consent of the parties on 8th October 1985. Consent terms were drawn. A consent decree in terms of the consent terms is passed. The consent decree states that it is to operate as a conveyance in favour of the Plaintiff. The Consent Decree becomes a conveyance as defined under Section 2(g) (iii) of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958, which runs thus : S.2(g) Conveyance includes, (i) (ii) (iii) Every decree or final order of any Civil Court. (iv) By which property, whether movable or immovable, or any estate or interest in any property is transferred to, or vested in, any other person, inter vivos, and which is not otherwise specifically provided for by Schedule I . Waghmare 1/3 .s.2459.1985.doc Hence a consent decree passed pursuant to Consent Terms operates as a decree of the court. The said definition came into force on 10th December , pursuant to the substitution of the definition for the previous definition by the Amendment Act of 1985. Upon the consent terms operating as a decree of the court and being termed a conveyance in favour of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff derived title to the suit property. The Plaintiff as the owner of the suit property, acquired all the rights of ownership. The utilization and enjoyment of those rights require the original document of conveyance to be in the possession of the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff to be able to use the document to show his title. This becomes essential more specially when the Plaintiff is required to transfer his title either by way of mortgage, sale, lease, etc, when the original document of title would be required to be handed over to the transferee. The Plaintiff has got the consent decree operating as conveyance registered and stamped in accordance with Law. The Plaintiff is required to be returned the original document of title. Waghmare 2/3 .s.2459.1985.doc All original documents produced by parties are, as a matter of practice returned to them after the final judgment is pronounced and the suit is disposed of. There is, therefore, no reason not to return the original document of title to the Plaintiff. Further, this issue has been dealt with by a decision of this Court in K. Raheja Corporation Private Limited Vs Mrs Goolestan Peter Coelho and Others, where it was directed that a consent decree be handed over to the Plaintiff in that case. I also find support of an order dated 23.12.2015 passed in Suit No.2225 of 1993. In a matter such as this, therefore, the Plaintiff would be entitled to the return of the original consent decree. The office of the Prothonotary and Senior Master shall make a certified copy of the consent decree filed in the suit and operating as a conveyance to be kept on record of this suit and return the original decree to the Plaintiff within four weeks.

This Court is informed that Miscellaneous Petition No.243 of 2022 is also filed before this Court, seeking revocation of the said petition. . It would be in the interest of justice that both the petitions are taken up for consideration together. . This Court is informed that respondent No.1, who was one of the two executors, has, in the meanwhile, expired, during the pendency of the /2 _MPTL_144_24.doc petitions. The other executor is respondent No.2 in these petitions and hence, the name of respondent No.1 can be deleted from the array of respondents in both the petitions. . In fact, in Miscellaneous Petition No.243 of 2022, Interim Application (Lodging) No. 12643 of 2024 appears to have been filed for bringing on record legal heirs of the deceased executor (respondent No.1). In that light, Miscellaneous Petition No.243 of 2022 alongwith the said pending application, is taken on board. . Considering the fact that respondent No.1 was one of the executors concerning the subject Will, upon his demise, there is no question of bringing his legal heirs on record, particularly when the other executor is before this Court as respondent No.2. In that light, respondent No.1 in both the petitions, stands deleted. . Hence, Interim Application (Lodging) No. 12643 of 2024 filed in Miscellaneous Petition No.243 of 2022 is disposed of. . Reply affidavits in both the miscellaneous petitions be filed within three weeks from today. Rejoinder affidavit, if any, be filed within two weeks thereafter. .

One of the reasons given in the report is that there are no assets and no amount lying to the credit of the company. However, in the report it is also mentioned that the Ex-Directors have not responded for filing of statement of affairs of the company and it is stated, in the circumstances, that no Borey 1/2 spb/ 19cp171-89olr462-13.sxw useful purpose would be served by keeping the company under liquidation. If the Ex-Directors have not filed the statement of affairs, the official liquidator will not come to know whether there are any assets of the company. Therefore, the fact that the Ex- Directors have not co-operated with the official liquidator cannot be a reason for dissolution of the company. On the other hand, it is a case for proceeding against the Ex-Directors for not filing the returns. The official liquidator will accordingly instead of pressing this report, should file a report, seeking action against the Ex-Directors. It is made clear that the official liquidator will keep in mind the above observations and, before proposing dissolution of the company, shall ensure that all information has been supplied by the Ex-Directors and all efforts are made by the official liquidator to find out assets of the company and it is only when absolutely no further progress is possible in spite of the co-operation from all concerned, the dissolution needs to be proposed.

The Laxmi Bank Limited has filed this petition with following prayers. (a) That the company be ordered to be would up by this Honourable Court under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956; (b) The Official Liquidator or some other fit and proper person be appointed as the Official Liquidator with all powers under the . . The Laxmi Bank Ltd. has averred that the company by name, Gopaldas Mohatta & Company Limited was incorporated at Nagpur on 25.05.1941. The name of the company was later on changed to Navbharat Trading Company Private Limited (company under liquidation), in the meeting of shareholders dated 28.07.1947. The authorized capital of the company was Rs.10,00,000/- and the subscribed and issued capital was Rs.1,61,200/-. The company had multiple objects including trading, financing, etc. It appears that the company had issued three cheques to Laxmi Investment Company Pvt. Ltd., total amounting to Rs.1,35,000/-. It further appears that Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. had a current account with the petitioner bank at Bombay, Fort Branch. The aforesaid three cheques were presented by Laxmi Investment Company Ltd., which were returned with remark, Refer to drawer . According to the petitioner, the Company did not have sufficient funds in its :BHC-NAG:3212 (2) cmp 8.1961 account with the said branch. The petitioner bank, however, paid the amount of the aforesaid three cheques drawn on company s account with an assumption that the amount of cheques deposited by the company in its account would be met. According to the petitioner, the amount, that was payable by the company under liquidation was to the tune of Rs.1,14,000/- and accordingly on 18.07.1961, the liquidator of the petitioner company addressed a notice of payment to Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd., calling upon the company to pay the sum of Rs.1,14,000/-. The envelope containing notice was, however, not accepted by the company under liquidation. . I am informed that not only the company under liquidation i.e. Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. but also the other company, Laxmi Investment Company Pvt. Ltd. and Laxmi Bank are under liquidation. In addition, a company namely, National Commercial Corporation Ltd. was also under liquidation in Company Petition No.9/1961, which came to be dissolved by this Court vide order dated 09.06.2022. . Thus, what remains is the three other companies which are subject matter of Company Petition No.8/1961 (present petition) in respect of Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd., Company Petition No.12/1961 in respect of Laxmi Investment Co. Ltd. and Company Petition No.14/1960 in respect of Laxmi Bank Ltd., the proceeding being initiated by the Reserve Bank of India. The winding up proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. have been initiated by Laxmi Bank. . Thus, it appears that Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. were holding accounts with Laxmi Bank. It further appears that some financial benefits were extended by Laxmi Bank to Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd and accordingly Laxmi Bank proceeded to file liquidation proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. however, prior thereto Laxmi Bank itself was subject matter of winding up proceeding at the instance of the Reserve Bank of India. That appears to be the reason why Liquidator of Laxmi Bank has filed the proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company Pvt. Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. (3) cmp 8.1961 . Coming back to the present proceeding, the Official Liquidator submits that as on 31.12.2024, Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. has no assets except one fixed deposit of Rs.1,48,117/-. The Official Liquidator submits that there are two creditors. One is Laxmi Bank, for Rs.3,60,000/- another is Sales Tax Department, Akola for Rs.36,357/-. Mr. Deshpande, learned counsel for the Official Liquidator, submits that the claim of Laxmi Bank will have to be processed first, in terms of Section 529 of the Companies Act, 1956 and since the amount lying to the credit of the company is not sufficient to pay the entire amount of Laxmi Bank, the Company under liquidation is not in a position to pay dues to the Sales Tax Department, Akola. . The Official Liquidator, however, seeks further time to verify whether there are any other assets belonging to Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. Stand over to 28.03.2025. As could be seen, Laxmi Bank Limited has initiated the present petition. The amount due and payable to Laxmi Bank Limited is/was Rs. 1,14,000/-. . The Official Liquidator submits that there are no assets of Navbharat Trading Company Private Limited. He submits that the amount of Rs. 1,48,117/- is, however, lying to the credit of company and accordingly, seeks permission to pay the amount to Laxmi Bank Limited after adjusting amount towards administrative and other expenses. Permission granted. The amount be paid within two weeks from today. . The Official Liquidator shall pay to Laxmi Bank Limited the amount which is lying to its credit after meeting administrative and other expenses. . The Official Liquidator submits that upon doing aforesaid exercise, nothing would remain with Navbharat Trading Company Private Limited to continue with liquidation proceedings and hence (4) cmp 8.1961 request is made to dissolve the company under Section 481 of the Companies Act, 1956. . Thus, it appears that the Official Liquidator cannot proceed with the winding up of the company for want of fund and asset. It is thus just and reasonable to order dissolution of the company in terms of Section 481 of the Companies Act. Hence, following order is passed. ORDER (i) Company named Navbharat Trading Company Private Limited stands dissolved in terms of Section 481(1) of the Companies Act, 1956 subject to compliance of direction in paragraph no. 2 of the order. (ii) The Official Liquidator shall forward copy of order to the Registrar of Companies in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 481 of the Companies Act. (iii) The Official Liquidator shall file report of payment of dues to the Registrar(Judicial) of this Court within two weeks from today. (iv) The company petition is disposed of in above terms.

The Official Liquidator submits that upon doing aforesaid exercise, nothing would remain with Navbharat Trading Company Private Limited to continue with liquidation proceedings and hence (4) cmp 8.1961 request is made to dissolve the company under Section 481 of the Companies Act, 1956. . Thus, it appears that the Official Liquidator cannot proceed with the winding up of the company for want of fund and asset. It is thus just and reasonable to order dissolution of the company in terms of Section 481 of the Companies Act. Hence, following order is passed. ORDER (i) Company named Navbharat Trading Company Private Limited stands dissolved in terms of Section 481(1) of the Companies Act, 1956 subject to compliance of direction in paragraph no. 2 of the order. (ii) The Official Liquidator shall forward copy of order to the Registrar of Companies in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 481 of the Companies Act. (iii) The Official Liquidator shall file report of payment of dues to the Registrar(Judicial) of this Court within two weeks from today. (iv) The company petition is disposed of in above terms.

    "summary": "According to the petitioner, the amount, that was payable by the company under liquidation was to the tune of Rs.1,14,000/- and accordingly on 18.07.1961, the liquidator of the petitioner company addressed a notice of payment to Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Thus, it appears that Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd and accordingly Laxmi Bank proceeded to file liquidation proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Mr. Deshpande, learned counsel for the Official Liquidator, submits that the claim of Laxmi Bank will have to be processed first, in terms of Section 529 of the Companies Act, 1956 and since the amount lying to the credit of the company is not sufficient to pay the entire amount of Laxmi Bank, the Company under liquidation is not in a position to pay dues to the Sales Tax Department, Akola."

Shridhar, Official Liquidator. CORAM :- NARESH H. PATIL, J. Date :- 11th October, 2013. ORAL ORDER :-\n\nHeard. Shri Anant Vasudev Kamat, Voluntary Liquidator is present in the Court. He presented an application of Mrs. Maria E.T. Marquis, addressed to the Voluntary Liquidator on 30th August, , along with a copy of her Aadhaar Card and Death Certificate of Joseph Anthony Urban Marquis. The application, along with the annexures, are taken on record and marked X . . Mr. Kamat, Voluntary Liquidator submits that the legal heir of the deceased Joseph Anthony Urban Marquis has submitted the said application. She informed the Voluntary Liquidator that it is an old case in respect of which she is not in a position to submit any document to support the claim of her husband regarding payment of Rs.4740/-. The Voluntary Liquidator, therefore, prays that the proceedings could be closed being an old matter and in view of there being no documents placed on record. The Voluntary Liquidator further submitted that an amount of Rs.1500/- had remained with him, which was deposited in the Government Treasury prior to 20 to 25 years back. . Ms. Razaq, learned Counsel appearing for the Official Liquidator, as regards the contentions raised by the applicant in paras and 11 of the application, on instructions from the Official Liquidator who is present in the Court, submits that except this claim, nothing remains now to be settled and in case the submissions of the Voluntary Liquidator are accepted, these company applications could be closed by declaring that the Company stands dissolved under Section 497 of the Companies Act, 1956. . I have perused the record placed before me, and considered the submissions advanced. I have also perused the application filed by Mrs. Maria E.T. Marquis addressed to Mr. Anant V. Kamat, Voluntary Liquidator along with the annexures thereto. . The Directors of the company had filed a declaration of solvency dated 8th April, 1988 as required under Section 488 of the Companies Act, 1956 in the Office of Registrar of Companies, Goa, Daman & Diu, at Panaji. The Shareholders of the Company vide resolution dated 28th April, 1988 had resolved that the company should be voluntary wound up and Mr. Anant Vasudev Kamat, Chartered Accountant, Panaji was appointed as the Voluntary Liquidator of the Company. M/s. Holiday Hotels (Goa) Private Limited was incorporated as a Private Limited Company, limited by shares on 15th March, 1974 with an authorized capital of Rs.10,00,000/-. The Company had 19 shareholders and four Directors. The last audited balance sheet of the company is available with the Office of Registrar of Companies, as of 25th March, 1988. The applicant has described the assets and liabilities of the Company as were available at the relevant time. The Voluntary Liquidator has filed with the Registrar of Companies, final return of winding up in Form No.157 pursuant to Section 497(3) of the Companies Act, 1956. Receipt and payment account is mentioned in para 7 of the application. . The applicant has contended in para 9 of the application as under : 9. That having regard to the fact that nothing objectionable has been found in conducting the proceedings of voluntary winding up of the company by Shri. Anant Vasudev Kamat, Voluntary Liquidator, as such the official liquidator submits for kind consideration of this Hon'ble High Court that the affairs of the company do not appear to have been conducted in a manner prejudicial to the interest of its members or to public interest. .

Respondents Mr. Santosh Shetty i/b Mr. M.M. Vashi for the petitioner. Mr. D.B. Sawant for the respondent Nos.1 and 2. CORAM: ANOOP V. MOHTA, J. DATED: 23RD AUGUST, 2004. ORAL JUDGMENT : . The present Petition is under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, filed by the petitioner (Assistant teacher) and thereby, has challenged the order and judgment dated 27th October, 1989, passed by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, Mumbai [for short Tribunal ], in Appeal No. GEN/71/SND/3 of , whereby, the Tribunal, had allowed the Appeal but only granted the benefit under Section 11(2)(e) of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 (for short MEPS Act ) and directed to pay six months' salary by way of compensation instead of reinstatement, although the termination order dated 30th March, 1988, of the petitioner was set aside. The Petitioner, being aggrieved, therefore, has basically prayed for reinstatement as permanent Assistant Teacher and all other benefits. . Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. The basic issue which needs to be answered in this Petition is the right of the petitioner, being an open category candidate, to have a status of permanency as Assistant Teacher on a reserved post. . The provisions of the MEPS Act and the Rules made thereunder govern the recruitment and conditions of service of employees in private Schools. The relevant Sections are Sections 4, 5 and 9. The relevant Rules are called the Maharashtra Employees of Private School Rules [for short `MEPS Rules']. The relevant Rules, which covers the case in hand, are Rule 9 and 28. . The petitioner was appointed temporarily in the post of Assistant Teacher for the period 1984-1985 and 1985-1986. Thereafter, he was appointed on probation for a period of two years under Section 9(5) of the MEPS Act. The said appointment order itself contained a clause that his appointment would be subject to the approval of the Education Department of District Sindhudurg. The respondent-Management, however, by an order dated 30th March, 1988, terminated the services of the petitioner. The petitioner, therefore, preferred an Appeal under Section 9 of the MPES Act and Rules. The School Tribunal, after considering the contentions raised, including the written submissions filed by respondents, passed the impugned order and held that the impugned termination notice dated 30th March, 1988, was illegal, invalid and improper. Accordingly, the Appeal was allowed. However, not granted reinstatement with back wages, after recording the statement that 'a suitable substitute from S.T. category is posted'. The respondents were directed to give him six months salary only. . It appears from the record, as well as, the Written Statement filed by the Management that the post in question was reserved for SC/ST candidate. As per the advertisement, the petitioner was appointed for the respective years, subject to the approval from the Education Department, Zilla Parishad, Sindhudurg. The said appointment was purely temporary. As there was no candidate available, belonging to the said reserved category, petitioner was appointed temporarily, on the said post. The said process was continued for two years more. The respondent's case is that as the candidate belonging to the reserved category were not available or did not respond to the advertisement and, therefore, were left with no choice, but to appoint the petitioner on a temporary basis. The foundation of the respondents cannot be overlooked as the post was meant for reserved categories and this post was always subject to the approval from the Education Department. There is no dispute that the petitioner belongs to the open category. The petitioner's entitlement to enjoy the post, in the circumstances, would be subject to the non-availability of reserved category candidate or such other candidate. The fact that he was appointed from time to time from the year 1984 upto 1987-1988, by that itself, nowhere gives any right to such candidate to claim permanency, even after expiry of the alleged probation period, in the facts and circumstances of the case. . In this background and in view of the submission as raised and as referred in the Written Statement, as well as, recorded by the Tribunal in paragraph , I am also of the view that now, at this stage, i.e. after more than 15 years, it is difficult to accept the prayer of reinstatement. The finding given by the Tribunal is also justified to maintain the order to the effect that 'unless the said post becomes de-reserved', a candidate appointed temporarily on such vacancy of ST/SC category would have only status of 'temporary' candidate. . A candidate from the open category cannot claim a right of permanency, on the said reserved post. There is nothing pointed out that such post becomes de-reserved automatically after lapse of time or any other such things. In the circumstances, appellant being open category candidate would have no right to hold the post meant for reserved category candidate. The `quota' or any action based on the Reservation Policy cannot be disturbed without following the due procedure of law. . It needs to be mentioned here that if candidates belonging to the SC/ST category are not available, the petitioner's case may be considered by the Management, if there is still a vacancy and/or the post is still required to be filled in. However, the Management is at liberty to consider this aspect, if a case is made out on merit. . In view of this observation, I decline to interfere with the finding recorded by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, dated 27th October, 1989, hence termination is upheld. . The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of. No order as to costs. Certified copy expedited. [ANOOP V. MOHTA, J.]",

Rakesh Kumar Jain,J:\n\nThis order shall dispose of two contempt appeals i.e. CACP No. 19 of 1998 and 17 of 1998. The facts are, however, taken from CACP No. 19 of 1998. Civil Contempt Appeal No 19 of 1998 -2- The respondents filed C.W.P.No.19664 of 1996 seeking a writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing notice issued for winding up Dadri Education Society, Charkhi Dadri, District Bhiwani and its merger with Dadri Education Trust and also a writ in the nature of prohibition for holding meeting on 29.12.1996 for merging Dadri Education Society into a Trust. In this writ petition, on 20.12.1996, notice of motion was issued for 06.2.1997 and operation of Annexure P-5 (notice dated .11.1996) was stayed meanwhile. The petitioners filed C.O.C.P.No. 65 of 1997 under Sections and 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 against Ram Kishan Gupta and Mange Ram for disobeying the order dated 20.12.1996 passed in C.W.P.No.19664 of 1996 titled Jai Parkash and others v. State of Haryana and others, on the ground that inspite of stay order dated .12.1996, both Ram Kishan Gupta and Mange Ram held meeting at the residence of Ram Kishan Gupta on 29.12.1996, and passed a resolution regarding winding up of Dadri Education Society and its merger with Dadri Educational Trust. The contempt petition was contested by both the respondents therein in which Ram Kishan Gupta had inter-alia pleaded that he remained admitted as an indoor patient in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi from 04.12.1996 to 28.12.1996 and was discharged on .12.1996, therefore, he had no knowledge of the stay order passed by this Court. However, this plea was not accepted and vide order dated .9.1998, it was held that both the contemners were aware of the stay order and the meeting that had taken place had wilfully floated the order dated Civil Contempt Appeal No 19 of 1998 -3- .12.1996. They were,thus, held guilty of Contempt of Court and were punished for simple imprisonment for a term of three months' each and also a fine of Rs.2000/- each and in default of making the payment of fine, they were ordered to undergo imprisonment for another term of 15 days. It was ordered that if the fine is recovered, the same shall be paid to the petitioners by way of compensation. The contempt petition was allowed with costs which was assessed at Rs. 20,000/- to be shared by both the respondents equally. Both Ram Kishan Gupta and Mange Ram filed separate appeals under Sections 19 (1) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 against the order dated 22.9.1998 passed by learned Single Judge, which was registered as Civil Contempt Appeal No. 17 of 1998 titled as Mange Ram v. Jai Parkash and others and Civil Contempt Appeal No.19 of titled as Ram Kishan Gupta v. Jai Parkash and others. The appeals were admitted on 29.4.1999. The judgment to the extent of awarding imprisonment and costs was stayed. We have heard Mr.O.P.Goyal, Senior Advocate with Ms.Priya Khanna and Mr. R.A.Sheoran,Advocates, for the appellant(s) in both the appeals and Mr. Jaswant Jain,Advocate, for the respondents and have perused the record. At the out-set, Mr. O.P. Goyal, learned Senior Counsel has submitted that his client Ram Kishan Gupta is an old man of 91 years of age and is a heart patient. He has further submitted that appellants hold this Court and all other Courts established by law in the highest esteem. The appellants also tendered unqualified apology and has purged the contempt. Similar is the prayer made by Mr. R,A.Sheoran, counsel for the Civil Contempt Appeal No 19 of 1998 -4- other contemner Mange Ram.\n\nThough, we find that the contempt is made out , yet in view of the fact that the appellant Ram Kishan Gupta is 91 years of age, a heart patient and has purged the contempt, similarly appellant Mange Ram has also purged the contempt, we deem it appropriate to set aside the order of sentence and reduce the amount of compensation to Rs.10,000/- only in both the cases, to which counsel for the respondents has raised on objection. With above modification, both the appeals are hereby partly allowed and it is ordered that the sentence imposed upon the appellants by the learned Single Judge is of three months simple imprisonment, is set aside. But the appellants shall have to pay the fine as well as costs which is reduced to Rs.10000/- each in both the appeals to be shared by both the appellants equally. (Rakesh Kumar Jain) Judge.

Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment ? Yes/No . To be referred to the Reporters or not ? Yes/No . Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? Yes/No -.- K. KANNAN J. . There is no representation on behalf of the appellants. Learned counsel for the respondents is present and ready. Having regard to the fact that the appeal is of the year 1983 and it is identified by this Court on the administrative side as one of the oldest cases to be taken up immediately for disposal on merits, I proceed to dispose of the case on the basis of records and with the assistance of counsel for the respondents on merits. . The plaintiffs, who had filed the suit for declaration lost at the trial Court as well as the Appellate Court. They are in appeal before this Court assailing the decisions. The suit was for a declaration that the order passed by the District Collector Sangrur on 26.07.1969 -2- allotting the property measuring 5 bighas 5 biswas in Khasra No.1387 in village Chaunda in favour of Bhag Singh arrayed as the defendant was void and for a permanent injunction restraining Bhag Singh from, in any manner, interfering with the plaintiffs' possession. It must be immediately noticed that the suit for declaration as referred to in the preamble of the plaint is distinct from the way the prayer column is couched in paragraph 12, where the declaration sought is that the cancellation of allotment of land made in favour of the plaintiffs' was void and for an injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the possession. The inconsistency could be reconciled only by the fact that admittedly the property was the subject of allotment in the year 1961 under Nazool Land Transfer Rules, 1956 by the Deputy Commissioner (Collector) Sangrur on 15.06.1961 and the plaintiffs themselves had made reference to the fact that this allotment had been cancelled subsequently on 13.07.1978. The plaintiff is contending that this cancellation was void ab initio since the same has been passed against the principles of natural justice. The subsequent allotment made in favour of the 2nd defendant was, therefore, contended to be not valid and the plaintiffs had sought for restraint against them from interfering with the plaintiffs' possession. . The State remained ex parte and gave no reason as to how the proceedings were initiated for cancellation of allotment in the year 1978 and how a fresh allotment was made in favour of the 2nd defendant. The Courts below, however, held that there was no proof that the property had been even allotted in favour of the plaintiffs and that possession of the property had been handed over to the plaintiffs. The Court also -3- found that there had been a cancellation of order of allotment and the plaintiff could not file a suit without challenging the cancellation itself. A mere characterization of the cancellation as void cannot be a ground for upholding the claim for injunction against the defendant. The suit is contested only by the legal representatives of the private respondents in whose favour the subsequent allotment was made. . On the basis of pleadings, the following substantial questions of law arise for consideration. (i) whether the Courts below were justified in dismissing the plaintiffs' suit rested on alleged allotment in favour of the plaintiffs by the State on 15.06.1961 on the ground that the allotment had not been proved when the action of the State or functionaries must be presumed to be valid as an official act unless there are valid grounds brought by the State to justify the cancellation of allotment? (ii) whether the alleged cancellation of allotment in favour of the plaintiff purported to have been done on 13.07.1978 legal and void? (iii)whether the State is entitled to assign the property through an allotment in favour of the 2nd defendant? (iv) whether the allotment of the property in favour of the 2nd defendant-Bhag Singh valid to entitle the allottee to displace the claim of the plaintiffs in respect of the disputed property? . On the first point of whether the allotment made in favour of the plaintiffs made on 15.06.1961 could have been cancelled, I find that even the alleged letter of allotment is not produced before the Court. The relevant Rules themselves show that transfer of Nazool Lands under Rule 3 could be made to a Cooperative Society comprising of persons belonging to Scheduled Castes family. Rule 9-A of Nazool Land Transfer Rules of 1956 reads as follows:- -4- 9(A)(i): The arrears of instalments due under these rules shall be recoverable as arrears of land revenue. (ii) In case of Cooperative Society/individual member consistently makes default in making payment of two instalments of price of Nazool land, the Collector may review the case and cancel the allotment of land to the cooperative society/individual member whereupon the land shall revert to Government. (iii) The cooperative society/individual member concerned may file an appeal to the Commissioner against the Collector's order within sixty days of the date of that order, and the Commissioner's order passed in appeal shall be final. . In this case, the cancellation of properties could have been made for non-payment of installments. The Courts below have held that there is no proof that the property had been even specifically allotted in favour of the plaintiffs. Admittedly, the transfer itself has not been completed by a certificate of transfer. A mere allotment does not grant a right to the property itself. It merely is the first stage of obtaining a right. If it does not fructify into a transfer deed in the manner provided, then no vested right can ever obtain. Rule 11 prescribes a mode of transfer, which is reproduced as under:- 11. Certificate of transfer:- (1) As soon as the last installment of price has been paid by the Cooperative Societies or the individual member of the Scheduled Caste, as the case may be, in whose favour the transfer has been made under the Rules, the Collector shall grant to it or him under his signatures and seal a certificate of transfer of ownership in the revised Form 'B' appended to these Rules. . The Hon'ble Supreme Court recently held in the judgment in Greater Mohali Area Development Authority and others Vs. Manju Jain AIR 2010 SC 3817 that a merely letter of allotment itself cannot be a basis for claiming title to the property. Rule 9-A, which we have extracted above again contains a provision for challenging an order of -5- cancellation. The plaintiffs, who had taken notice of the cancellation could not have merely treated the proceedings as void without resorting to the procedure prescribed under the Act. The plaintiffs' action for injunction cannot lie and more so, when the plaintiffs have not been able to show their possession continuously in pursuance of their allotment. . The questions of law raised are answered against the appellants/plaintiffs and the appeal is dismissed. (K. KANNAN) JUDGE November 04, 2011 Pankaj*",

Revision No. 1057 of 1997 -2- bail on 10.12.1997. Learned counsel for the petitioner has not challenged the conviction of the petitioner for the offence under Section 379 IPC. However, he has submitted that the occurrence in question had taken place more than nineteen years earlier. The amount said to have been stolen by the petitioner was recovered from him when he was shown to have been apprehended while running away from the spot. The petitioner is not a previous convict. He has already deposited the fine imposed upon him by the trial Court. Out of the sentence of one year, he has served an actual period of one and a half months. Therefore, the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the petitioner be reduced to that already undergone by him. On the other hand, learned State counsel has opposed the prayer made on behalf of the petitioner by submitting that the petitioner had pushed the complainant while alighting from a bus at Bus Stand Sadhaura and in the process took out Rs.110/- from the right pocket of the pant worn by the complainant. He tried to run away from the spot but was overpowered by the persons present there and the amount of Rs.110/- was recovered from him. Therefore, he does not deserve any leniency in the matter of sentence. When the petitioner was heard by the trial Court on the quantum of sentence, he had stated that he had small children to support and was the only bread earner of the family. The petitioner has been Crl. Revision No. 1057 of 1997 -3- facing the agony of criminal prosecution since the month of March, . From the records, it is apparent that after being taken into custody on 8.3.1991, the petitioner was released on bail on 9.3.1991. He was again taken into custody on 3.11.1997 when his appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the lower appellate Court. It was only on 10.12.1997 that he was ordered to be released on bail. Taking into consideration the totality of the circumstances, the Court is of the view that no useful purpose would be served by sending the petitioner behind the bars, once again, for undergoing the remainder of his sentence. Ends of justice would be amply met if the substantive sentence of the petitioner is reduced to that already undergone by him. Resultantly, the conviction of the petitioner under Section IPC is upheld. His substantive sentence of imprisonment is reduced to that already undergone by him. Except for the modification in the quantum of sentence of imprisonment to the extent as indicated above, the revision fails and is, therefore, dismissed. ( T.P.S. MANN ) July 02, 2010 JUDGE ajay-1",

Revision No.135 of 1998\n\nMohan Chand Joshi ....... Petitioner. Versus State ( U.T.Chandigarh ) ...... Respondent. CORAM:- HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K.C. PURI Present : Mr. Gurinder Pal Singh, Advocate for the revisionist in both cases. Mr. Rajeev Sharma, Advocate for U.T.Chandigarh in both cases. K.C.PURI, J. By this common order, I intend to dispose of Criminal Revision No.134 of 1998 titled Mohan Chand Joshi vs. State ( U.T.Chandigarh ) and Criminal Revision No.135 of 1998 titled Mohan Chand Joshi vs. State ( U.T.Chandigarh ) , as both the revisions arise from the same FIR and against the same accused. For convenience, facts are being taken from Criminal Revision No.134 of 1998. These are two revision petitions against the judgment dated 18.12.1997 passed by Shri S.S.Lamba, Additional Sessions Judge, Chandigarh, who dismissed the appeal, while reducing the sentence of imprisonment awarded by the trial Court from two years rigorous imprisonment to one year rigorous imprisonment and by maintaining the amount of fine as Rs.1000/-, whereas Shri J.S.Khushdil, learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Chandigarh vide judgment and order dated 17.5.1986 sentenced the revisionist to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/- and in default of payment of fine to undergo rigorous impressment for three months holding him guilty under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code (in short the IPC). The brief facts of the prosecution case are that on the complaint made by Chief Executive Officer, Haryana State Federation of Consumer Cooperative Whole Sale Stores,( in short the Federation) against the revisionist. It is alleged in the complaint that revisionist was appointed as salesman in this Federation on .10.1973 and he took over the charge of the stocks of retail shop on .10.1973. The normal duties of a salesman were to receive goods from the main godown through an indent duly signed by him and the godown keeper after due checking and satisfaction and to sell the same in retail at his shop at the rates and in accordance with the policy approved by the Federation. After the close of the day, the revisionist was required to prepare the sales summaries of the sales made during the day and to hand over the sales proceeds of the day to the cashier of the Federation against receipt. He was also responsible for stocking, selling custody and accountability of the goods given to him by the Federation from time to time. The financial transactions of the goods supplied to him and the sales duly made by him were kept by the office of the Federation in a register called as Stock Liability Register. The entries made in this register by the office were also signed by the salesman in token of having accepted the liability from time to time. The revisionist was also supposed to conducted physical verification in the presence of the salesman and the list of goods physically verified is signed by the auditors as well as by the salesman in token of its correctness. According to physical verification report for the period ending 31.12.1975 the value of goods in the custody of Mohan Chand, salesman, amounted to Rs.88,119.53ps. This was taken as opening balance of stocks with the salesman from 1.1.1976. The value of goods given to the sales from 1.1.1976 to 3.2.1976 as well as sales affected by him and the amount deposited with the Federation. As per physical verification of the stocks in the charge of revisionist for the period ending 30.6.1975 and 31.12.1975 heavy shortages were found in the stocks entrusted to him in the capacity of a salesman. The revisionist was therefore, asked to hand over the charge of his stocks to Ram Lal Godown Keeper and the same was handed over the charge of stocks worth Rs.58,672-73ps to Ram Lal Storekeeper on 3.2.1976 whereas according to the stock liability register, the value of goods in his charge as on 3.2.1976 should have been Rs.67,397-20ps. There was thus a shortage of stock duly entrusted to him in the capacity of a salesman worth Rs.8724-47ps. which revisionist has embezzled. The investigation of this case was conducted by SI Brij Lal, who took into possession necessary documents and recorded the statements of the prosecution witnesses. After completion of necessary investigation, challan against the revisionist was presented in the trial Court for trial. On appearance of the accused in the Court, copies of the documents were supplied to the accused under rules. Finding a prima facie case, the accused was charge- sheeted under Section 409 IPC to which he pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. In order to establish its case, prosecution has examined Vijay Kumar (PW-1), Sudama Mool Chandani (PW-2), Om Parkash (PW2/B), Jagdish Chander (PW-3), Ramesh Chander (PW-4), Subash Chander Jain (PW-5), K.N.Parshad (PW-6), Om Parkash (PW-7), Mohinder Singh (PW-8), SI Brij Lal (PW-9), SI Nana Ram (PW-10), K.K.Sharma (PW-11), Ram Lal (PW-12), Shri J.P.Gupta (PW-13), SI Sandel Singh (PW-14) and Nanak Singh (PW-15) and the evidence was closed by order of the Court as the prosecution failed to conclude its entire evidence. After conclusion of the trial, the accused was examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C., all the incriminating evidence was put to him which he denied and pleaded his false implication. He has admitted that he was working as Salesman. He has also admitted that the goods were received from the CONFED Store through indent, and after that those were put on sale. He has admitted that the entries were made by the storekeeper and his signatures were obtained. He has stated that the original liability register has been intentionally concealed by the prosecution, just to prosecute him. He has stated that the signatures on the liability register were obtained under pressure and undue influence. The accused has examined Sher Singh as DW-1 and Suresh Kumar as DW-2 and then close his defence evidence. The learned trial Court, after appraisal of the evidence, found the accused guilty and sentenced him as narrated above. The revisionist filed appeal against that judgment. The appellate Court on re-appraisal of the evidence did not find any merit in the appeal and dismissed the same, however, while reducing the sentence from two years to one year only. Still dis-satisfied with the aforesaid judgments and orders the accused/revisionist filed instant revision petition before this Court. I have heard learned counsel for the revisionist and learned State counsel and have gone through the records of the case. Learned counsel for the revisionist has submitted that primary evidence of embezzlement is missing in the present case. The liability register, which reflected all the entries in respect of issuance of articles to the salesman are incorporated in the liability register. The original liability register has been withheld by the prosecution on the ground that there were cuttings in the entries in that register. The new liability register was prepared. The signatures against the entries were taken by the Officers under the threat. Even some of the entries do not bear the signatures of petitioner. Since the primary evidence is missing and as such the prosecution has failed to prove the alleged embezzlement. I have considered the said submission and have gone through the records of the case. Both the Courts below have thrashed this point and reached to the conclusion that preparation of new liability register does not create doubt on the prosecution version. Signatures of revisionist appear on all the entries except one or two entries in respect of issuance of articles. Even if, the entries, which did not bear the signatures of revisionist, ignored in that case also the embezzlement stood proved. Moreover, in this case, the primary evidence is not the liability register but the primary evidence is in the shape of issuance of indent for sale of articles by the petitioner, who happened to be salesman at that time. The revisionist has failed to count for the articles issued to him through indents and there were shortage, as observed by both the Courts below. So, no scope for interference in the present revision petition is made out. The learned counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that revisionist filed complaint against the other officers, who have actually embezzled the amount. The learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, has not reached to the logical conclusion as provided under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The big guns have been shielded to make the petitioner scape goat. not find any force in that submission. In case the Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, has not taken the cognizance, the petitioner would have the remedy by filing a private complaint but he has not done so. So, now after so many years, the petitioner cannot grumbled over the said matter. Learned counsel for the revisionist has further submitted that some time the goods were taken by the higher officers on credit basis. The petitioner being a small employee could not say no to the officers and helm of the affair. Both the Courts below have not considered this aspect. not find force in that. The goods alleged to be given on credit although not proved but according to the petitioner itself the value of the same is very less i.e Rs.800/-. Even if, some officers have taken the goods on credit in that case, the petitioner was required to issue the bills and get the signature of that officers. But, there is nothing in this case on the file. So, the above said argument is also without any substance. Learned counsel for the revisionist has further submitted that the petitioner has been discriminated. According to the policy of the department, the salesman was entitled to have a shortage of half meter per every than of cloth. This concession is allowed to the employee as the same extra cloth has to be given to the person, who purchased the same. The said concession has been withheld in the case of petitioner regarding shortage on account of embezzlement. not find any merit in that submission. Even if, concession of shortage by half meter is allowed to the petitioner in that case also the huge shortage of articles would not be accounted for. The shortage can be in respect of the clothes only. So far as other items such as tyres are concerned there cannot be shortage in respect of those items. So, the petitioner cannot have benefit of the above said argument. Learned counsel for the revisionist has submitted that there is overwriting in some of the indents, the benefit of the same has not been given to the petitioner. not fine any merit in that submission. No specific act of overwriting prejudicial to the petitioner has been pointed out during the course of arguments. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that in para-5 of the grounds of revision the petitioner has given the details in respect of shortage of value of Rs.82,686.58ps. against the shortage of Rs.88,119.53ps if these six items are taken into account, there is no shortage. not fine any merit in that submission. No reasonable ground for arriving at the conclusion that shortage of the stock is counted for as detailed in para-5 of the grounds of appeal. These figures have been made by the petitioner for the first time in the revision petition, which cannot be looked into. The trial Court has appreciated the evidence on the record of this case minutely. The first Appellate Court reprised the said evidence carefully and no scope is left for interference in the concurrent finding of both the Courts below proving guilt of the petitioner. Consequently, the conviction recorded by both the Courts below stand affirmed. So far as quantum of sentence is concerned, the shortage relates to the period 1974-76 i.e. more than 33 years. The petitioner is facing the protracted trial since the year 1982 i.e. more than 27 years. Learned counsel for the petitioner has stated at the bar that the petitioner has undergone incarceration for a period of 70 days out of substantive sentence of one year. It would not be in the interest of justice to send the revisionist to custody, who has been facing the agony of trial for the last 27 years and had also undergone incarceration of 70 days. Consequently, the sentence is reduced to the already undergone by him. However, the sentence of fine under Section 409 IPC is enhanced to Rs.3000/-. With the above said modification in the sentence, the revision petition stands disposed of. A copy of this judgment be sent to the trial Court for strict compliance.\n\n( K.C.PURI )\n\nJUDGE September 15, 2009 sv",

Versus Surjit Kaur and others. ...........Respondents. CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VINOD K. SHARMA Present : None for the appellant. Mr.Sameer Sachdeva,Advocate for respondent No.1. **** VINOD K. SHARMA,J.( ORAL ) This order will dispose of F.A.O. Nos. 1663 and 1647 of 1997. For the sake of convenience, the facts are being taken from F.A.O. No. 1663 of 1997. Both these appeals filed by the Pepsu Road Transport Corporation arising out of the common award passed by the learned Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Faridkot in MACT cases Nos. 38 and 39 dated .10.1992. Claimant-respondents herein filed a claim petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act claiming compensation on account of death of Sandhura Singh in a motor vehicular accident. The precise facts of the case are that Sandhura Singh deceased and Gurdial Singh claimant in MACT case No. 39 dated 31.10.1992 were travelling on scooter No. PCO 3454 on 9.5.1992. The scooter was driven by Sh. Gurdial Singh whereas Sandhura Singh deceased was sitting on the [2] pillion. When they reached near the service station of Karnail Singh in the revenue estate of village Badhni Kalan a bus bearing registration No. PB- A-9254 belonging to Pepsu Road Transport Corporation Barnala Depot, which was being driven by Kewal Singh respondent No.6 herein rashly and negligently came from the side of Barnala and without blowing horn struck against the scooter. The scooter was said to be driven on left side of the road and in the said accident both the driver and the pillion rider sustained injuries. In the Civil Hospital, Moga Sh. Sandhura Singh succumbed to his injuries whereas Gurdial Singh survived. The claimants in claim petition No. MACT 38 dated 31.10.1992 claimed a sum of Rs. 8,05,000/- as compensation on account of the death of Sandhura Singh whereas Gurdial Singh claimant in another case claimed Rs. 12,87,162/- on account of injuries sustained in the accident. The claim petition was contested by respondent Nos. 1 to 3 before the Tribunal wherein a stand was taken that the accident occurred due to the rash and negligent driving by Gurdial Singh scooter driver. It was further claimed that Sandhura Singh was not earning anything and that he was a liability on the family. The quantum of compensation was also challenged. It was also claimed that the bus was insured with respondent No.4 i.e. Insurance Company. It was further pleaded that accident had occurred due to breaking of leaf ( road spring) which was unforeseen circumstance. The insurance company disputed its liability to pay the compensation primarily on the ground that the insurance policy was cancelled. On the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed in claim petition No. MACT 38 dated 31.10.1992 by the learned Tribunal :- [3] . Whether Sandhura Singh died because of the rash and negligent driving of bus No. PB-11-A 9254 belonging to P.R.T.C. Barnala Depot by Kewal Singh respondent on .5.1992 at about 7:00 a.m.?OPP . Whether the claimants are the legal heirs/dependent of the deceased? OPP . Whether this bus was insured with United India Insurance Company and the insurance policy was in force on 9.5.1992 and further the said Insurance Policy was enforceable against the United India Insurance Company Ltd. Moga ? OPR 1 & 2. . To what amount of compensation the claimants are entitled to, if so, from whom? OPP . Relief. The following issues were framed in claim petition titled Gurdial Singh Vs. P.R.T.C. by the learned Tribunal :- . Whether Gurdial Singh suffered personal injury on .5.1992 at about 7:00 a.m. on account of the rash and negligent driving of bus No.PB-11-A-9254 belonging to P.R.T.C. Barnala Depot by Kewal Singh respondent ? OPP . To what amount of compensation the claimant is entitled to, if so, from whom ? OPP . Whether the bus was insured with United India Insurance Company and the Insurance Policy was in force on [4] .5.1992 and further the said insurance policy was enforceable against the United India Insurance Company Ltd. Moga ? OPR 1 & 2. . Relief. The learned Tribunal on issue No.1 came to the conclusion that the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Bus No. PB- -A-9254 belonging to P.R.T.C. Barnala Depot which was driven by Kewal Singh respondent. This finding has been recorded on the basis of evidence led before the Tribunal especially in view of the fact that the stand taken by the driver of the bus was that the leaf of the front wheel ( road spring) had broken earlier and was repaired temporarily, which was the cause of accident. Accordingly, the learned Tribunal came to the conclusion that in such a situation, the bus should have been kept off the road till it was properly repaired. On issue No.2 the learned Tribunal has held that the claimants are the legal heirs of the deceased. On issue No.3, the learned Tribunal came to the conclusion that the bus was insured with the Insurance Company respondent No.4. It is pertinent to mention here that against this very award the Insurance Company had filed FAO No.1725 of 1997, which was disposed of on .12.1997. The insurance Company was absolved of its liability to pay the compensation keeping in view the fact that civil suit filed by the appellant herein against the cancellation of insurance policy was dismissed. On issue No. 4, the learned Tribunal was pleased to grant a sum of Rs. 3,26,000/- ( Rs. three lakh and twenty six thousand only) as compensation to claimants in MACT case No.38 dated 31.10.1992 whereas [5] in MACT case No. 39 dated 31.10.1992 Gurdial Singh injured was granted a sum of Rs. 1,25,000/- as compensation. The claimants were also held entitled to interest @ 12% per annum. In the grounds of appeal the appellant had challenged the award primarily on the ground that the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent driving of scooter driver and also on the ground that no independent witnesses were examined. There is no force in this contention as the learned Tribunal on appreciation of evidence has come to the conclusion that the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent driving by Kewal Singh while driving bus No.PB-11-A-9254. Sh. Gurdial Singh admittedly was an eye witness to the accident. It was also claimed that the compensation granted was highly excessive. There is no force in this contention also as Rs. 3,26,000/- ( Rs. three lakh and twenty six thousand only) for an agriculturist, who was 32 years of age at the time of accident, cannot be said to be excessive. Accordingly, there is no merit in the present appeals, hence, the same are dismissed. February 7,2007\n\n( VINOD K. SHARMA ) 'sp' JUDGE",

JUSTICE T.P.S. MANN Present : Mr. D.S. Malwai, Advocate as Amicus Curiae for the petitioner. Mr. Rajiv Sharma, Advocate for Union Territory, Chandigarh. T.P.S. MANN, J. (Oral) The petitioner was tried for the offence punishable under Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act on the allegations that on 13.6.1990, he was found in possession of about 500 bottles of sweetened carbonated water (orange) for sale in village Darua and the sample drawn therefrom was found to contain brominated vegetable oil, use of which was not permitted. Vide judgment and order dated 13.9.1994, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chandigarh convicted the petitioner for the aforementioned offence and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for one month. The amount of fine was paid. Aggrieved of his conviction and sentence, the petitioner filed -2- an appeal but the same was dismissed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chandigarh on 1.3.1997 by maintaining his conviction and sentence. Learned counsel for the petitioner has not challenged the conviction of the petitioner. However, he has submitted that the sample was drawn from the petitioner on 13.6.1990. After receipt of the report from the Chemical Examiner, the criminal proceedings were initiated against the petitioner in the month of October, 1990 when a criminal complaint was filed by the Food Inspector. Ever since then, the petitioner has been facing the agony of criminal prosecution. The present revision has remained pending in this Court for the last more than 13 years. Consequent upon the dismissal of his appeal by the lower appellate Court, the petitioner was taken into custody on 1.3.1997 and it was only on 18.3.1997 that he was granted the concession of bail during the pendency of his revision. Therefore, the substantive sentence of the petitioner be reduced to that already undergone by him. Learned counsel representing the Union Territory of Chandigarh has opposed the prayer made on behalf of the petitioner by submitting that as the sweetened carbonated water (orange) sold by the petitioner was found adulterated, therefore, the petitioner has rightly been sentenced to minimum imprisonment and fine and the same cannot be reduced. In Parshadi V State of Haryana 2004(2) R.C.R. (Criminal) , the sentence of a similarly situated accused, who stood convicted under Section 7 read with Section 16(1)(a)(i) of the Act was reduced to -3- that already undergone by him as he had been facing the trial for a period of fourteen years. However, his fine was enhanced. While doing so, the Court relied upon a number of judgments, viz, Mahavir V. State through Govt. Food Inspector, 2000(4) RCR(Crl.) 208, Behari Lal V. State of (U.T.) Chandigarh, 2000(1) RCR(Crl.) 222, Des Raj V. The State of Haryana, 1996(1) RCR 689, Vijay Kumar V. The State of Haryana 1996 (2) RCR(Crl.) 554 (P&H), Mohinder Singh V. State (Chandigarh Administration), 1997(2) RCR(Crl.) 168 (P&H) and Satpal V. State of Haryana, 1997(4) RCR(Crl.) 15 (P&H). In Narinder Kumar V. State of Haryana 2008(2) All India Criminal Law Reporter 288, this Court, once again, reduced the sentence of a similarly situated convict to that already undergone by him as the occurrence pertained to the year 1984. It is a fact that the sword of criminal prosecution has remained hanging on the head of the petitioner for the last more than 20 years. The present revision has remained pending in this Court for more than 13 years. Out of the sentence of six months imposed upon him, the petitioner has already undergone a period of three weeks. When the petitioner was heard by the trial Court on the quantum of sentence, he had pleaded that he was a young person of 27 years of age and had a long way to go. There is no material on the file that the petitioner is a previous convict or that he is involved in any other crime. Keeping in view the observations made by different High Courts in the aforementioned judgments, I am of the view that no useful purpose would be served by sending the petitioner behind the bars, once again, so as to undergo -4- remainder of his sentence. Ends of justice would be amply met if the substantive sentence of the petitioner is reduced to that already undergone by him and at the same time enhancing the fine of Rs.1,000/- to Rs.10,000/-. Resultantly, the conviction of the petitioner for the offence under Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act is maintained. His substantive sentence of imprisonment is reduced to that already undergone by him. The fine of Rs.1,000/- is enhanced to Rs.10,000/-. The enhanced amount of fine be deposited by the petitioner with the trial Court within three months from today, failing which he shall be required to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months. The revision is, accordingly, disposed of. ( T.P.S.MANN ) May 27, 2010 JUDGE satish",

Complaint under Section 16(1) (c ) of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 was filed by Government Food Inspector on the allegation that on .1.1988 at about 5.30 P.M. he along with Dr. M.P.Lamburia, and other officials inspected the kiryana shop of Sardara Ram situated at bus stand Nangal Sirohi. Sardara Ram was found in possession of kiryana articles like gur, pulses, sugar, zeera etc. The Government Food Inspector after disclosing his identity had demanded a sample of 450 grams of Zeera for analysis against payment. 2 Kgs of Zeera was kept in a tin for public sale. Notice in form VI for taking the sample of Zeera was prepared. Food Inspector tried to serve notice then accused refused to accept the same and ran away from the shop after giving push to the Food Inspector. The Food Inspector and other officials are tried to catch hold of him but failed to apprehend him. After completing the necessary formalities, complaint was instituted. On merits, revisionist was convicted under Section 16(1)( c) of the Act and was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-. In default of payment of fine, he shall further undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one month. Feeling dissatisfied with the judgment of the learned Judicial Magisttrate, Ist Class, Mahendergarh, first appeal was preferred but the appeal was dismissed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Narnaul. Learned counsel for the revisionist argued that occurrence is dated 30.1.1988. At that time, revisionist was 54 years old. Now he is aged 75 years. Revisionist is the first offender. Impugned judgment is not challenged on the point of conviction. The learned counsel requested that a lenient view be taken on the point of sentence and order the revisionist to undergo imprisonment already undergone because the revisionist remained in custody about one and a half month. Mr. K.S.Godara, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana, for the respondent argued that there is no dispute that the revisionist is 75 years old. Occurrence was in the month January, 1988. He raised no objection if lenient view is taken in the matter of sentence. Evidence on the file shows that Government Food Inspector along with other officials on 30.1.1988 at about 5.30 P.M. had raided the Kiryana shop of the revisionist. Revisionist was found in possession of 2 Kg of Zeera kept for public sale. Against payment, Government Food Inspector demanded 450 grams of Zeera. Notice in From VI regarding taking of sample of Zeera was prepared but without signing the same revisionist had fled away from the spot after giving a push to the Food Inspector. In view of the evidence of the officials, both the Courts below had rightly opined the revisionist committed an offence punishable under Section 16(1) (c ) of the Act. At the time of commission of crime, revisionist was 54 years old. Now he is about 75 years. Occurrence is dated 30.1.1988. Revisionist remained in custody for about one and a half month. Revisionist is to become a hard criminal if he is sent to jail to undergo imprisonment, as ordered by the trial Court. Keeping in view the nature of offence and antecedents of the revisionist, I take a lenient view and order the revisionist to undergo imprisonment already undergone and he is also ordered to pay a fine of Rs.15000/-. Rs. 15,000/- is to be deposited before the trial Court within two months. In case the revisionist fails to pay the fine, the revision shall stand dismissed. With this modification, on the point of sentence, revision being without merit is dismissed. .7.2009 ( JORA SINGH ) Anoop JUDGE",

Present revision petition is directed against the order passed by the Rent Controller whereby application filed by the petitioner for leading additional evidence has been dismissed. Learned counsel for the petitioner has assailed the order. He has submitted that landlord was residing at a distant place. For this reason, he could not depose before the Rent Controller at the time of affirmative evidence. The court below has, thus, erred in rejecting the application for leading additional evidence. He has relied upon judgment of this court reported as Charan Singh vs. Ajit Singh 1999(Suppl.) Civil Court Cases 458. Learned counsel for the respondent has opposed the plea. He submits that petitioner has merely delayed the matter. Petitioner was granted ample opportunity to lead evidence in affirmative. He is merely trying to fill up lacuna in the case. Thus, trial court has rightly rejected his prayer for leading additional evidence. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. An eviction petition was instituted by respondent- landlord in the year 2001. After issues were framed, 7 effective opportunities were granted to him for leading evidence but petitioner failed to examine any witness. Petitioner closed his evidence on 05.05.2003.

At the time case came up for rebuttal evidence, petitioner made an effort to lead affirmative evidence. He examined one witness Ram Phal, an official from Food & Supply department.

Trial court rejected the plea observing that petitioner was granted sufficient opportunity to lead his evidence in affirmative but he failed to do so. I find no infirmity with the order passed by the court below. The judgment relied upon by counsel for the petitioner in Charan Singh case (supra) is not applicable to facts of this case.

The petitioner sold cotton seed oil which is claimed by the petitioner as edible oil fit for human consumption and on which sales tax @ 1% is leviable in terms of notification dated .1.1979. Such claim of the petitioner was not accepted by the Assessing Authority, Ludhiana in its order dated 7.2.1990. It was found that the Central Sales Tax on inter state sales of cotton seed oil other than edible oil fit for human consumption is 4% against C forms whereas the petitioner has deposited only 1%. The assessment was framed accordingly. The issue raised in the present petition was also raised in CWP No. 6919 of 1987. The said writ petition was allowed on 18.7.1991 by the learned Single Bench of this Court.

Due to non- production of the record as mentioned above, accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Accused was summoned to face trial. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued. Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Accused moved an application dated 11.2.1995 for dropping the proceedings on the allegation that complaint was instituted after the expiry of period of limitation, as per Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. Notice was issued to the complainant. Ultimately, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, opined that complaint is not maintainable being time barred and was dismissed. Feeling dissatisfied with the order dated 27.2.1996 this revision petition was instituted. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the revisionist argued that main complaint was presented on 10.11.1993. After summoning, accused had appeared on 23.11.1994. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued on 5.1.1995. Under the Act, no limitation is provided. Maximum sentence under Section 85(g) of the Act is two years and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-. Contribution is every month. Due to non-deposit of contribution offence under Sectilon 85(g) is a continuing offence. Learned counsel for the revisionist cited ESIC Vs. C.C.Santhakumar, JT 2006(10) SC 549. Learned counsel for the respondent argued that as per Section 468 Cr.P.C. complaint was not within limitation. Court has no power to take cognizance beyond the expiry of limitation. Due to non-production of record, complaint should have been filed within six months. As per the Act, question of limitation can be agitated at any stage even after cognizance is taken. In the present case, cognizance was taken on 5.1.1995 when notice was issued. As per allegation of the revisionist, respondent failed to produce record pertaining to the payment of contributions, inspection book, payment vouchers, ledgers and cash book etc for investigation for the period from .7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act.

It is clear, therefore, that the right of the Corporation to recover these amounts by coercive process is not restricted by any limitation nor could be the Government by recourse to the rule-making power prescribed a period in the teeth of Section 68. . In the above judgment this Court has clearly held that Section 68 of the Act empowers the Corporation to resort to coercive process, to recover the contribution from the employer as if it were an arrear of land revenue and the said right is not restricted by any limitation.

(ORAL) The petitioners pray for issuance of a writ of certiorari quashing order dated 14.10.1986, passed by the Joint Director, Panchayats, Punjab, exercising powers of the 'Commissioner' under the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961, (hereinafter referred to as the 1961 Act ). The controversy in the present petition is, whether the land, in dispute, which is recorded as the share of Shamilat Patti in Shamilat Deh, vests in the Gram Panchayat under Section 2(g)(3) of the Act. A perusal of Section 2(g)(3) of the 1961 Act reveals that a person or a Gram Panchayat claiming that land described as Shamilat Patti vests or does not vest in a Gram Panchayat, shall be required to -2- prove by a reference to the relevant revenue record that the land was or was not used for benefit of the village community or part thereof, or for common purposes of the village. The District Development and Panchayat Officer, Rupnagar, exercising the powers of the Collector, has held that the Gram Panchayat has failed to prove the ingredients of Section 2(g)(3) of the 1961 Act and dismissed the petition filed by the Gram Panchayat. The Joint Director, Panchayats, Punjab, exercising the powers of the 'Commissioner', has, however, reversed the order passed by the Collector but without recording any finding in terms of Section (g)(3) of the 1961 Act. Counsel for the parties agree, on instructions from their respective parties, that the writ petition may be allowed, the impugned order may be set aside and the matter may be remitted to the Director Panchayats, Punjab, Chandigarh, to decide the appeal afresh and in accordance with law. In view of agreement between counsel for the parties, the writ petition is allowed, the impugned order dated 14.10.1986 is set aside and the matter is remitted to the Director Panchayats, Punjab, Chandigarh, to decide the appeal afresh and in accordance with law within three months of parties putting in appearance before him on .07.2013. The Director Panchayats, Punjab, Chandigarh, shall grant an opportunity to both parties to lead additional evidence so as to -3- adduce relevant revenue record to prove their respective pleas. During pendency of the appeal, parties shall maintain status quo with respect to ownership, possession and the nature of the land, in dispute.\n\n[ RAJIVE BHALLA ]\n\nJUDGE .05.2013\n\n[ REKHA MITTAL ] shamsher\n\nJUDGE",

Khanna, Addl. A.G., Haryana, for respondents No.1 and 2. Mr. Sudhir Mittal, Advocate, for respondents No.3 to 6.\n\n* * * SATISH KUMAR MITTAL , J ( Oral ) This petition was filed by the petitioner challenging the order dated 5.12.1985 (Annexure P-4), passed by the Financial Commissioner, Haryana, whereby the revision petition filed by Nirupma Devi (respondent No.3 herein) daughter of Mahadev (a big land owner), challenging the order of sanctioning mutation of ownership qua the land in question, passed by the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, which was confirmed by the Collector, Hisar, was allowed and the matter was remanded to the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, for deciding the matter afresh, after hearing the parties and allowing them to lead evidence. -2- The brief facts of the case are that the petitioner was a tenant on Kanals of land, belonging to Mahadev, a big land-owner. The petitioner filed purchase application under Section 18 of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act, 1953 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act of 1953') for purchasing the said land. The Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, vide his order dated 5.7.1962, allowed the said application and permitted the petitioner to purchase the said land on payment of certain amount, which was to be paid in six equal monthly instalments. The petitioner did not make any payment. However, it was alleged by him that he made certain payment in that regard to the General Power of Attorney of said Mahadev. Thereafter, on 24.2.1975, the petitioner moved an application before the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, for sanctioning of mutation of ownership in his favour with regard to the said land, on the basis of the aforesaid purchase order. The Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, vide order dated 11.7.1975 (Annexure P-1) allowed the application and sanctioned mutation of the said land in favour of the petitioner. Aggrieved against the said order, Nirupama Devi (respondent No.3 herein) filed an appeal before the Collector, Hisar, on the ground that no instalment with regard to payment of the aforesaid amount was paid to the land-owner, which the petitioner was required to deposit in the Government Treasury. The said appeal filed by respondent No.3 was dismissed by the Collector, Hisar, vide order dated 7.9.1976 (Annexure P-2). The said order was challenged by respondent No.3 before the Commissioner, Hisar Division, -3- Hisar, who vide his order dated 12.3.1980 (Annexure P-3), after coming to the conclusion that the payment of instalment was not made by the petitioner, made reference to the Financial Commissioner, Haryana, with the recommendation to set aside the orders dated 11.7.1975 (Annexure P-1) and .9.1976 (Annexure P-2), passed by the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, and the Collector, Hisar, respectively, and to remand the case to the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar. Accordingly, the Financial Commissioner, Haryana, vide his order dated 5.12.1985 (Annexure P-4) accepted the said recommendation and remanded the matter. Though learned counsel for the petitioner is not present, but with the assistance of learned counsel for the respondents, I have gone through the impugned orders. The Commissioner, Hisar Division, Hisar, while recommending to the Financial Commissioner for setting aside the order of sanctioning the mutation, has observed that as per Rule 23 (3) of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Rules, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as `the Rules'), the tenant, in whose favour an order to purchase the land is passed, is required to deposit the amount of instalment within 15 days, either in a Government treasury or a sub-treasury or to pay it to the Assistant Collector Ist Grade. Admittedly, in the instant case, the petitioner has neither deposited any amount in a Government treasury or a sub- treasury nor he has made any payment in the court of Assistant Collector Ist Grade. He only alleges that some amount was paid by him to the General Power of Attorney of Mahadev, the big land owner, which has been denied -4- by the big land owner. In his order, the learned Commissioner has observed that the petitioner has not paid the price of the land to the land owner in terms of the order dated 5.7.1962. His statement to the effect that he had been paying instalments to the Munshi of Mahadev, the big land owner, cannot be accepted, because he has not produced any receipt issued by him. It has been further held that under Rule 23 (3) of the Rules, the amount of instalment fixed under Section 18 of the Act of 1953 could be deposited in the Treasury within 15 days after the decision of the Assistant Collector. In this regard, the learned Commissioner has relied upon a decision of the Financial Commissioner, in Peman Ram v. Smt. Kheoni and others, 1963 PLJ 35, wherein it was held that under Rule 23 (3) of the Rules, the tenant is required to deposit the compensation either in Government Treasury or Sub Treasury or to pay to the Assistant Collector Ist Grade having jurisdiction. Direct payment to the land owner has not been contemplated by the Rules. It has been further held that a tenant, who disregards the Rules and takes the risk of paying instalments to the land owner without getting a receipt, must pay for the consequences of his folly. The subsequent payment deposited by the tenant on 11.8.1973 was held to be illegal being time barred. Therefore, it was held that the Assistant Collector Ist Grade has committed grave illegality while sanctioning mutation of ownership in favour of the petitioner. The learned Financial Commissioner accepted the said recommendation made by the learned Commissioner and thereafter, set aside the orders dated 11.7.1975 (Annexure P-1) and 7.9.1976 (Annexure -5- P-2), passed by the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, and the Collector, Hisar, respectively, and remanded the case to the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar. I do not find any illegality in the said order and the same does not require any interference by this Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Dismissed.

State of Punjab CORAM: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia. Present: Mr.Nitin Kumar, Advocate, for the petitioner. Mr. Mehardeep Singh, AAG, Punjab. K.S. Ahluwalia, J. (Oral) The instant criminal revision has been filed by Kesar Singh son of Hari Singh, resident of Kartar Pur, District Ropar. The prosecution case is that on 9-5-1993 at about 11-00 a.m. in the area of bus stand Katani Kalan, the petitioner was driving Bus No. CH-01G-5061 and due to his rash and negligent driving, while attempting to overtake a tempo, it ran over the same and hit an electric pole and thereafter ran over one Maghi Ram, who was standing on left side of the road, as a result of which the latter died. The petitioner was convicted by the Judicial Magistrate st Class, Ludhiana and sentenced to RI for one year under Section -A IPC and a fine of Rs. 2,000/- and six months' RI under Section IPC. It was further ordered that non-payment of fine will entail him with three months' RI. All the sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The petitioner filed appeal, which was also dismissed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Ludhiana. Hence he has come up in the present revision petition. Sh. Nitin Kumar appearing for the petitioner has very fairly stated that since the witnesses have been believed by both the Courts below and they have returned the findings of fact, it would be difficult for him to dislodge the testimony of the witnesses before a revisional court. Criminal Revision No. 407 of 1998 (2) Making an alternative prayer for reduction of sentence, Mr. Nitin Kumar submits that the occurrence took place in May 1993. A period of 15 years has elapsed. The petitioner has suffered a protracted trial. He was taken into custody on 18-4-1998 and was enlarged on bail on 20-5-1998 i.e. he has undergone one month and two days. Taking into consideration the totality of circumstances, I find no justification in sending the petitioner behind bars once again after 15 years. The sentence awarded by the trial Court is reduced to the period already undergone by the petitioner, subject to payment of fine of Rs.25,000/-, which ( if realised) shall be disbursed to the legal heirs of deceased Maghi Ram. The amount of fine shall be deposited before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ludhiana within three months from today. In case of failure to deposit the amount of fine, the present revision shall be deemed to have been dismissed and the petitioner shall undergo the remnant sentence, as awarded by the trial Court. With the aforesaid modification in the sentence, the revision petition stands disposed of.",

(ORAL). C.M. No. 3517 of 2009. Counsel for the parties state that the main writ petition may be heard and decided. With the consent of counsel for the parties, the main case is taken up for final disposal.\n\nAn award dated 25.04.1994 (Annexure-P-16), came to be passed in favour of the respondent No. 2-workman, holding him entitled to reinstatement in service with continuity of service and full back wages. The said award was challenged by the petitioner-management before this Court through the present writ petition but as no stay was granted, the respondent No. 2-workman was taken back in service, vide order dated 24.09.1994. The workman continued with his service and during the pendency of the writ petition, vide order dated 19.05.2004, the services of the respondent No. 2- workman have been regularised w.e.f. 01.10.2003, as per the Government policy. In this view of the matter, the question with regard to reinstatement in service of the respondent No.2-workman have been rendered infructuous. However, counsel for the petitioner-management contends that full back wages should have been granted to the respondent No.2-workman from the date of his retrenchment as the same was held not in consonance with the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent No. 2-workman submits that since the provisions as contained in Section 25-N of the Industrial Disputes Act have not been complied with, therefore, the respondent No.2-workman is held entitled to reinstatement in service and has been rightly granted by the Labour Court. I have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. It is a matter of fact which is admitted that the respondent No. 2-workman was retrenched from service. The provisions as contained in Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act were complied with but since the provisions as contained in Section 25-N of the Industrial Disputes Act were applicable to the petitioner, the same having not been complied with, the retrenchment of the respondent No. 2-workman was not in consonance with the Industrial Disputes Act. In these peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable that full back wages which have been granted to the respondent No. 2-workman by the Labour -2- Court, vide its impugned award dated 25.04.1994 (Annexure-P-16), be modified to read as 50% back wages from the date of his retrenchment till the date of his reinstatement. It would not be out of way to mention here that since the services of the respondent No. 2-workman have been regularised, the question of reinstatement of respondent No. 2-workman is no more in question which would require adjudication by this Court. It is made clear that due to the passing of present order, the services of the respondent No. 2-workman will not be affected in any way. The writ petition stands disposed of in above terms.\n\n(AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH) JUDGE April 16, 2009. sjks.\n\nWhether referred to the Reporter Yes/No. -3-",

After the marriage Santokh Singh complainant along with his wife Balwinder Kaur, sister Darshan Kaur, father's sister's sons Mantej Singh Balbir Singh, father's sister Saro, Resham Kaur, Baldevia Majail Singh and Dalbir Kaur, was returning on tractor trolley No. PB-07A-2713 towards village Mehmandowal which was being driven by the complainant. Mantej Singh was sitting on the mud- guard of the aforesaid tractor whereas the aforesaid remaining persons were sitting in the trolley. On 18.11.93 at about 9.30 a.m., when they reached a little ahead of village Dohlron, a Punjab Roadways bus No. PJG-3758 driven by Surjit Singh accused came from their behind. It was driven rashly and negligently and without blowing any horn, the left side of the bus struck against the trolley of the tractor as a result of which tractor- trolley turned around due to the impact. Dalbir Kaur fell down from the tractor trolley on the metalled road and received injuries and died at the spot. Balwinder Kaur, Mantej Singh and the complainant also received some injuries. Surjit Singh accused caused the accident by rash and negligent driving the aforesaid bus. On the statement of Santokh Singh, FIR was registered against the accused. The investigation was conducted by ASI Dev Raj, who prepared inquest report on the dead body of Dalbir Kaur and got its autopsy conducted from Dr.G.P.S. Bedi. He also prepared rough site plan of the place of accident, recorded the statements of the witnesses. He took into possession the tractor- trolley and the bus involved in the accident from the spot. The accused was arrested and after completion of necessary investigation formalities, challan against the accused was presented. .On presentation of the challan, copies of the documents were supplied to the accused free of cost as required under Section 207 Cr.P.C. After hearing the learned defence counsel and from the perusal of the documents, a prima facie case to frame charge under Sections 279 and 304-A of IPC against the accused was made out. Accordingly, charge was framed against the accused by the learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Hoshiarpur to which the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Learned counsel for the petitioner, during the course of arguments, has not challenged the conviction of the petitioner under Section and 304 IPC but has submitted that the sentence qua imprisonment be reduced to already undergone by the petitioner as the incident relates to the year 1993 and the petitioner has already suffered agony of trial for so many years Accordingly, keeping in view the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner, it is a fit case where the sentence qua imprisonment under Section 304-A IPC is liable to be reduced . Hence, the conviction of the petitioner under Sections 279 and 304-A IPC is maintained. However, the sentence qua the imprisonment of the petitioner under Section 304-A IPC is reduced from rigorous imprisonment for one year and six months to rigorous imprisonment for one year and the fine is enhanced from Rs.500/- to Rs.5000/- and in default of it, the petitioner shall further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one month. Petition stands disposed of accordingly. (Sabina) Judge January 28, 2010 arya",

Mr. Sudhir Sharma, Advocate for the complainant. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. In the present case accused had fired shot from a country- made pistol, which had hit knee of Balwan. The accused made a disclosure statement and got recovered the country-made pistol. Amar Singh appeared as PW-2 and supported the version given by ASI Dharamvir PW-3. In pursuance of the disclosure statement made, pistol Ex.P1 and empties Ex.P2 to P4 were recovered on 8th March, 1995. The trial Court had convicted the appellant for offence under Section 25 of the Arms Act and had sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years. It was further ordered that the sentence shall run concurrent with the sentence awarded to the accused under Section 307 IPC. This Court had separately decided Criminal Appeal No.554- SB of 1997, wherein it was held that accused had fired shot at Balwan and had caused an injury which fall under Section 308 IPC and has Criminal Appeal No.557-SB of 1997 sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years. The testimony of Amar Singh PW-2 and ASI Dharamvir PW-3 has been relied in the case under Section 308 IPC, where Amar Singh had appeared as PW-12 and ASI Dharamvir had appeared as PW-15. Therefore, once recovery of weapon in pursuance of disclosure statement has been proved and it has been held by the Court that fire arm was used to cause injury, there is no justification to substitute the well reasoned judgment of the trial Court. However, as the trial Court had stated that the sentence awarded under Section 25 of the Arms Act shall run concurrent with the sentence awarded under Section 307 IPC, this Court acting as an appellate Court also affirms this finding and orders that sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment awarded to the appellant under Section 25 of the Arms Act shall run concurrent with the sentence of three years rigorous imprisonment awarded to him under Section 308 IPC.

To be referred to the Reporters or not ? . Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? -.- K. KANNAN J.(ORAL) . The challenge to the award of the Labour Court at the instance of the management namely Punjab State Tubewell Corporation Ltd. is made on two counts: One, the purported reference that had been made was without notice and therefore, the reference to the Labour Court was vitiated. Two, the workman had been terminated from service on account of his being rendered surplus and being a junior most in the cadre that he belonged, he was required to be retrenched and notice of retrenchment was duly issued under Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act and compensation was also paid to him which he had received. There had been a perfect statutory compliance and therefore, the award of the Labour Court finding the termination to be illegal was unjustified. The management, therefore, seeks for quashing of order. -2- . Learned counsel appearing for the workman submits that he had been appointed on work-charged basis for projects undertaken at various divisions as a Mate on 01.02.1978 and later was promoted and posted as Work Mistry on 01.10.1979. He had continued his services in such a post till the management passed order dated 04.05.1988. He had been ordered to be reverted from his designated post as Work Mistry to lower rank Chowkidar (Mate). Within five days, on 10.05.1988, a notice of retrenchment had been served and on 06.06.1988, the retrenchment compensation had been given and received by the workman. . The challenge to retrenchment came immediately thereafter when a demand notice had been issued on 29.06.1998 and the proceedings were before the Labour Court on a reference from the Government. . On the objection that the reference itself was bad, the Labour Court had considered the fact that there was nothing on record to show conclusively that the management had not been heard before a reference was finally made to the Court. It reasoned that in the absence of best evidence in the form of record of the Labour Commissioner, Punjab, it should be taken that the management withheld from the Court vital evidences for the reasons best known to it and held the issue against the management. I am not persuaded to take any different view on the legality of the reference itself. . While considering the issue whether the retrenchment was valid or not, the Labour Court had considered the fact that even the order of reversion purported to have been made on 04.05.1988, had been made without any prior notice and even before the ink dried in the office -3- order, notice of termination was issued. The Labour Court had referred to the fact that the workman had stated on oath that notice of retrenchment was given on the same day when he was also informed that he had been reverted. In matter of public employment, it is inconceivable that even if there was a decision for reversion, it could be made without following the elementary principles of natural justice of serving notice on the workman to show cause against reversion. The reversion was just not a change in designation but it had serious consequences of lower scale of pay. Again reversion cannot be a matter of mere administrative exigency with no formulation about how it could be done without any reference to seniority. All that, we find from the order of reversion on 04.05.1988 was that he was senior in the lower category from which he was promoted. Actually, the juniormost amongst the higher post alone could have been reverted and the reference must have been made with reference to his rank being the junior most from the post from which he was being reverted. Again the order of reversion refers to two other persons Balu Ram and Gurdev Singh also as having been reverted on the same day. . The Labour Court has found that even amongst the persons, who had been retained in the service after the so-called reversion, there were persons who were lower in the order of seniority such as Piara Lal s/o Gurditta Ram (Sr. No.50) and several other persons who had been shown lower in the ranks as Chowkidars and they had been still in service. Learned counsel appearing for the Corporation would find fault with the reasoning adopted by the Labour Court by pointing out that the persons who had been retained in service had been inducted as Chowkidars and the workman was a Mate who belonged to a different -4- category. Even in the order of reversion, the reference to the designation of the workman is stated to be only Chowkidar and the expression Mate is stated in parenthesis. Even in the seniority list, which had been produced before the Labour Court, it is said to be only an extract of the seniority of Chowkidars and the extension which was sought to be given, was wrongly done. If only there was an official gradation that existed that a Mate could not be accommodated as a Chowkidar, there was no reason why a person who is senior amongst the workmen that were in the same Class IV category should be jettisoned and persons who were juniors to him should be retained in service. There was not even any evidence that there was any rational classification amongst the various categories of workmen amongst Class IV category. With no evidence coming from the management to explain with reference to the Service Rules making differentiation in the classes of workers amongst the same category, the Labour Court was justified in finding the reversion and the retrenchment to be illegal. . The Labour Court has considered what was relevant and has passed the order directing reinstatement of the workman as Chowkidar with continuity of service and back wages. I affirm the decision and dismiss the writ petition. No costs. (K. KANNAN) JUDGE July 15, 2009 Pankaj*",

    "court": "In the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh Date of decision: 1.9.2008 Labha and another ......Appellants Versus State of Punjab .......Respondent CORAM: HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE JASBIR SINGH HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE SABINA Present: Ms.G.K.Mann, Advocate, for the appellants. Mr.Rajesh Bhardwaj, DAG, Punjab. **** JUDGMENT SABINA, J. Labha and Kuldip Singh @ Keepa have filed this appeal challenging their conviction and sentence under Section 302/34/450 IPC vide impugned judgment dated 11.9.1998 passed by Sessions Judge, Amrisar. Prosecution story, in brief, is that on 24.7.1996 the complainant took his dinner along with his father Jiwan Dass, younger brother Surinder Kumar and cousin brother Rajinder Mohan. Thereafter, the complainant along with Surinder Kumar and Rajinder Mohan slept on the cots on the roof of the rooms, whereas, Jiwan Dass slept on a cot on the roof of the varandah, opposite to them. An electric bulb was on in the courtyard. About 10.30/11.00 p.m. complainant woke up on hearing alram raised by his father and saw that Labha armed with datar was giving blows on the face of his father while he was sleeping. Kuldip Singh @ Keepa was empty handed and had held Jiwan Dass from his legs. Complainant raised hue and cry which woke up Surinder Kumar and Rajinder Mohan. Labha gave 4-5 datar blows on the face of Jiwan Dass. When they raised alarm accused fled away from the spot with their weapon. Motive behind occurrence is that accused used to purchase goods from their shop on credit and they had been abused by Jiwan Dass on account of some payment. Due to this reason they had murdered him in connivance with each other. Out of fear and trauma, complainant did not report the matter to the police during night. The matter was reported to the police in the morning and statement of complainant was recorded at about 9.00 a.m. on 25.7.1996. On the basis of the statement of the complainant formal FIR No. 116 dated .7.1996 was registered by the police of police station Lopoke. Inspector Gurbhinder Singh visited the spot along with the complainant. The dead body of Jiwan Dass was recovered from the cot on the roof of the veranda. He prepared inquest report with regard to the recovered dead body and lifted blood stained earth from the spot and recorded statements of the witnesses. Rough site plan was prepared and the dead body was sent for post mortem examination. Dr. Ashok Chanana conducted the post mortem examination on the dead body of Jiwan Dass on 26.7.1996 at about .00 a.m. and found following injuries on the person of the deceased:- . A horizontal incised wound 6 x 1.5 cm with clotted blood was present on the front of the nose in its middle. The nose was divided into two portions. Clotted blood was present at the site. . A horizontal incised wound 7 x 1.4 cm with clotted blood was present on the face, 3 cm below injury No.1. . An incised wound 1.6 x 2 cm was present from the right cheek upto the left ear. It passed through the upper lip. Clotted blood was present at the site. The mouth contained 50 ml. of fluid and clotted blood. . An incised wound obliquely placed 7x 1.4 cm with clotted blood was present on the left mandibular region. The underlying mandible was fractured. Clotted blood was present at the site. . An incised wound obliquely placed 3 x 1.2 cm with clotted blood was present on the back of left middle finger. He further opined that injuries were ante mortem in nature and cause of death was shock as a result of cumulative effect of injuries which were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The time between injuries and death was rapid and between death and postmortem examination was about 24 to 36 hours. Accused were arrested on 2.8.1996. During interrogation of accused Labha on 4.8.1996 blood stained datar was got recovered on the basis of his disclosure statement. After completion of investigation and necessary formalities accused were sent up for trial. Charge was framed against them under Section 302/34 and IPC on 30.4.1997 to which they did not plead guilty and claimed trial. At the trial, prosecution in order to prove its case examined Dr.Ashok Chanana (PW-1), Narinder Kumar (PW-2), Rajinder Mohan (PW-3) and Gurbhinder Singh ( PW-4). After the close of prosecution evidence accused, when examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C., prayed that they were innocent and have been falsely involved in this case. Learned trial Judge, Amritsar believed the prosecution version and held the accused guilty of the charge framed against them. Accused Labha was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.1,000/- under Section 302 IPC and rigorous imprisonment for three years with fine of Rs.500/- under Section 450 IPC. Accused Kuldip Singh @ Keepa was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.1,000/- under Section 302/34 IPC and rigorous imprisonment for three years with fine of Rs.500/- under Section 450 IPC. Hence, the present appeal. In appeal, it has been argued that it was a case of blind murder and the appellants had been falsely involved in this case. The presence of five witnesses at the spot was doubtful. There was inordinate delay in lodging the FIR, which made the prosecution case untrustworthy. The names of the eye witnesses were not mentioned in the inquest report nor the weapon used was described therein. Learned State counsel, on the other hand, has submitted that the presence of the complainant could not be doubted at the spot being son of the deceased. The presence of the remaining witnesses can also not be doubted at the spot. There was no unexplained delay in lodging the FIR. Present case rests on an eye witness account. Complainant is the son of the deceased and his presence in the house i.e. place of occurrence cannot be doubted. Rajinder Mohan (PW-3) is the cousin brother of the complainant and his presence at the spot also cannot be doubted. Complainant, while appearing in witness box as PW-2, has deposed as per his statement in the FIR, which is duly corroborated by Rajinder Mohan (PW-3). Complainant woke up on hearing alarm raised by his father, whereas, Rajinder Mohan (PW-3) woke up on alarm raised by the complainant. Both the said witnesses witnessed the occurrence. The occurrence had allegedly taken place at about 10.30/11.00 a.m. and the matter was reported to the police in the morning. As per the Investigating Officer, the complainant had met him at about 7.30 a.m. on .7.1996 and, thereafter, he recorded his statement. After recording of the FIR, the special report was immediately sent to the Magistrate, which was received by him at 11.15 a.m. The complainant must have been in a trauma and panic when he saw his father being murdered. Apparently it took some time for the complainant to report the matter to the police regarding murder of his father. The complainant has explained the delay that out of fear they did not move out anywhere at night and next day he along with Surjit Singh, Sarpanch of the village left to lodge the FIR. At this stage, it would be significant to examine the site plan Exhibit PJ. A perusal of the same reveals that dead body of Jiwan Dass was lying on a cot at Mark 'A' on the veranda, whereas, the complainant and eye witnesses were sleeping on the roof of the rooms opposite the veranda. An electric bulb was on at point 'E' near the place where the complainant and eye witnesses were sleeping. There is another aspect also. The complainant in his cross- examination deposed that roof of the house, where they were sleeping, could be 12 ft. high from the ground, whereas, roof of the house where his father was sleeping might be 9 ft. high. This appears plausible because generally roof of rooms is at a higher level than that of veranda A perusal of the site plan Ex. PJ as well as from the cross-examination of complainant it transpires that the occurrence could be witnessed by the eye witnesses from the place where they were sleeping and immediately it may not have been possible for them to rescue Jiwan Dass. It strengthens the prosecution case that the witnesses were present at the spot and had witnessed the occurrence. The moment all the eye witnesses woke up and raised alarm, accused fled away from the spot. Admittedly, Jiwan Dass was sleeping at the time of occurrence. Injuries have been inflicted by accused Labha with the knife (datar) on the face of the deceased. The ocular version in this regard is duly corroborated by the medical evidence. Since the deceased was sleeping when the occurrence took place, he could not have offerred any resistance at that time and, as such, it was not necessary for any person to have held him from his legs. Rather this would have woken up the deceased before he was attacked. Apparently, the possibility that accused Kuldip Singh @ Keepa has been falsely involved in this case cannot be ruled out. Especially when there was no occasion for him to restrain a sleeping man. His presence at the spot is doubtful. However, so far as accused Labha is concerned, the statements of the witnesses qua his infliction of injuries on the person of the deceased are reliable and inspire confidence. The weapon used by accused Labha was recovered on the basis of his disclosure statement. As per the report of serologist knife was found to be stained with human blood. The fact that the names of the eye witnesses are not mentioned in the inquest report Exhibit PC is not material as Surjit Singh, Ex-Sarpanch and Samma Singh had merely identified the dead body, as per column No.4. It was not necessary for the Investigating Officer to have mentioned the names of all the other persons in the said column. Moreover, the inquest report was prepared after the statement of the complainant was recorded, who had duly named the assailants in his statement. As such, the fact that dead body was not identified by the PWs' is not significant. In column No.12 of the inquest report it had been mentioned that the injuries had been caused with a sharp edged weapon. Merely because this weapon had not been specifically named in the said column does not damage the case of the prosecution which is otherwise duly established from the ocular and medical version qua appellant Labha. Even otherwise it is a settled law that any lapse committed by the Investigating Officer cannot be said to be fatal to the prosecution case if otherwise established. Although complainant has spelt out motive to commit the crime by the accused but in a case of eye witnesses account, motive looses its significance. After going through the entire evidence on record, we are of the opinion that the prosecution has been successful in proving its case against appellant Labha and his conviction and sentence are liable to be upheld. So far as appellant Kuldip Singh @ Keepa is concerned, he is liable to be acquitted by giving him benefit of doubt as possibility of his having been falsely involved in this case cannot be ruled out. Accordingly, this appeal is partly allowed. Appeal qua appellant No.1 Labha is dismissed and his conviction and sentence under Section 302 and 450 IPC is maintained. Appeal qua appellant No.2 Kuldip Singh @ Keepa is allowed and he is acquitted of the charge framed against him. (SABINA)",

JUSTICE MOHINDER PAL. Present: Mr. Amit Aggarwal, Advocate, for Mr. Raghujeet Madan, Advocate, for the appellant. Ms. Sushma Chopra, Additional Advocate General, Haryana.\n\n-.- MOHINDER PAL, J. Rajbir Singh (appellant) was tried by the Additional Sessions Judge, Hisar, for the offences under Sections 363, 366-A and 376 of the Indian Penal Code (for short `the Code') whereas -2- his co-accused Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant) was tried for the offences under Sections 363, 366-A and 506 of the Code. The appellant and Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant) were convicted and sentenced under Section 363 of the Code vide judgment of conviction and the sentence order dated 24.7.1998 passed by the Additional Sessions Judge, Hisar. The appellant was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay fine of Rs.200/-, in default whereof to undergo further simple imprisonment for three months whereas Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant) was awarded the rigorous imprisonment for one and a half years and to pay fine of Rs.200/-, in default whereof to undergo simple imprisonment for three months for the said offence. In this appeal, appellant Rajbir Singh has impugned the said judgment of conviction and the sentence order. The facts of the prosecution case are that the prosecutrix (name withheld) had been kidnapped from her house by Ramesh Kumar (co-accused of the appellant) on 30.9.1996 when she was alone and her parents were not at home. The prosecutrix was reluctant to accompany Ramesh Kumar, but he showed her a knife and extended threats to her. The prosecutrix than accompanied Ramesh Kumar, who took her to Bus Stand of Fatehabad where appellant Rajbir Singh met them. Both the accused then threatened the prosecutrix and made her to sit in a bus bound for Narwana. After reaching Narwana, accused Ramesh Kumar alighted from the bus. Thereafter, appellant Rajbir Singh took the prosecutrix to Gohana to his sister, namely, Smt. -3- Sheela's house. Appellant Rajbir Singh forcibly committed rape upon the prosecutrix at night during her stay in the house of Smt.Sheela at Gohana. On the next day, they went to the Court premises for marriage, but the police rounded them on .10.1996. After presentation of challan in the Court, the accused were put on trial for the offences as stated above. During trial, the prosecution examined as many as thirteen witnesses. In their statements recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, accused-appellant Rajbir Singh and Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant) denied the prosecution allegations and pleaded false implication on account of some altercation which took place between them and the father of the prosecutrix pertaining to some payment. However, no evidence was led by the accused in their defence. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. The prosecutrix, as per school certificate (Exhibit P.E), was born on 25.3.1983 and she had hardly attained the age of thirteen and a half years on the date of commission of the crime, it being 30.9.1996. No doubt, the age mentioned in the School Certificate is not the conclusive proof of age of the prosecutrix, but even after giving the benefit of error of judgment in forming opinion about the age of the prosecutrix, the age of the prosecutrix cannot be said to be more than fifteen -4- years. As noticed above, Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant), had approached the prosecutrix when she was alone in her house. She was escorted to Narwana by both the accused. The presence of the prosecutrix in the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh at Gohana cannot be denied because their presence was noticed in the Court premises and the local police at Gohana had sent a wireless message to Fatehabad police. The prosecutrix in her statement as P.W.9 has given the detailed account of the prosecution case including the manner in which she was enticed away from her house and the manner in which she was made to stay at Gohana in the house of the sister of appellant Rajbir Singh. Manjeet Kaur (P.W.10) is the mother of the prosecutrix and Balbir Singh (P.W.11) is the elder brother of the father of the prosecutrix, who were examined with regard to the age of the prosecutrix. N.C. Wadhwa (P.W.3) had brought the original register of admission and withdrawal of students in the Girls Senior Secondary School, Fatehabad and had produced the certificate (Exhibit P.E) showing the Date of Birth of the prosecutrix as .3.1983. Sub Inspector Partap Singh (P.W.4), who is Investigating Officer of the case, had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix (Exhibit P.G) when she had been recovered from the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh on 3.10.1996. Mr. A.K. Tyagi (P.W.13), who, at the relevant time, was posted as Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Fatehabad, had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 5.10.1996. As would be discussed -5- later on, the prosecutrix was not subjected to rape by appellant Rajbir Singh. Under the circumstances, the evidence furnished by the prosecutrix and the Investigating Officer leaves no room for doubt that the prosecutrix had been kidnapped by the accused from the lawful custody of her parents. The appellant Rajbir Singh has, thus, rightly been convicted and sentenced under Section 363 of the Code. The offence under Section 376 of the Code did not stand proved against the appellant in this case. In her statement (Exhibit P.G) recorded by the police immediately after her recovery from the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh on .10.1996, she did not state about the commission of rape on her by the appellant. She made improvement while making her statement before the Magistrate under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure wherein she stated that she had been raped by the appellant in his sister's house at Gohana. She had made statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate on 5.10.1996 i.e after two days of her recovery from the appellant and by that time she must be under the influence of her parents. The possibility of the prosecutrix being tutored by her parents while deposing before the Magistrate, is clearly evident. Dr. (Ms.) Ramesh Chakravarti (P.W.1), who had medico-legally examined the prosecutrix, did not observe any external marks of injuries on any part of the body of the prosecutrix including thighs and perineum. Besides, no semen was detected by the Forensic Science Laboratory on -6- the articles sent to it for examination. For the aforesaid reasons, the prosecution has been able to prove its case against the appellant under Section 363 of the Code beyond all reasonable doubts. I do not see any ground warranting interference in the impugned judgment of conviction and the sentence order rendered by the learned trial Judge. The same are hereby confirmed. Resultantly, this appeal is dismissed.\n\nJanuary 27, 2010.\n\n( MOHINDER PAL ) ak JUDGE",

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate for the appellant. Ms. Hemlata Balhara, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana for the State. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. Taqdir Singh son of Lehri Singh has preferred the present appeal and has challenged the judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 30th July, 1998, whereby he was held guilty of offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The trial Court had sentenced the appellant under Section 452 IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant was further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1 years under Section 376 IPC. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 of Police Station Sahlawas was present at Jhajjar, when the prosecutrix PW-1 (whose name has been withheld to protect her identity) along with her husband Nahnu Ram PW-5 appeared and made statement Ex.PA, on the basis of which FIR No.32 dated .05.1996 was registered at Police Station Sahlawas. The prosecutrix stated that her parents belong to Dadri Toe. About 11 months before the occurrence, she was married with Nahnu Ram. She was staying in her matrimonial home at village Chandol. She had set up a separate residence with her husband three months before the occurrence and her in-laws were residing in another house. On 3rd May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m. her husband had gone to village Bhakli to do the work of Halwai (sweet maker) in a marriage and she was alone at her house. At about .00 p.m., she went to sleep in the courtyard after bolting the door of her house. She had retired to her bed after taking her meals. At about 11.00 p.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time, the present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had gagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear only. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her mouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied both of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in both the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were broken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide resistance. The accused had broken the string of Salwar of the prosecutrix, removed her panty and forcibly committed sexual intercourse upon her. After the occurrence, the accused untied the hands of the prosecutrix, removed the cloth from her face and ran away from the spot. In the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in- law Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was sent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm to her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house, since the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of the people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant along with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police. She was going to the Police Station to lodge the report when the police officials met her and she got her statement recorded. It was further stated that Taqdir had left his house from the day of incident and was not available. In the present case, occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, at about 11.00 p.m. The prosecutrix had made statement Ex.PA to ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 on 7th May, 1996 at 1.20 p.m. Case was registered at Police Station Sahlawas on 7th May, 1996 at 3.30 p.m. The above said FIR was investigated and report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted against the accused appellant. The case, along with the accused, was committed to the Court of Sessions Judge, Rohtak and was entrusted for trial to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Rohtak. On 19th September, 1996, the trial Judge charged the appellant for offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The charge stated that on 3rd May, 1996 at about 11.00 p.m. in the area of village Chandol, the appellant committed house-trespass by entering the house of the prosecutrix, used as human dwelling, having made preparation to wrongfully restrain the prosecutrix and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 452 IPC.

He denied the same and projected the following version in his statement: Yes. I am innocent. I have been falsely implicated in this case only to save Bansi s/o Sube Singh who is friend and Guru of the husband of the prosecutrix in motor driving, as there was case against him under Section 377 IPC and in charge of P.S. Sahalwas Jagdish Chander was relative of my village and interested in compromise in the case under Section 377 IPC. Both parties were apprehended from the village on the same day but they were sent to home in evening and I was kept in Thana more than 5 and 6 days.

At about 11.00 p.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time, the present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had gagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear only. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her mouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied both of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in both the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were broken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide resistance. The accused had broken the string of Salwar of the prosecutrix, removed her panty and forcibly committed sexual intercourse upon her. After the occurrence, the accused untied the hands of the prosecutrix, removed the cloth from her face and ran away from the spot. In the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in- law Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was sent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm to her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house, since the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of the people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant along with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police. She was going to the Police Station to lodge the report when the police officials met her and she got her statement recorded. It was further stated that Taqdir had left his house from the day of incident and was not available. In the present case, occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, at about 11.00 p.m. The prosecutrix had made statement Ex.PA to ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 on 7th May, 1996 at 1.20 p.m. Case was registered at Police Station Sahlawas on 7th May, 1996 at 3.30 p.m. The above said FIR was investigated and report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted against the accused appellant. The case, along with the accused, was committed to the Court of Sessions Judge, Rohtak and was entrusted for trial to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Rohtak. On 19th September, 1996, the trial Judge charged the appellant for offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The charge stated that on 3rd May, 1996 at about 11.00 p.m. in the area of village Chandol, the appellant committed house-trespass by entering the house of the prosecutrix, used as human dwelling, having made preparation to wrongfully restrain the prosecutrix and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 452 IPC. It was further stated that on the same day, time and place, he had committed offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecutrix appeared as PW-1 and reiterated as to what was stated in her statement Ex.PA, contents of which have been noticed above. She further sated that Taqdir was her neighbour. In cross examination, this witness admitted that her mother had got a case registered against Hari Singh and Smt. Bala wife of Hari Singh on the accusation that Hari Singh had given a kick blow in the stomach of mother of the prosecutrix, due to which she got aborted and the child died. She denied the suggestion that earlier her mother had compromised the matter after acceptance of money. This witness further stated that when the accused appeared near her cot, he was having a 5 feet long Parna (cloth) in his hand. She further stated that the elder brother of her husband was sent to relay the information to her husband. She further deposed that due to breakage of her bangles at the time of incident, she had sustained injuries on her arm s skin but the injuries did not bleed. It was stated that her underwear and Salwar were stained with semen. The police had taken into possession the broken bangles, ring and clothes from the house of prosecutrix. She denied the suggestion that she had lodged false case against the accused to save Bansi son of Sube, a driver and accused in a case under Section 377 IPC. Bansi is stated to be Ustad (teacher) of husband of the prosecutrix as he allegedly used to impart lessons to him in driving. She further stated that it was not in her knowledge that Bansi was named as accused for having committed unnatural intercourse with son of the accused. Head Constable Bharat Singh PW-2, Constable Nafe Singh PW-3 and Constable Krishan Kumar PW-4 tendered their affidavits Ex.PB, PC and PD respectively to prove link evidence. Nahnu Ram, husband of the prosecutrix appeared as PW-5. He stated that on 3rd May, 1996, he had gone to village Bhakli to do the job of Halwai (sweet maker). On 4th May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m., he received the information through his cousin Ram Kishan and came back to his house at 6.30 p.m. He divulged the occurrence to the Sarpanch and other respectables of the village and on their advice that the culprit should be punished, he along with his wife proceeded to the Police Station, when on the way police party met him and his wife got recorded the statement to the police. In cross examination, this witness stated that the broken bangles were put in a match box by a Sub Inspector. He admitted that his father and the father of accused Taqdir were real brothers. Dr.Aruna Sangwan, Medical Officer, Community Health Centre, Jhajjar PW-6 medico legally examined the prosecutrix on 7th May, at 3.45 p.m. No external mark of injury was found, except that there was an old fracture on the right thigh with shortening. In examination of external organs, a whitish discharge was found present in the vagina. Old tags of hymen were present. Vagina admitted two fingers. Vaginal swabs from posterior fornix were taken. Sample of the pubic hair of the prosecutrix was also taken. This witness stated that since the prosecutrix had changed her clothes, they were not taken into possession. This witness had not ruled out the possibility of prosecutrix having sexual intercourse. In cross examination, this witness stated that there was no external mark of injury on the body of the prosecutrix and there was no semen mark on her thigh. SI Jagdish Chander PW-7 had prepared the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. ASI Sumer Singh PW-8 proved registration of the formal FIR Ex.PA/1 on receipt of ruqa Ex.PA. Dr.Ram Kumar, Medical Officer PW-9 had examined the accused appellant and had opined that there was nothing to suggest that the accused was not fit to perform sexual intercourse. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 was the Investigating Officer. He deposed regarding various facets of the investigation. This witness further stated that on 13th May, 1996, he had arrested the accused. This witness stated that when he had inspected the spot, he had not found any broken bangles. This witness admitted that the house of the accused and the door of house of the prosecutrix open in the same street. He stated that the boundary wall between the houses of the accused and that of the prosecutrix was having a height of three feet. Sunil Kumar Bhatnagar, Draftsman PW-11 had prepared the scaled site plan of the spot Ex.PO. Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix was given up as won-over. The Public Prosecutor had placed on record report Ex.PK of the Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban, Haryana, wherein it was stated that human semen was detected on multicoloured terrycot Salwar and on yellow/brown nylon underwear. Thereafter, prosecution closed its evidence. Statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating circumstances were put to him. He denied the same and projected the following version in his statement: Yes. I am innocent. I have been falsely implicated in this case only to save Bansi s/o Sube Singh who is friend and Guru of the husband of the prosecutrix in motor driving, as there was case against him under Section 377 IPC and in charge of P.S. Sahalwas Jagdish Chander was relative of my village and interested in compromise in the case under Section 377 IPC. Both parties were apprehended from the village on the same day but they were sent to home in evening and I was kept in Thana more than 5 and 6 days. In defence, Jagminder Singh Draftsman was examined as DW-1. He proved the site plan Ex.D1. This witness stated that the door of the house of accused faces the street towards the Northern side of his house. Thereafter, there is a small turning at the northern-western corner of the house of accused and thereafter, the street goes to the door of the house of prosecutrix. Mauji Ram DW-2 stated that as a Sarpanch, he had not heard of any incident. This witness stated that it was not in his knowledge that the accused and cousin of Nahnu Ram were challaned under Section /151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had only heard about a family dispute. Het Ram DW-3 stated that he had learnt that Taqdir had been challaned under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had heard nothing about the accused. In cross examination, this witness stated that there was no case registered against the accused under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. Sabha Chand Chaukidar DW-4 stated that the circumstances regarding arrest of the accused were not in his knowledge. I have heard counsel for the parties. Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate appearing for the appellant, has stated that the prosecutrix was aged about 19-20 years. It is further submitted that at the time of incident, prosecutrix was 21 weeks pregnant. It is submitted that according to the prosecution story, accused came to the house of the prosecutrix at 11.00 p.m. He had tied the hands of the prosecutrix with a cloth and had allegedly gagged her mouth with the cloth. It is contended that according to the prosecutrix, the accused while leaving, had untied her hands and had removed the cloth from her mouth, still the prosecutrix had raised no noise to attract anybody and narrate the incident. These circumstances according to the counsel, make the version projected by the prosecutrix unnatural, improbable and unconvincing. It is urged that this Court should appreciate the arguments in light of the fact that for four days, the prosecutrix had not reported the matter to the police. The occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, 1996, whereas, the report was lodged with the police on 7th May, 1996. Counsel has further stated that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles and ring of little finger were broken at the spot and the same were taken into possession by the Investigating Officer. This fact was also reiterated by Nahna Ram PW-5, husband of the prosecutrix. But ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 had stated in categoric terms that no bangles were taken into possession and the same were not found at the spot. This according to the counsel, is a material contradiction between the testimony of three prime witnesses examined by the prosecution. Furthermore, it was averred that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles had caused injuries on her arms but no such injury was found in the medico legal report, therefore, the medical evidence in no way corroborates the ocular version. It is submitted that vaginal swabs were sent to the laboratory but no semen was found. There were no external or internal marks of injury suffered by the prosecutrix. It is further submitted that Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, to whom the occurrence was narrated for the first time, was not examined by the prosecution. Even brother of husband of the prosecutrix, who had relayed the information to Nahnu Ram, husband of the prosecutrix, at the place of his avocation, was not examined. Adding force to the above stated arguments, it is urged that the suggestions given by the accused and the version narrated by him in his statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. assumes importance, as present and the former Sarpanch of the village had appeared in defence as DW-2 and DW-3 respectively and stated that no occurrence had taken place. This according to the counsel, belies the explanation furnished by the prosecutrix to explain the delay that the villagers had prompted her to lodge the report so that the culprit should be punished. Counsel for the State has urged that the testimony of prosecutrix aspires confidence and can be relied upon without any corroboration. There are certain features of this case, which compel this Court to arrive at a conclusion that the testimony of the prosecutrix can be relied upon without any corroboration: (a) Father of the accused and the father of husband of the prosecutrix were brothers, therefore, the accused and husband of the prosecutrix are closely related. (b) On the day of occurrence, in connection with his avocation, husband of the prosecutrix had gone out of the village and the prosecutrix was alone at her house when in the night accused had trespassed into her house. (c) The version projected regarding the alleged inimical relations has not been proved by the defence. No copy of the FIR, report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. or the Court proceedings has been placed on record to prove that the alleged friend (Ustad) of husband of the prosecutrix was involved in a case under Section 377 Cr.P.C. Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that the prosecutrix and her husband will level false allegations of rape to absolve a friend of the husband, especially when the accused is closely related to them. Thus, except a bald suggestion and a version under Section Cr.P.C., nothing has been brought on record to corroborate the same. The suggestion propounded by the defence and the version given under Section 313 Cr.P.C. are to be rejected, being not probable. Once this Court has held that the relations between the parties were normal, then it is difficult to believe that the prosecutrix will put reputation of her family at stake by leveling false allegations. (d) It is not the case of the accused that it is a case of consent. The arguments raised by the defence counsel that there was a delay of four days in lodging the report to the police; no injury on the person of the prosecutrix was found in the medical evidence, therefore, she had not offered any resistance; the bangles were not recovered and that the defence witnesses have belied the version of the prosecutrix, are to be rejected in the context of circumstances enumerated above. The Hon ble Apex Court, in State of Maharasthra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550, observed as under: 15. It is necessary at the outset to state what the approach of the court should be while evaluating the prosecution evidence, particularly the evidence of the prosecutrix, in sex offences. Is it essential that the evidence of the prosecutrix should be corroborated in material particulars before the court bases a conviction on her testimony ? Does the rule of prudence demand that in all cases save the rarest of rare the court should look for corroboration before acting on the evidence of the prosecutrix ? Let us see if the Evidence Act provides the clue. Under the said statute Evidence means and includes all statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to the matters of fact under inquiry. Under Section 59 all facts, except the contents of documents, may be proved by oral evidence. Section 118 then tells us who may give oral evidence. According to that section all persons are competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rational answers to those questions, by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind. Even in the case of an accomplice Section provides that he shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. However, illustration (b) to Section 114, which lays down a rule of practice, says that the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is corroborated in material particulars. Thus under Section 133, which lays down a rule of law, an accomplice is a competent witness and a conviction based solely on his uncorroborated evidence is not illegal although in view of Section 114, illustration (b), courts do not as a matter of practice do so and look for corroboration in material particulars. This is the conjoint effect of Sections 133 and 114, illustration (b). . A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to illustration (b) to Section 114 which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no doubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix who does not lack understanding must be accepted. The degree of proof required must not be higher than is expected of an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that exception has rightly been taken to the approach of the High Court as is reflected in the following passage: It is only in the rarest of rare cases if the court finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is so trustworthy, truthful and reliable that other corroboration may not be necessary. With respect, the law is not correctly stated. If we may say so, it is just the reverse. Ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an injured person who is a victim of violence, unless there are special circumstances which call for greater caution, in which case it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is independent evidence lending assurance to her accusation. . We think it proper, having regard to the increase in the number of sex violation cases in the recent past, particularly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to remove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman who is a victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be corroborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare cases. To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare cases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust of another with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult womanhood. It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman that her story of woe will not be believed unless it is corroborated in material particulars as in the case of an accomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where it concerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society as in some of the western and European countries. Our standard of decency and morality in public life is not the same as in those countries. It is, however, unfortunate that respect for womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases of molestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman is now required to suffer indignities in different forms, from lewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape. Decency and morality in public life can be promoted and protected only if we deal strictly with those who violate the societal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the court in such cases must take into account the fact that such crimes are generally committed on the sly and very rarely direct evidence of a person other than the prosecutrix is available. Courts must also realise that ordinarily a woman, more so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling a false charge concerning her chastity. In the light of the observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court above, this Court cannot ignore that on the Salwar and underwear of the prosecutrix, human semen was detected. It is not necessary that in every case, vaginal swabs must contain semen. Sometimes the accused may discharge the semen outside the vagina. No question to this effect was asked to the prosecutrix. Furthermore, it was stated by the prosecutrix that her hands were tied and her legs were weak, therefore, she could not offer resistance to the accused, who was a well built young man. Non- examination of Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, and elder brother (cousin) (Jeth) of husband of the prosecutrix, is also of no consequence as the testimony of the prosecutrix corroborated by her husband is sufficient for reliance, as the same aspires confidence. In Gita Ram v. State of H.P. 2002 Cri.L.J.3832, Himachal Pradesh High Court has held that the delay in lodging of the report is of no consequence as victim of sexual assault face a lot of difficulty to come forward to depose against the accused, as the reputation of family of the prosecutrix is at stake. Relying upon the judgment rendered in State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh (1996) 2 SCC 384, Himachal Pradesh High Court observed as under: 22. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh , (1996) 2 SCC : (1996 Cri LJ 1728), their Lordships took note of the existing rate of crime against women and held : (SCC p 403, para 21) : (at Pp 1739-40, Para 20 of Cri LJ). 21. Of late, crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the society towards the violation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must remember that a rapist not only violate the victim's privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female. The Courts, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If for some reason the Court finds it different to place implicit reliance on her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the trial Court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations. Referring to an earlier judgment in State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550 : (1990 Cri LJ 889), the Supreme Court in Gurmit Singh case (1996 (2) SCC 384 : 1996 Cri LJ 1728) held : (SCC Pp 395- , paras 8-9) : (at p 1735, Para 7 of Cri LJ). The Courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self respecting woman would come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. The inherent bashfulness of the females and the tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are factors which the Courts should not overlook. The testimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the Courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion ? The Court while appreciating the evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is a witness who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to insist upon corroboration of her statement to base conviction of an accused. The evidence of a victim of sexual assault stands almost on a par with the evidence of a injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable. Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which is not found to be self inflicted, as considered to be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield the real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding. Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. It must not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person s lust and it is improper and undesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount of suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice. Interference have to be drawn from a given set of facts and circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead uniformity lest that type of rigidity in the shape of rule of law is introduced through a new form of testimonial tyranny making justice a casualty. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even, if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as deprobable. In State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990 (1) SCC 550 : 1990 Cri LJ 889), Ahmadi, J. (as the Lord Chief Justice then was) speaking for the Bench summarised the position in the following words : (SCC p 559, para 16 : (at Pp 894-95, Para 16 of Cri LJ). A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on a par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care of and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to Illustration (b) to Section 114 which required it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the Court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the Court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the Court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We are in respectful agreement with the above exposition of law. In the instant case our careful analysis of the statement of the prosecutrix has created an impression on our minds that she is a reliable and truthful witness. Her testimony suffers from no infirmity or blemish whatsoever. We have no hesitation in acting upon her testimony alone without looking for any corroboration. However, in this case there is ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix. . In the light of the above said ratio of the decision of the Apex Court, I find that in the case on hand the testimony of the prosecutrix discussed hereinabove suffers from no infirmity and she is a reliable and truthful witness. There is ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix in the form of the deposition of PW 2 to whom the prosecutrix had narrated the incident in the evening on the same day and she disclosed the occurrence to her husband immediately after he returned from attending the fair. Medical evidence is not of much relevance for the reason that prosecutrix was examined by Dr. Shyam after about 24 days from the alleged day of occurrence and further because she is a married woman and was habitual of sexual inter course. In the present case, the prosecutrix was medico legally examined after four days of the occurrence. In Karnel Singh v. State of M.P. 1995(3) RCR (Criminal) , it was observed as under: 7. The submission overlooks the fact that in India women are slow and hesitant to complain of such assaults and if the prosecutrix happens to be a married person she will not do anything without informing her husband. Merely because the complaint was lodged less than promptly does not raise the inference that the complaint was false. The reluctance to go to the police is because of society s attitude towards such women; it casts doubt and shame upon her rather than comfort and sympathize with her. Therefore, delay in lodging complaints in such cases does not necessarily indicate that her version is false. In view of the observations of the Hon ble Apex Court, it is necessary to notice the judgments relied by the counsel for the appellant. Reliance has been placed upon Tameezuddin @ Tammu v. State of (NCT) of Delhi 2009(4) RCR (Criminal) 345. A perusal of the said judgment reveals that the same is not attracted on the facts of the present case. Their Lordships of Hon ble Apex Court took into consideration the testimony of PW-1 prosecutrix where she told the appellant that everything was forgiven and forgotten. Another judgment relied by the counsel for the appellant rendered in State of Haryana v. Dilawar 2009(3) RCR (Criminal) 2001 is also not attracted, as the Court has given credence to the fact that Zile Singh PW-6 in that case had not supported the prosecution. Similarly Kishan v. State of Haryana 2009(3) RCR (Criminal) 480, a judgment rendered by a Single Bench of this Court is also not attracted on the facts of the present case, as it was held that the evidence of the prosecutrix was neither reliable nor trustworthy. It was further held that each case depends on its own facts and circumstances. Another judgment cited by counsel for the appellant, rendered by a Division Bench of Hon ble Apex Court in Pandurang Sitaram Bhagwat v. State of Maharashtra 2005(1) RCR (Criminal) 858 also states that each case is to be determined on the factual matrix of that case. This Court has already held that testimony of the prosecutrix aspires confidence, therefore, in view of the discussion made above and the observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court in the judgments relied, this Court is of the opinion that present appeal is devoid of any merit and is thus, liable to be dismissed. Counsel for the appellant has relied upon another judgment of this Court rendered in Balkar Singh v. State of Haryana 2007(4) RCR (Criminal) 597 to contend that taking into consideration long pendency of the trial, sentence awarded upon the appellant should be reduced to the minimum period prescribed. This Court is of the view that there are no special or adequate reasons to reduce the sentence awarded upon the accused appellant. It is not a case where the accused and the prosecutrix had eloped together. It is also not a case of love affair, where because the age of the prosecutrix was less therefore, the sentence should be reduced. In the present case, the appellant had committed offence of rape to satisfy his lust, therefore, there is no scope for reduction in sentence awarded to the accused appellant. Hence, this prayer is also declined. Dismissed. [KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA] JUDGE February 23, 2010 rps",

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate for the appellant. Ms. Hemlata Balhara, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana for the State. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. Taqdir Singh son of Lehri Singh has preferred the present appeal and has challenged the judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 30th July, 1998, whereby he was held guilty of offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The trial Court had sentenced the appellant under Section 452 IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant was further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1 years under Section 376 IPC. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 of Police Station Sahlawas was present at Jhajjar, when the prosecutrix PW-1 (whose name has been withheld to protect her identity) along with her husband Nahnu Ram PW-5 appeared and made statement Ex.PA, on the basis of which FIR No.32 dated .05.1996 was registered at Police Station Sahlawas. The prosecutrix stated that her parents belong to Dadri Toe. About 11 months before the occurrence, she was married with Nahnu Ram. She was staying in her matrimonial home at village Chandol. She had set up a separate residence with her husband three months before the occurrence and her in-laws were residing in another house. On 3rd May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m. her husband had gone to village Bhakli to do the work of Halwai (sweet maker) in a marriage and she was alone at her house. At about .00 p.m., she went to sleep in the courtyard after bolting the door of her house. She had retired to her bed after taking her meals. At about 11.00 p.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time, the present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had gagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear only. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her mouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied both of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in both the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were broken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide resistance. The accused had broken the string of Salwar of the prosecutrix, removed her panty and forcibly committed sexual intercourse upon her. After the occurrence, the accused untied the hands of the prosecutrix, removed the cloth from her face and ran away from the spot. In the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in- law Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was sent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm to her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house, since the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of the people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant along with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police. She was going to the Police Station to lodge the report when the police officials met her and she got her statement recorded. It was further stated that Taqdir had left his house from the day of incident and was not available. In the present case, occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, at about 11.00 p.m. The prosecutrix had made statement Ex.PA to ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 on 7th May, 1996 at 1.20 p.m. Case was registered at Police Station Sahlawas on 7th May, 1996 at 3.30 p.m. The above said FIR was investigated and report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted against the accused appellant. The case, along with the accused, was committed to the Court of Sessions Judge, Rohtak and was entrusted for trial to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Rohtak. On 19th September, 1996, the trial Judge charged the appellant for offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The charge stated that on 3rd May, 1996 at about 11.00 p.m. in the area of village Chandol, the appellant committed house-trespass by entering the house of the prosecutrix, used as human dwelling, having made preparation to wrongfully restrain the prosecutrix and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 452 IPC. It was further stated that on the same day, time and place, he had committed offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecutrix appeared as PW-1 and reiterated as to what was stated in her statement Ex.PA, contents of which have been noticed above. She further sated that Taqdir was her neighbour. In cross examination, this witness admitted that her mother had got a case registered against Hari Singh and Smt. Bala wife of Hari Singh on the accusation that Hari Singh had given a kick blow in the stomach of mother of the prosecutrix, due to which she got aborted and the child died. She denied the suggestion that earlier her mother had compromised the matter after acceptance of money. This witness further stated that when the accused appeared near her cot, he was having a 5 feet long Parna (cloth) in his hand. She further stated that the elder brother of her husband was sent to relay the information to her husband. She further deposed that due to breakage of her bangles at the time of incident, she had sustained injuries on her arm s skin but the injuries did not bleed. It was stated that her underwear and Salwar were stained with semen. The police had taken into possession the broken bangles, ring and clothes from the house of prosecutrix. She denied the suggestion that she had lodged false case against the accused to save Bansi son of Sube, a driver and accused in a case under Section 377 IPC. Bansi is stated to be Ustad (teacher) of husband of the prosecutrix as he allegedly used to impart lessons to him in driving. She further stated that it was not in her knowledge that Bansi was named as accused for having committed unnatural intercourse with son of the accused. Head Constable Bharat Singh PW-2, Constable Nafe Singh PW-3 and Constable Krishan Kumar PW-4 tendered their affidavits Ex.PB, PC and PD respectively to prove link evidence. Nahnu Ram, husband of the prosecutrix appeared as PW-5. He stated that on 3rd May, 1996, he had gone to village Bhakli to do the job of Halwai (sweet maker). On 4th May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m., he received the information through his cousin Ram Kishan and came back to his house at 6.30 p.m. He divulged the occurrence to the Sarpanch and other respectables of the village and on their advice that the culprit should be punished, he along with his wife proceeded to the Police Station, when on the way police party met him and his wife got recorded the statement to the police. In cross examination, this witness stated that the broken bangles were put in a match box by a Sub Inspector. He admitted that his father and the father of accused Taqdir were real brothers. Dr.Aruna Sangwan, Medical Officer, Community Health Centre, Jhajjar PW-6 medico legally examined the prosecutrix on 7th May, at 3.45 p.m. No external mark of injury was found, except that there was an old fracture on the right thigh with shortening. In examination of external organs, a whitish discharge was found present in the vagina. Old tags of hymen were present. Vagina admitted two fingers. Vaginal swabs from posterior fornix were taken. Sample of the pubic hair of the prosecutrix was also taken. This witness stated that since the prosecutrix had changed her clothes, they were not taken into possession. This witness had not ruled out the possibility of prosecutrix having sexual intercourse. In cross examination, this witness stated that there was no external mark of injury on the body of the prosecutrix and there was no semen mark on her thigh. SI Jagdish Chander PW-7 had prepared the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. ASI Sumer Singh PW-8 proved registration of the formal FIR Ex.PA/1 on receipt of ruqa Ex.PA. Dr.Ram Kumar, Medical Officer PW-9 had examined the accused appellant and had opined that there was nothing to suggest that the accused was not fit to perform sexual intercourse. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 was the Investigating Officer. He deposed regarding various facets of the investigation. This witness further stated that on 13th May, 1996, he had arrested the accused. This witness stated that when he had inspected the spot, he had not found any broken bangles. This witness admitted that the house of the accused and the door of house of the prosecutrix open in the same street. He stated that the boundary wall between the houses of the accused and that of the prosecutrix was having a height of three feet. Sunil Kumar Bhatnagar, Draftsman PW-11 had prepared the scaled site plan of the spot Ex.PO. Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix was given up as won-over. The Public Prosecutor had placed on record report Ex.PK of the Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban, Haryana, wherein it was stated that human semen was detected on multicoloured terrycot Salwar and on yellow/brown nylon underwear. Thereafter, prosecution closed its evidence. Statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating circumstances were put to him. He denied the same and projected the following version in his statement: Yes. I am innocent. I have been falsely implicated in this case only to save Bansi s/o Sube Singh who is friend and Guru of the husband of the prosecutrix in motor driving, as there was case against him under Section 377 IPC and in charge of P.S. Sahalwas Jagdish Chander was relative of my village and interested in compromise in the case under Section 377 IPC. Both parties were apprehended from the village on the same day but they were sent to home in evening and I was kept in Thana more than 5 and 6 days. In defence, Jagminder Singh Draftsman was examined as DW-1. He proved the site plan Ex.D1. This witness stated that the door of the house of accused faces the street towards the Northern side of his house. Thereafter, there is a small turning at the northern-western corner of the house of accused and thereafter, the street goes to the door of the house of prosecutrix. Mauji Ram DW-2 stated that as a Sarpanch, he had not heard of any incident. This witness stated that it was not in his knowledge that the accused and cousin of Nahnu Ram were challaned under Section /151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had only heard about a family dispute. Het Ram DW-3 stated that he had learnt that Taqdir had been challaned under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had heard nothing about the accused. In cross examination, this witness stated that there was no case registered against the accused under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. Sabha Chand Chaukidar DW-4 stated that the circumstances regarding arrest of the accused were not in his knowledge. I have heard counsel for the parties. Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate appearing for the appellant, has stated that the prosecutrix was aged about 19-20 years. It is further submitted that at the time of incident, prosecutrix was 21 weeks pregnant. It is submitted that according to the prosecution story, accused came to the house of the prosecutrix at 11.00 p.m. He had tied the hands of the prosecutrix with a cloth and had allegedly gagged her mouth with the cloth. It is contended that according to the prosecutrix, the accused while leaving, had untied her hands and had removed the cloth from her mouth, still the prosecutrix had raised no noise to attract anybody and narrate the incident. These circumstances according to the counsel, make the version projected by the prosecutrix unnatural, improbable and unconvincing. It is urged that this Court should appreciate the arguments in light of the fact that for four days, the prosecutrix had not reported the matter to the police. The occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, 1996, whereas, the report was lodged with the police on 7th May, 1996. Counsel has further stated that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles and ring of little finger were broken at the spot and the same were taken into possession by the Investigating Officer. This fact was also reiterated by Nahna Ram PW-5, husband of the prosecutrix. But ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 had stated in categoric terms that no bangles were taken into possession and the same were not found at the spot. This according to the counsel, is a material contradiction between the testimony of three prime witnesses examined by the prosecution. Furthermore, it was averred that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles had caused injuries on her arms but no such injury was found in the medico legal report, therefore, the medical evidence in no way corroborates the ocular version. It is submitted that vaginal swabs were sent to the laboratory but no semen was found. There were no external or internal marks of injury suffered by the prosecutrix. It is further submitted that Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, to whom the occurrence was narrated for the first time, was not examined by the prosecution. Even brother of husband of the prosecutrix, who had relayed the information to Nahnu Ram, husband of the prosecutrix, at the place of his avocation, was not examined. Adding force to the above stated arguments, it is urged that the suggestions given by the accused and the version narrated by him in his statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. assumes importance, as present and the former Sarpanch of the village had appeared in defence as DW-2 and DW-3 respectively and stated that no occurrence had taken place. This according to the counsel, belies the explanation furnished by the prosecutrix to explain the delay that the villagers had prompted her to lodge the report so that the culprit should be punished. Counsel for the State has urged that the testimony of prosecutrix aspires confidence and can be relied upon without any corroboration. There are certain features of this case, which compel this Court to arrive at a conclusion that the testimony of the prosecutrix can be relied upon without any corroboration: (a) Father of the accused and the father of husband of the prosecutrix were brothers, therefore, the accused and husband of the prosecutrix are closely related. (b) On the day of occurrence, in connection with his avocation, husband of the prosecutrix had gone out of the village and the prosecutrix was alone at her house when in the night accused had trespassed into her house. (c) The version projected regarding the alleged inimical relations has not been proved by the defence. No copy of the FIR, report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. or the Court proceedings has been placed on record to prove that the alleged friend (Ustad) of husband of the prosecutrix was involved in a case under Section 377 Cr.P.C. Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that the prosecutrix and her husband will level false allegations of rape to absolve a friend of the husband, especially when the accused is closely related to them. Thus, except a bald suggestion and a version under Section Cr.P.C., nothing has been brought on record to corroborate the same. The suggestion propounded by the defence and the version given under Section 313 Cr.P.C. are to be rejected, being not probable. Once this Court has held that the relations between the parties were normal, then it is difficult to believe that the prosecutrix will put reputation of her family at stake by leveling false allegations. (d) It is not the case of the accused that it is a case of consent. The arguments raised by the defence counsel that there was a delay of four days in lodging the report to the police; no injury on the person of the prosecutrix was found in the medical evidence, therefore, she had not offered any resistance; the bangles were not recovered and that the defence witnesses have belied the version of the prosecutrix, are to be rejected in the context of circumstances enumerated above. The Hon ble Apex Court, in State of Maharasthra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550, observed as under: 15. It is necessary at the outset to state what the approach of the court should be while evaluating the prosecution evidence, particularly the evidence of the prosecutrix, in sex offences. Is it essential that the evidence of the prosecutrix should be corroborated in material particulars before the court bases a conviction on her testimony ? Does the rule of prudence demand that in all cases save the rarest of rare the court should look for corroboration before acting on the evidence of the prosecutrix ? Let us see if the Evidence Act provides the clue. Under the said statute Evidence means and includes all statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to the matters of fact under inquiry. Under Section 59 all facts, except the contents of documents, may be proved by oral evidence. Section 118 then tells us who may give oral evidence. According to that section all persons are competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rational answers to those questions, by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind. Even in the case of an accomplice Section provides that he shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. However, illustration (b) to Section 114, which lays down a rule of practice, says that the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is corroborated in material particulars. Thus under Section 133, which lays down a rule of law, an accomplice is a competent witness and a conviction based solely on his uncorroborated evidence is not illegal although in view of Section 114, illustration (b), courts do not as a matter of practice do so and look for corroboration in material particulars. This is the conjoint effect of Sections 133 and 114, illustration (b). . A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to illustration (b) to Section 114 which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no doubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix who does not lack understanding must be accepted. The degree of proof required must not be higher than is expected of an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that exception has rightly been taken to the approach of the High Court as is reflected in the following passage: It is only in the rarest of rare cases if the court finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is so trustworthy, truthful and reliable that other corroboration may not be necessary. With respect, the law is not correctly stated. If we may say so, it is just the reverse. Ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an injured person who is a victim of violence, unless there are special circumstances which call for greater caution, in which case it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is independent evidence lending assurance to her accusation. . We think it proper, having regard to the increase in the number of sex violation cases in the recent past, particularly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to remove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman who is a victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be corroborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare cases. To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare cases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust of another with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult womanhood. It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman that her story of woe will not be believed unless it is corroborated in material particulars as in the case of an accomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where it concerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society as in some of the western and European countries. Our standard of decency and morality in public life is not the same as in those countries. It is, however, unfortunate that respect for womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases of molestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman is now required to suffer indignities in different forms, from lewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape. Decency and morality in public life can be promoted and protected only if we deal strictly with those who violate the societal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the court in such cases must take into account the fact that such crimes are generally committed on the sly and very rarely direct evidence of a person other than the prosecutrix is available. Courts must also realise that ordinarily a woman, more so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling a false charge concerning her chastity. In the light of the observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court above, this Court cannot ignore that on the Salwar and underwear of the prosecutrix, human semen was detected. It is not necessary that in every case, vaginal swabs must contain semen. Sometimes the accused may discharge the semen outside the vagina. No question to this effect was asked to the prosecutrix. Furthermore, it was stated by the prosecutrix that her hands were tied and her legs were weak, therefore, she could not offer resistance to the accused, who was a well built young man. Non- examination of Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, and elder brother (cousin) (Jeth) of husband of the prosecutrix, is also of no consequence as the testimony of the prosecutrix corroborated by her husband is sufficient for reliance, as the same aspires confidence. In Gita Ram v. State of H.P. 2002 Cri.L.J.3832, Himachal Pradesh High Court has held that the delay in lodging of the report is of no consequence as victim of sexual assault face a lot of difficulty to come forward to depose against the accused, as the reputation of family of the prosecutrix is at stake. Relying upon the judgment rendered in State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh (1996) 2 SCC 384, Himachal Pradesh High Court observed as under: 22. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh , (1996) 2 SCC : (1996 Cri LJ 1728), their Lordships took note of the existing rate of crime against women and held : (SCC p 403, para 21) : (at Pp 1739-40, Para 20 of Cri LJ). 21. Of late, crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the society towards the violation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must remember that a rapist not only violate the victim's privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female. The Courts, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If for some reason the Court finds it different to place implicit reliance on her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the trial Court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations. Referring to an earlier judgment in State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550 : (1990 Cri LJ 889), the Supreme Court in Gurmit Singh case (1996 (2) SCC 384 : 1996 Cri LJ 1728) held : (SCC Pp 395- , paras 8-9) : (at p 1735, Para 7 of Cri LJ). The Courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self respecting woman would come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. The inherent bashfulness of the females and the tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are factors which the Courts should not overlook. The testimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the Courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion ? The Court while appreciating the evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is a witness who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to insist upon corroboration of her statement to base conviction of an accused. The evidence of a victim of sexual assault stands almost on a par with the evidence of a injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable. Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which is not found to be self inflicted, as considered to be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield the real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding. Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. It must not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person s lust and it is improper and undesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount of suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice. Interference have to be drawn from a given set of facts and circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead uniformity lest that type of rigidity in the shape of rule of law is introduced through a new form of testimonial tyranny making justice a casualty. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even, if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as deprobable. In State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990 (1) SCC 550 : 1990 Cri LJ 889), Ahmadi, J. (as the Lord Chief Justice then was) speaking for the Bench summarised the position in the following words : (SCC p 559, para 16 : (at Pp 894-95, Para 16 of Cri LJ). A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on a par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care of and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to Illustration (b) to Section 114 which required it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the Court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the Court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the Court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We are in respectful agreement with the above exposition of law. In the instant case our careful analysis of the statement of the prosecutrix has created an impression on our minds that she is a reliable and truthful witness. Her testimony suffers from no infirmity or blemish whatsoever. We have no hesitation in acting upon her testimony alone without looking for any corroboration. However, in this case there is ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix. . In the light of the above said ratio of the decision of the Apex Court, I find that in the case on hand the testimony of the prosecutrix discussed hereinabove suffers from no infirmity and she is a reliable and truthful witness. There is ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix in the form of the deposition of PW 2 to whom the prosecutrix had narrated the incident in the evening on the same day and she disclosed the occurrence to her husband immediately after he returned from attending the fair. Medical evidence is not of much relevance for the reason that prosecutrix was examined by Dr. Shyam after about 24 days from the alleged day of occurrence and further because she is a married woman and was habitual of sexual inter course. In the present case, the prosecutrix was medico legally examined after four days of the occurrence. In Karnel Singh v. State of M.P. 1995(3) RCR (Criminal) , it was observed as under: 7. The submission overlooks the fact that in India women are slow and hesitant to complain of such assaults and if the prosecutrix happens to be a married person she will not do anything without informing her husband. Merely because the complaint was lodged less than promptly does not raise the inference that the complaint was false. The reluctance to go to the police is because of society s attitude towards such women; it casts doubt and shame upon her rather than comfort and sympathize with her. Therefore, delay in lodging complaints in such cases does not necessarily indicate that her version is false. In view of the observations of the Hon ble Apex Court, it is necessary to notice the judgments relied by the counsel for the appellant. Reliance has been placed upon Tameezuddin @ Tammu v. State of (NCT) of Delhi 2009(4) RCR (Criminal) 345. A perusal of the said judgment reveals that the same is not attracted on the facts of the present case. Their Lordships of Hon ble Apex Court took into consideration the testimony of PW-1 prosecutrix where she told the appellant that everything was forgiven and forgotten. Another judgment relied by the counsel for the appellant rendered in State of Haryana v. Dilawar 2009(3) RCR (Criminal) 2001 is also not attracted, as the Court has given credence to the fact that Zile Singh PW-6 in that case had not supported the prosecution. Similarly Kishan v. State of Haryana 2009(3) RCR (Criminal) 480, a judgment rendered by a Single Bench of this Court is also not attracted on the facts of the present case, as it was held that the evidence of the prosecutrix was neither reliable nor trustworthy. It was further held that each case depends on its own facts and circumstances. Another judgment cited by counsel for the appellant, rendered by a Division Bench of Hon ble Apex Court in Pandurang Sitaram Bhagwat v. State of Maharashtra 2005(1) RCR (Criminal) 858 also states that each case is to be determined on the factual matrix of that case. This Court has already held that testimony of the prosecutrix aspires confidence, therefore, in view of the discussion made above and the observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court in the judgments relied, this Court is of the opinion that present appeal is devoid of any merit and is thus, liable to be dismissed. Counsel for the appellant has relied upon another judgment of this Court rendered in Balkar Singh v. State of Haryana 2007(4) RCR (Criminal) 597 to contend that taking into consideration long pendency of the trial, sentence awarded upon the appellant should be reduced to the minimum period prescribed. This Court is of the view that there are no special or adequate reasons to reduce the sentence awarded upon the accused appellant. It is not a case where the accused and the prosecutrix had eloped together. It is also not a case of love affair, where because the age of the prosecutrix was less therefore, the sentence should be reduced. In the present case, the appellant had committed offence of rape to satisfy his lust, therefore, there is no scope for reduction in sentence awarded to the accused appellant. Hence, this prayer is also declined. Dismissed. [KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA] JUDGE February 23, 2010 rps",

What is necessary is that the court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. There is ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix in the form of the deposition of PW 2 to whom the prosecutrix had narrated the incident in the evening on the same day and she disclosed the occurrence to her husband immediately after he returned from attending the fair."

    "court": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH Criminal Appeal No. 697-SB of 1998 Date of decision: 23rd March, 2010 Vidya Parshad Tiwari Appellant Versus State of Haryana Respondent CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mr. Harbhagwan Singh, Senior Advocate with Mr. Amit Kumar, Advocate for the appellant. Mr. Manish Deswal, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana for the State. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. Present appeal has been filed by Vidya Parshad Tiwari son of Ram Saran Tiwari. He was named as an accused in case FIR No.729 dated 14.06.1997 registered at Police Station Central Faridabad under Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as, the Act ). The appellant has been convicted by the Court of Special Judge, Faridabad. The appellant was a Depot holder for supplying sugar and kerosene as ration to the beneficiaries under the Public Distribution System. The trial Court came to the conclusion that the accused had failed to maintain the account books properly regarding the months of May and June, 1997. He failed to account for 4 quintals 42 kilograms and 50 grams of sugar and 1005 liters of kerosene pertaining to the quota for the month of May, 1997. The appellant also failed to account for 900 liters of kerosene out of the allotted quota for the month of June, 1997. The appellant had not maintained the sales and stock registers in consonance with the provisions of Clause-9 of the Haryana Prevention of Hoarding and Maintenance of Quality Order, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as, the Quality Order ). Furthermore, it was held that the sale register of sugar for the month of May 1997 contained various blank entries against which signatures of the consumers were appended and thus, he had also violated Clause-6 of the Quality Order. For these violations, the appellant was held guilty of offence under Section 7 of the Act. Having held the appellant guilty, he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year and to pay a fine of Rs.5000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months. It has been submitted that the appellant had deposited the fine. In the present case, FIR was registered on the basis of a written communication sent by J.B. Gondia, District Food and Supplies Controller, Faridabad. It was stated in the FIR that the complainant along with his staff on 13th June, 1997 had conducted the inspection of the premises of Vidya Parshad Tiwari, Depot holder, Rajiv Nagar, Faridabad. The appellant had received 6 quintals of levy sugar from the wholesale godown of CONFED, Faridabad in the month of May 1997 for distribution to the ration-card holders. After inspection of the registers, it came to the light that the Depot holder had misappropriated 4 quintals 42 kilograms and 50 grams of sugar and there were blank entries in the register, which were allegedly signed by the consumers. At the time of inspection, there was no stock in the ration Depot. Furthermore, in the month of May 1997, the Depot holder lifted 2860 liters of kerosene for distribution. The Depot holder had not made any entry regarding the quantity of kerosene distributed to the ration-card holders. According to the register, the Depot holder had shown distribution of kerosene to 265 ration-card holders. If a maximum of 7 liters of kerosene per ration-card holder is taken into consideration, then also the Depot holder could not distribute more than liters of kerosene. In this manner, the Depot holder had misappropriated 1005 liters of kerosene. In the month of June 1997, the Depot holder had lifted 2860 liters of kerosene. No entry was shown in the sale register regarding quantity of the kerosene received and its distribution to the ration-card holders. The Depot holder had shown the distribution of kerosene to 280 ration-card holders. If a maximum of 7 liters of kerosene per ration-card holder is taken into consideration, then the total distribution will come to 1960 liters. In this manner the Depot holder had misappropriated 900 liters of kerosene. These violations gave rise to the presumption that the goods meant for distribution through Public Distribution System were sold at a higher price in the open market. For these alleged irregularities and violation of the Quality Order, Special Judge, Faridabad served notice of accusation upon the appellant on 12th January, 1998. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. J.B. Gondia, District Food and Supplies Controller, Faridabad appeared as PW-1. He reiterated as to what was stated in the complaint Ex.PA, contents of which have been noticed above. In cross examination, this witness stated that no ration-card holder came with any grievance at the spot against the accused. However, the following suggestion was put to this witness: It is wrong to suggest that the accused was ill in those days and in his absence kerosene and sugar were distributed to the card holders by his younger brother who might not have been able to maintain the record properly. I did not verify from the card holders whose names were entered in the registers that he or she had actually not received kerosene or sugar. It is wrong to suggest that the accused has been falsely implicated in this case. A perusal of the above suggestion reveals that the accused was conscious of not maintaining the record. Rishi Pal ASI PW-2 had arrested the appellant on 16th July, . Rurra Ram ASI PW-3 was entrusted with the investigation on th June, 1997. He had recorded the statements of the witnesses and had also prepared the rough site plan Ex.PB. Prosecution has placed on record the Quality Order as Ex.PC. Mr. Harbhagwan Singh, Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant, has extensively referred to the Quality Order Ex.PC. This order defines a Dealer as under: 2.(b) Dealer means a person engaged in the business of sale or storage for sale of any article, whether such business is carried on in retail or in wholesale, and include the distributing agent of the selling agent of such person; Clause 3 of the Quality Order reads as under: 3. The Government may, by notification, in the official Gazette, in respect of any article; (a) the maximum quantity which may, at any one time, be possessed by a dealer or a producer; (b) the maximum quantity which may, at any one time, be possessed by any consumer; (c) the maximum quantity which may, in any one transaction be sold to any person by a dealer or a producer; (d) the quantities fixed in respect of any article under this clause may be different in different localities; Provided that no stock limit shall be fixed in respect of producers regarding sugar, khandsari, gur and shakkar. It will also be apposite here to reproduce Clause 9 of the Quality Order: 9.(1) The physical stock balances of various articles in a fair price shop, authorized and approved by the Government or by any officer authorized by it in this behalf, shall conform to the book balance as per account books maintained by him. (2) All purchases, sales and production made will be correctly accounted for in the account books maintained and shall conform to the actual transaction made. It is contended before me that the Government has issued no notification under sub-clause 1 of Clause 6. It is further submitted that in terms of Clause 3 also, no notification was issued. It has been urged before me that until under Clauses 6 and 9, the State Government had prescribed maximum quantity of any article which may be sold to any consumer or group of consumers, it cannot be held that there was any misappropriation of kerosene or sugar by the appellant. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the submissions made before me. The prosecution may have failed to prove on record the subsequent notification which prescribes maximum quantity of an article which can be issued to a card holder. It is evident that the prevailing practice demands that sale and stock registers ought to have been truthfully filled by the appellant. The appellant is also conscious of this fact. Therefore, a suggestion was given that due to sickness, the appellant may not have filled up the registers and the Depot was managed by his brother Ram Parkash Tiwari. The statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating circumstances were put to him. He denied the same and stated as under: I am innocent. Entries in the registers Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-4 are in the handwriting of my brother Ram Parkash Tiwari, who committed some mistakes. Furthermore, Ram Parkash Tiwari was examined as DW-1, who in examination in chief stated as under: Vidya Parshad accused is my brother. On 11th of April, he had gone to his native village as our mother was ill at that time. He returned around 15th or 16th of June, 1997. In his absence I had looked after the running of his ration depot. I had distributed various articles to the consumers against ration cards. I could not maintain appropriate entries in the account books because of rush and my lack of experience. Thus, it is a case of the accused that the requisite registers were not maintained and they had not depicted the quota received, the sales effected and the stocks available. Consequently, there was a violation of Clause 9 of the Quality Order, which specifically provides that physical stock balance of various articles in a fair-price-shop should conform to the book balance as per the account books maintained by the Dealer. Having held that the appellant had not maintained the registers in consonance with the procedure prescribed, it is difficult for this Court to assume that the stock not available was sold in the open market. Thus, this Court at the most can say that the appellant was remiss in his duty to maintain the necessary registers and account books. The offence under Section 7 of the Act is punishable for a term which should not be less than three months but which may extend upto seven years. Furthermore, all offences under the Act are to be tried in a summary manner under Section 12-A of the Act and the maximum sentence which a Court can award for a summary trial is two years. The inspection, in the present case, was carried in the month of June 1997. The appellant is in corridors of the Courts for the last about years and he has suffered mental pain and agony of a protracted trial. Since this Court has already held that the appellant had failed to maintain the requisite registers and the account books, it would be in the interest of justice in case sentence of the appellant is reduced from one year to three months rigorous imprisonment. With the aforesaid modification in sentence, present appeal is disposed of. [KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA] JUDGE March 23, 2010 rps",

JUSTICE AMOL RATTAN SINGH Present: Mr. Puneet Gupta, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. K.K. Gupta, Addl. Advocate General, Punjab for the respondents-State. *** Amol Rattan Singh, J. . In this petition, the petitioner has sought the benefits of the service rendered by him with the Government of Himachal Pradesh, as a College Lecturer, towards protection of substantive pay, pay fixation and other benefits, including pensionary benefits, for his subsequent service with the Punjab Government. . At the very outset, Sh. Puneet Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, stated that he only presses the case for grant of benefit of the said service in Himachal Pradesh, for pensionary benefits. . The admitted facts of the case are that, the petitioner was appointed as a Lecturer of Economics in the Education Department of -2- Himachal Pradesh on 29.09.1967, in the pay scale of `300-600/-. He was confirmed as such w.e.f. 10.03.1972. . In response to an advertisement issued by the Punjab Public Service Commission, for recruitment to the post of Statistical Officer (PAS Class-I), in the Agriculture Department of the Punjab Government, the petitioner applied through proper channel and his application was forwarded by the Director of the Education Department, Himachal Pradesh to the Secretary, Punjab Public Service Commission, Patiala, vide letter dated 31.08.1973, (annexed as Annexure P-1 with the petition). . Having been duly selected by the Commission, he was appointed as Statistical Officer, in the pay scale of `400-1250/-. Consequent thereupon, the Director of Education, Himachal Pradesh, ordered his relieving on 27.05.1974, with the condition that he would resign his post on the expiry of two years from the date of his relieving, in case he does not join back in the department; that's to say, his lien was retained for a period of two years, in the Department of Education, in Himachal Pradesh. He was actually relieved by the Principal, Government College, Nahan (Himachal Pradesh), on the afternoon of 30.05.1974, on which date he was drawing a substantive pay of `450/-. He joined thereafter, in Punjab. Thereafter, he resigned from Himachal Pradesh, and his resignation was accepted w.e.f. 31.05.1976, vide order dated .10.1976, which is also annexed as Annexure P-3 with the petition. . It is stated by the petitioner, and not denied by the respondents, that upon entering into service in Punjab, he represented to -3- the respondents that his pay at the rate of `450/- be protected, as he was a confirmed employed of the Himachal Pradesh Government and that the same benefit had been granted to one Sh. Sukhdev Singh, who was earlier working with the Himachal Pradesh Government and was subsequently employed by the respondent department, i.e. Directorate of Agriculture, Punjab. . Vide letter dated 13.9.1988, the petitioner was informed that his case for counting temporary service rendered in the Government of Himachal Pradesh, would be considered as soon as he is confirmed in his present post, i.e. the post of Statistical Officer. Though, in the reply, it is stated that his representation was rejected in the year , but it is, at the same time, admitted that it was subsequently decided on 19.04.1988, that his case for counting of previous service would be considered upon his confirmation. . Thereafter, the petitioner was confirmed in the Punjab Agriculture Service, Class-I, on 02.11.1992, upon which he again represented for benefit of previous service. The representation having been rejected in March, 1994, he yet again represented on 04.10.1994 that his case be considered sympathetically, upon which he was again informed on 19.05.1995 that his case had already been rejected earlier. These factual aspects are not denied in the reply filed by the respondents. . The stand taken in the reply filed, is that, since the petitioner had not requested the Punjab Public Service Commission for protection of his pay for pensionary purposes, at the time when he applied for the post of Statistical Officer, Punjab, his case has been -4- rejected. As opposed to this, the case of Sh. Sukhdev Singh, cited by the petitioner, was accepted, in view of the fact that he had made such a representation, along with his application, to the Punjab Public Service Commission, which had accepted the same. Consequently, the Government had implemented the decision of the Punjab Public Service Commission. . Sh. Puneet Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, has drawn my attention to copy of a Memo dated 20.03.1986 (Annexure P- ), issued by the Department of Finance and addressed to all the Heads of Departments in the State of Punjab, duly received by the Director, Agriculture, Punjab, i.e. respondent No.2. The said memo/circular states, in effect, that, after consultations between the Governments of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, it has been decided, on reciprocal basis, that the proportionate pensionary liability in respect of those temporary employees, who had rendered temporary service under either the Punjab or the Himachal Pradesh Governments, prior to obtaining posts under the other State Government, would be shared by such previous government to the extent that such service qualified for pensionary benefits. The said circular is reproduced here, in extenso: Copy of Memo. No.16/98/80-IFP-III/4525, dated: 20.03.1986 from Deputy Secretary Finance(s), Government of Punjab, Department of Finance (Finance Personnel III Branch) addressed to all the Heads of Departments and others. Subject: Allocation of Pensionary liability in respect of temporary service rendered under the Government of Punjab and the Government of Himachal Pradesh. Sir, -5- I am directed to refer to the subject noted above and to say that the Government of Punjab has been considering in consultation with the Government of Himachal Pradesh the question of sharing, on a reciprocal basis, the proportionate pensionary liabilities in respect of those temporary employees who had rendered temporary service under either of the State Governments of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh prior to obtaining posts under the other State Government on their own volition in response to advertisements or circulars, including those by the State Public Service Commissions and who are eventually confirmed in their new posts. It has since been decided by the Government of Punjab, with the concurrence of the Government of Himachal Pradesh, that:- i) in cases in which an employee has rendered temporary service under the Government of Himachal Pradesh before joining service with the Government of Punjab, the liability of pensionary benefits for the service will be shared by the Government of Himachal Pradesh to the extent that service would have qualified for the grant of pension under the pension rules applicable to the employees of the Government of Himachal Pradesh; ii) the liability of pensionary benefits for the temporary services rendered under the Government of Punjab before joining service with the Government of Himachal Pradesh will be shared by the Government of Punjab to the extent that service would have qualified for pension under the rules of the Government of Punjab; iii) the amount of pension shall be determined by the Government from the service of which the employee finally retires in acordance with the pension formula applicable in that Government at the time of retirement of the employee; and iv) the gratuity, if any, received by the employees for temporary service under either State Government will have to be refunded by them to the State Government from which it was received for the service under that Government. . This benefit will be admissible only to the following categories of employees namely:- i) those who having been retrenched from the service of the either of the State Governments obtained on their own employment under these State Governments either with or without interruption between the date of retrenchment and the date of retrenchment and the date of new appointment; and -6- ii) those who while holding temporary posts under either of the State Governments apply for posts under the other State Government through proper channel/with permission of the Administrative authority concerned. . The benefit may be allowed in such cases also in which an employee is required, for administrative reasons/ for satisfying technical requirement, to tender resignation from the temporary post held by him before joining the new appointment, and a certificate, to the effect that such resignation had been tendered for administrative reasons/to satisfy a technical requirement to join the new posts with the permission of the Administrative authority concerned may be issued by the authority accepting the resignation. Necessary record may also be made in the service book under proper attestation to enable the employee concerned to get this benefit at the time of retirement. . These orders shall come into force with effect from the 31st March, 1982 and cases of all employees retiring on that date or thereafter will be regulated accordingly.

Sd/- D.D.A (HQ) for Director of Agriculture, Punjab. -7- . The reply given by the respondents to the relevant para (Para No.8), where the said circular has been referred to and relied upon by the petitioner, is the same; that is, that at the time of his selection, the petitioner had neither requested the Punjab Public Service Commission for protection of his pay on his selection as Statistical Officer, nor had the Punjab Public Service Commission recommended the same. . On a query put to Sh. K.K. Gupta, learned Addl. Advocate General, Punjab, he has relied upon the same submissions as made in the written statement; and has further argued that, it was for the petitioner to apply to the Himachal Pradesh Government to grant him such pensionary benefits. . I absolutely fail to understand, as to how the stand taken in the written statement, and by the learned counsel for the respondents, is tenable in any manner, in the face of the clear cut circular/instructions issued by the Finance Department, vide Memo dated 20.03.1986, reproduced hereinabove. As to why the petitioner (now a pensioner), should be made to run to the Government of Himachal Prades to claim his pensionary benefits, when the present respondents (State of Punjab in the Department of Agriculture), are bound by the said circular/instructions, is not understandable. The circular makes it incumbent upon the Punjab Government, to claim proportionate share of the petitioner pension from the Himachal Pradesh Government. It needs mention that nowhere in the reply is it stated that the petitioner's earlier service in Himachal Pradesh, does not qualify for pension. . No doubt, no plea has been raised by the respondents, but it is, nevertheless, necessary to deal with the same that, the said -8- circular/instructions, refer to only service rendered by temporary employees in either State, for the purpose of such service is to be counted in the either State, towards pensionary benefits. However, this cannot be a bar for an employee better placed than a temporary employee, who was confirmed in the first State and, thereafter, joined service of the second State. Thus, if benefit of temporary service in another State can be given to an employee in the second State, there is no rational basis, whatsoever, for denying such benefit to an employee who was confirmed in the first State and, subsequently was employed in the other State. . Further, though the Government of Himachal Pradesh has not been impleaded as a party in the present writ petition, however, in view of the fact that the Memo dated 20.03.1986 categorically refers to a reciprocal agreement between the two States, it would not be necessary for such impleadment, in view of the fact that the liability to be foisted on that Government, would be in terms of the reciprocal agreement so reached. . I, therefore, hold that the respondents would be bound by the said circular/instructions (dated 20.03.1986), which are not denied by them, and, as such, the petitioner would be entitled to the benefits of the same, as per its terms and conditions. . The writ petition is thus allowed, to the extent of grant of pensionary benefits to the petitioner, by counting his service rendered in Himachal Pradesh. The respondents are directed to work out all the pensionary benefits, admissible to the petitioner after counting the service rendered by him in the Government of Himachal Pradesh, prior -9- to his joining service in the State of Punjab on the post of Statistical Officeer. Such benefits would be worked out and paid to the petitioner within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order. . Needless to say, the liability to be incurred upon the Government of Himachal Pradesh would be taken up by the respondents with that State Government in terms of the reciprocal agreement reached between the two States, referred to in the Circular dated 20.03.1986.

JUSTICE AMOL RATTAN SINGH Present: Mr. Puneet Gupta, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. K.K. Gupta, Addl. Advocate General, Punjab for the respondents-State. *** Amol Rattan Singh, J. . In this petition, the petitioner has sought the benefits of the service rendered by him with the Government of Himachal Pradesh, as a College Lecturer, towards protection of substantive pay, pay fixation and other benefits, including pensionary benefits, for his subsequent service with the Punjab Government. . At the very outset, Sh. Puneet Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, stated that he only presses the case for grant of benefit of the said service in Himachal Pradesh, for pensionary benefits. . The admitted facts of the case are that, the petitioner was appointed as a Lecturer of Economics in the Education Department of -2- Himachal Pradesh on 29.09.1967, in the pay scale of `300-600/-. He was confirmed as such w.e.f. 10.03.1972. . In response to an advertisement issued by the Punjab Public Service Commission, for recruitment to the post of Statistical Officer (PAS Class-I), in the Agriculture Department of the Punjab Government, the petitioner applied through proper channel and his application was forwarded by the Director of the Education Department, Himachal Pradesh to the Secretary, Punjab Public Service Commission, Patiala, vide letter dated 31.08.1973, (annexed as Annexure P-1 with the petition). . Having been duly selected by the Commission, he was appointed as Statistical Officer, in the pay scale of `400-1250/-. Consequent thereupon, the Director of Education, Himachal Pradesh, ordered his relieving on 27.05.1974, with the condition that he would resign his post on the expiry of two years from the date of his relieving, in case he does not join back in the department; that's to say, his lien was retained for a period of two years, in the Department of Education, in Himachal Pradesh. He was actually relieved by the Principal, Government College, Nahan (Himachal Pradesh), on the afternoon of 30.05.1974, on which date he was drawing a substantive pay of `450/-. He joined thereafter, in Punjab. Thereafter, he resigned from Himachal Pradesh, and his resignation was accepted w.e.f. 31.05.1976, vide order dated .10.1976, which is also annexed as Annexure P-3 with the petition. . It is stated by the petitioner, and not denied by the respondents, that upon entering into service in Punjab, he represented to -3- the respondents that his pay at the rate of `450/- be protected, as he was a confirmed employed of the Himachal Pradesh Government and that the same benefit had been granted to one Sh. Sukhdev Singh, who was earlier working with the Himachal Pradesh Government and was subsequently employed by the respondent department, i.e. Directorate of Agriculture, Punjab. . Vide letter dated 13.9.1988, the petitioner was informed that his case for counting temporary service rendered in the Government of Himachal Pradesh, would be considered as soon as he is confirmed in his present post, i.e. the post of Statistical Officer. Though, in the reply, it is stated that his representation was rejected in the year , but it is, at the same time, admitted that it was subsequently decided on 19.04.1988, that his case for counting of previous service would be considered upon his confirmation. . Thereafter, the petitioner was confirmed in the Punjab Agriculture Service, Class-I, on 02.11.1992, upon which he again represented for benefit of previous service. The representation having been rejected in March, 1994, he yet again represented on 04.10.1994 that his case be considered sympathetically, upon which he was again informed on 19.05.1995 that his case had already been rejected earlier. These factual aspects are not denied in the reply filed by the respondents. . The stand taken in the reply filed, is that, since the petitioner had not requested the Punjab Public Service Commission for protection of his pay for pensionary purposes, at the time when he applied for the post of Statistical Officer, Punjab, his case has been -4- rejected. As opposed to this, the case of Sh. Sukhdev Singh, cited by the petitioner, was accepted, in view of the fact that he had made such a representation, along with his application, to the Punjab Public Service Commission, which had accepted the same. Consequently, the Government had implemented the decision of the Punjab Public Service Commission. . Sh. Puneet Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, has drawn my attention to copy of a Memo dated 20.03.1986 (Annexure P- ), issued by the Department of Finance and addressed to all the Heads of Departments in the State of Punjab, duly received by the Director, Agriculture, Punjab, i.e. respondent No.2. The said memo/circular states, in effect, that, after consultations between the Governments of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, it has been decided, on reciprocal basis, that the proportionate pensionary liability in respect of those temporary employees, who had rendered temporary service under either the Punjab or the Himachal Pradesh Governments, prior to obtaining posts under the other State Government, would be shared by such previous government to the extent that such service qualified for pensionary benefits. The said circular is reproduced here, in extenso: Copy of Memo.

Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest ? CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MOHINDER PAL.\n\nPresent: Mr. Ashit Malik, Advocate, for the appellants. Ms. Sushma Chopra, Additional Advocate General, Haryana.\n\n-.- MOHINDER PAL, J. This appeal has been filed by appellants Gurnam Singh and Satnam Singh against the judgment of conviction dated .7.1998 and the sentence order dated 17.7. 1998 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Panipat, convicting and sentencing them under Section 307 and 506 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code (for short `the Code'). For the former -2- offence, the appellants were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay fine of Rs.2,000/- each, in default whereof to undergo further imprisonment for three months and for the latter offence they were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months. However, both the sentences awarded to the appellants were ordered to run concurrently. Bachan Singh (co-accused of the appellants) died during the trial and criminal proceedings against them, accordingly, stood abated. In brief, the case of the prosecution is that on 13.5.1993 at about 9.30 P.M, Gurnam Singh and Jeet Singh were quarrelling with each other as there was some dispute amongst them about rent. Hearing their noise, Hukam Singh and Pala Singh went there. Hukam Singh asked them as to why they were quarrelling with each other. Upon this, Bachan Singh (died accused) caught hold of Hukam Singh. Appellant Gurnam Singh gave a `Gandasa' blow to Hukam Singh on his neck. Appellant Satnam Singh gave a `Lathi' blow to him. On receipt of the said injuries, Hukam Singh fell down. The accused also gave `Lathi' blows to Ajit Singh, who sustained multiple injuries on his body. Pala Ram raised an alarm attracting Jagdish, Ramesh and some other persons to the spot. They save the victims from the clutches of the accused. The accused, while leaving the spot, threatened Hukam Singh that they would kill him whenever they got a chance to do so. The instant F.I.R was registered on the basis of statement made by Pala -3- Singh before the police. During investigation, weapons of offence i.e `Lathi' and `Gandasi' were recovered from the possession of accused-appellants Satnam Singh and Gurnam Singh, respectively, in consequence of their disclosure statements. Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6), who had medico-legally examined injured Hukam Singh, on an application moved by the accused, opined that the possibility could not be ruled out that the injury suffered by Hukam Singh on his neck could have caused his death. He further opined the possibility of the said injury having been suffered by Hukam Singh with `Gandasa' (Exhibit P.1) could not be ruled out. After completion of investigation, report under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure was presented by the police against the accused in the Court of the Ilaqa Magistrate, who committed the case to the Court of Session. The accused were charged for the offences punishable under Sections 307, 323 and 506 read with Section 34 of the Code. They did not plead guilty to the charge and claimed trial. At the trial, the prosecution examined Dr. R.K. Tandon (P.W.1), who had medico-legally examined injured Jeet Singh, Sub Inspector Badan Singh (P.W.2), an eye-witness Pala Ram (P.W.3), injured Hukam Singh (P.W.4), Zile Singh (P.W.5), Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6), who had medico-legally examined injured Hukam Singh, Patwari Daya Nand (P.W.7), an eye-witness Jagdish (P.W.8), who turned hostile, another eye-witness Ramesh -4- (P.W.9), who also turned hostile, Assistant Sub Inspector Zile Singh (P.W.10), injured Jeet Singh (P.W.11), who also turned hostile and Dr.Sunil Bajaj (P.W.12). After the closure of the prosecution evidence, statements of the accused were recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in which they denied the prosecution allegations and pleaded false implication. However, no evidence was led by them in defence. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. Complainant Pala Ram (P.W.3), injured Hukam Singh (P.W.4) and Zile Singh (P.W.5), witness to the recoveries of weapons of offence from the accused in consequence of the disclosure statements made by them, have completely supported the prosecution story, as unfolded in the earlier part of the judgment. There is no dispute with regard to the identity of the accused. It is also worth-mentioning here that there was no enmity between the accused and complainant Pala Ram (P.W.3), injured Hukam Singh (P.W.4) and Zile Singh (P.W.5); meaning thereby question of false implication of the accused did not arise. Pala Ram (P.W.3), Hukam Singh (P.W.4) and Zile Singh (P.W.5) had no axe to grind against the accused. The accused had some dispute with Jeet Singh (P.W.11) regarding tenancy/rent and they were quarrelling with Jeet Singh. The occurrence had taken place in front of the house of Hukam Singh (P.W.4). Pala Ram (P.W.3), brother of Hukam Singh, had come to -5- meet Hukam Singh. Both Pala Ram and Hukam Singh intervened to end the quarrel. However, appellant Gurnam Singh struck a `Gandasa' blow to Hukam Singh on his neck and appellant Satnam Singh gave multiple injuries with `Lathi' to Jeet Singh. Jagdish (P.W.8) and Ramesh (P.W.9) had also been attracted to the spot. However, Jagdish (P.W.8), Ramesh (P.W.9) and Jeet Singh injured (P.W.11) did not support the case of the prosecution and were got declared hostile by the Public Prosecutor. Jagdish (P.W.8), Ramesh (P.W.9) and Jeet Singh injured (P.W.11) were cross-examined by the Public Prosecutor. A verdict of acquittal cannot follow the moment the witnesses turn hostile and dispensation of justice is not dependant upon the witnesses who make efforts to hold the law to ransom. Once the prosecution case is established on record by the other cogent and trustworthy evidence led by the prosecution, non-supporting of its case by the witnesses who appeared to have been won over by the accused does not at all affect the prosecution case. Learned counsel for the appellants argued that Pala Ram (P.W.3), Hukam Singh (P.W.4) and Zile Singh (P.W.5) are real brothers and, therefore, their statements cannot be relied upon being interested witnesses. However, merely because of their relationship inter se, there statements cannot be brushed aside in case they otherwise inspire confidence of the Court. Zile Singh (P.W.5) is a witness to the recoveries of `Gandasa' and `Lathi' from the accused in consequence of their disclosure statements. Hukam Singh (P.W.4), -6- having received a dangerous to life injury on his neck, is a stamped witness of the prosecution. His version is supported by Pala Singh (P.W.3), who had witnessed the occurrence which took place in front of the house of Hukam Singh (P.W.4). Pala Singh (P.W.3) is a natural witness. Statements of Pala Singh and Hukam Singh get complete corroboration from the medical evidence furnished by Dr. R.K. Tandon (P.W.1), who had medico- legally examined injured Jeet Singh and Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6), who had medico-legally examined injured Hukam Singh. Dr. R.K. Tandon (P.W.1) had observed eight injuries on the person of Pala Singh, which were multiple abrasions on the left chin, leg, thyroid cartilage, lower half of neck, front of chest, right upper part of the abdomen, back of right elbow joint, both knee joints, on the middle of lower back at the level of iliac crest. As mentioned above, Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6) had medico- legally examined injured Hukam Singh. He had observed a wound on the neck of Hukam Singh. Vertebral bone was visible in the depth of the wound. Probing was not done due to risk of life of Hukam Singh. The wound was present on the back of neck on both sides of mid line being 7 cms on left side of mid line and rest of the wound on the left side. It was obliquely placed. There was fresh bleeding present in the wound. On an application moved by the accused, Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6) opined that the possibility could not be ruled out that the injury suffered by Hukam Singh on his neck could have caused his death. He further opined the possibility of the said injury having been suffered by -7- Hukam Singh with `Gandasa' (Exhibit P.1) could not be ruled out. The medical evidence furnished by Dr. R.K. Tandon (P.W.1) and Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6), thus, lends complete corroboration to the ocular version given by Pala Ram (P.W.3), Hukam Singh (P.W.4). Under the circumstances, the inescapable conclusion is that the appellants had caused injuries to Hukam Singh and Jeet Singh. For the aforesaid reasons, I do not find any merit in this appeal and the same is hereby dismissed.\n\nJanuary 21, 2010.\n\n( MOHINDER PAL ) ak\n\nJUDGE",

Ms. Sushma Chopra, Additional Advocate General, Haryana.\n\n-.- MOHINDER PAL, J. This appeal is directed against the judgment of conviction and the sentence order dated 5.11.1998 passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Narnaul, whereby Dhiru alias Manbir (appellant) was convicted under Section 376 read -2- with Section 511 of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to as `the Code') and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay fine of Rs.2,000/-, in default whereof to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for three months. The instant F.I.R was registered against the appellant on the basis of the statement made before the police by the prosecutrix, a married lady, (name withheld) wherein she stated that on 1.10.1997 at about 10 A.M, when she was present alone at her house, the appellant came to her house; that he took her in the `Bara' where the lambs were confined; that thereafter he took her in the `Turi Wala Chappar' and stripped her, gagged her mouth, made her lie on the ground and tried to commit rape upon her; and that she resisted and cried for help. She further stated that, in the meanwhile, her mother Smt. Maina Devi came after collecting the fodder from the fields and that on seeing Smt. Maine Devi the appellant ran away from the spot. Smt. Mafia, aunt of the prosecutrix, her uncle Maksud and Dharambir, who had been attracted to the spot, had seen the appellant running away from the spot. After completion of investigation, challan was presented against the appellant in Court. The accused was charged under Section 376 read with Section 511 of the Code. He did not plead guilty to the charge and claimed trial. In order to prove its case, the prosecution examined -3- Sub Inspector Balbir Singh (P.W.1), Constable Bhim Singh (P.W.2), Constable Mahesh Kumar (P.W.3), Smt. Maina (P.W.4), Dharambir (P.W.5), Smt. Mafia (P.W.6) and Assistant Sub Inspector Sube Singh (P.W.7). Statement of the accused-appellant was thereafter recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure wherein he denied the prosecution allegations and pleaded innocence. The appellant examined Amar Singh (D.W.1) and Gaje Singh (D.W.2) in his defence. Both the defence witnesses stated that the prosecutrix was mentally deranged from her childhood; that the mother of the accused had lent Rs.5000/- to the mother of the prosecutrix; and that a dispute arose between them regarding this transaction. They further stated that to take revenge from the mother of the accused, the mother of the prosecutrix got the accused challaned in this case falsely. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. In this case the prosecutrix has not been examined. Smt. Maina (P.W.4), mother of the prosecutrix, in her cross- examination stated that the prosecutrix was married about two years prior to the occurrence; that she stayed at her matrimonial house only for a night; that the prosecutrix was willing to go to her matrimonial house; that they were interested to send the prosecutrix to her matrimonial house and that the husband of the prosecutrix was also willing to take her. Smt. Maina (P.W.4),admitted that the prosecutrix was mentally deranged. -4- After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and going through the evidence on record, I am of the considered opinion that it was a case of attempted sexual intercourse falling within the definition of Section 376 read with Section 511 of the Code. The evidence of Smt. Maina (P.W.4), Dharambir (P.W.5) and Smt. Mafia (P.W.6) establishes the case of the prosecution against the appellant. Smt. Maina (P.W.4), mother of the prosecutrix, stated that when she returned from the fields after collecting fodder, she heard the `raula' and went to the place of occurrence where she found the prosecutrix lying naked. The appellant had also put off one of his trousers. He was trying to commit rape upon the prosecutrix. On seeing Smt.Maina, the appellant ran away from the spot. Dharambir (P.W.5) and Smt. Mafia (P.W.6), who had been attracted to the spot on hearing the noise, had witnessed the appellant running away from the spot while chaining / zipping his Pants. No doubt Smt. Maina (P.W.4) has admitted in her cross-examination that the prosecutrix was mentally deranged and, thus, obviously unable to get her statement recorded before the police, but keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case this fact hardly affects the veracity of the prosecution version. As the prosecutrix was not examined by the prosecution, it shows that she was not capable of deposing before Court. In offences like the present one, the prosecutrix is the main and key witness because she being the victim can narrate the incident. As noticed above, besides the prosecutrix, in this case there -5- is evidence of Smt. Maina (P.W.4), Dharambir (P.W.5) and Smt. Mafia (P.W.6), discussed above, which connects the accused with the crime. There was no hindrance for the mother of the prosecutrix to get the First Information Report recorded in this case by making her statement before the police. It appears that in fact Smt. Maina had narrated the facts before the Investigating Officer, but the Investigating Officer, with an object to help the accused, got the thumb impression of the prosecutrix on the statement (Exhibit P.A) knowing fully well that she (prosecutrix) was mentally deranged. The Investigating Officer ought to have recorded the First Information Report on the statement of Smt. Maina if the prosecutrix was not in a position to explain the things because of her mental incapability and there would not have been anything illegal in it. If the Investigating Officer got the thumb impression of the prosecutrix on the statement (Exhibit P.A), it does not at all demolishes the prosecution case, which stands otherwise proved on record, as discussed above. A fault committed by the police official cannot be made the basis for not bringing the culprit to book and the facts and circumstances on record, in totality, form the basis for the Courts to reach to a correct conclusion. Had Smt. Maina (P.W.4), mother of the prosecutrix, not arrived at her house timely, the appellant would have been able to commit rape upon the prosecutrix. The appellant had no business to go to the house of the prosecutrix when she was alone. The facts and circumstances of the case, enumerated above, suggest that the -6- appellant had gone to the house of the prosecutrix to commit rape on her taking advantage of the fact that she was mentally regarded. In view of the above, the prosecution has been able to bring home the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts under Section 376 read with Section 511 of the Code. Therefore, no interference is called for in the impugned judgment of conviction and the sentence order. Resultantly, this appeal is hereby dismissed. December 23, 2009.\n\n( MOHINDER PAL ) ak JUDGE",

Mr. S.S.Mor, Senior Deputy Advocate General, Haryana for respondent-State. S. D. ANAND, J. The appellants (in both the appeals aforementioned) were convicted by the learned Trial Judge for the offences under Sections 376, and 363 IPC. For the offence under Section 376 IPC, both the appellants were directed to undergo imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.5000/- each. For the offence under Section -2- **** IPC, both the appellants were directed to undergo imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/- each and, for the offence under Section 363 IPC, both the appellants were directed to undergo imprisonment for a period of three years and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/- each. The prosecution allegations upheld at the trial were as under:- Appellant Naresh Kumar is a tailor by profession and so also is appellant Isham Singh. On 23.4.1996, prosecutrix V and the prosecutrix M, who were class mates in the same educational institution, went over to the shop of the appellants in order to get their clothes stitched. They were persuaded by the appellant to stay on at the shop with a promise that they would stitch their clothes there and then. However, appellant Isham Singh suddenly put down shutter of the shop. On finding that, prosecutrix M went to the enclosed Bara through back side window of the shop while the prosecutrix V continued to remain in the shop; Appellant Naresh Kumar followed the prosecutrix M. Thereafter, appellant Isham Singh raped prosecutrix V. She did not raise a raula as that appellant held out a threat that she would be killed if she raised a raula. When, (after the act) she came out of the shop through that very window, she found her friend the prosecutrix M standing in the corner of the Bara. Prosecutrix M told prosecutrix V that former had been raped by appellant Naresh. Like-wise, the prosecutrix V informed her friend the prosecutrix M that Isham Singh had likewise ravished her. Both prosecutrix M and prosecutrix V came over to their houses but did not share anything with the members of their families out of a sense of shame. After about one month thereof, prosecutrix V started vomiting. She got suspicious that she might have become pregnant. She brought the fact to the notice of Isham Singh. He -3- **** advised her to finish her examination and assured her that, thereafter, she would be taken to a Doctor at Karnal for treatment. On the asking of appellant Isham Singh, both the girls came out of their respective home on .4.1996 and reached Bus Stand in the area of village Sandhir where appellant Isham Singh again met them. Both the girls came up to Nilokheri in a Tonga where appellant Isham Singh met them and the trio were joined soon thereafter by appellant Naresh Kumar. All four of them reached Karnal by bus. Isham Singh went alone to find out the availablity of the Doctor. He returned some time thereafter and informed the rest of the party that the Doctor was not available. Thereafter, all of them came over to Delhi. Both the girls stayed over at Bus Stand; while Isham Singh and Naresh Kumar went over to contact a Doctor. They returned sometime thereafter and informed that the hospital would open at 5.00 P.M. After .00 P.M. Appellants informed the girls that hospital would not open on that day. From there, they boarded a train and reached Banaras. There, both the appellants raped prosecutrix V and M respectively. From there, they came over to Ambala where they reached on the evening of 26.4.1996. On 27.4.1996, they reached Rajpura and spent two nights in a park at Rajpura. In the course of the stay, Isham Singh raped prosecutrix V and Naresh raped prosecutrix M. From there, they came over to karnal by bus. They boarded a train from Karnal and reached Nilokheri. It is there that they were apprehended. There is plethora of evidence on the file that prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M were consenting party to their elopement from their respective homes and the ravishing of their person by the appellants. It is in the evidence that they had been travelling by train, bus and also by Tonga. All the means of transport aforementioned had the availablity of -4- **** other persons but the girls did not make a grievance against the appellant. In view of the fact that there is no controversy (as between the appellants and also the State) about it all having been consensual affair, the fate of the prosecution shall, thus, turn upon the question of age of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M. The evidence adduced by the prosecution in the context consists of the statements of PW-1 Dr. G.S.Arora (who had conducted the ultrasound examination) of prosecutrix V, PW-11 Dr. Nirmal Bhatia, who conducted the medico legal examinations of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M on 29.4.1996, PW-6 Bhagat Ram, Headmaster, Government Middle School, Sandhir, PW-7 Pawant Kumar, brother of prosecutrix V and PW-8 Ramesh Chand, father of prosecutrix M. Insofar as PW-1 Dr. G.S.Arora is concerned, he did aver in the course of examination-in-chief that he had recorded the age of the prosecutrix as 16 years. However, in the course of cross-examination, he conceded that he had recorded the age of the prosecution on the basis of what already stood recorded in the MLR. PW-11 Dr. Nirmal Bhatia also recorded the age of prosecutrix V as 16 years and age of prosecutrix M as 14 years respectively. In the course of the cross examination, she testified that I have given the age of Vijay Laxmi by approximation as told by her. I did not examine the girls regarding age medically. PW-6 Bhagat Ram, Headmaster, Government Middle School, Sandhir proved certificates Ex. PG/2 and Ex. PF/1 respectively as per which the age of the prosecutrix M is recorded as 10.1.1982 and that of prosecutrix V is recorded as 12.1.1981. PW-7 Pawan Kumar testified that age of prosecutrix V was less than 16 years because she is 12 years younger to him. He had given -5- **** his age as 27 years. PW-8 Ramesh Chand gave the age of prosecutrix M as 14 years. It is apparent from the record that the prosecution has not placed on record any birth certificates of prosecutrix V and also prosecutrix M. We have to ultimately adjudicate upon the relevant controversy on the basis of the value to be attached to the testimony of PW-6 Bhagat Ram. He could not say who exactly had filled up the admission forms, copies of whereof were placed on record Ex. PG/2 and Ex. PF/1. It is also in his statement that there is no other proof of date of birth of .......... and ........... given in our school alongwith admission form . Though he claimed to have had brought along original admission forms pertaining to prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M, he conceded that he had not brought along the complete file and that he had taken those forms out of the record from the main file in which those were lying pasted. He also conceded that the file in which the admission forms were lying pasted does not have any paging. He also conceded, as correct, a suggestion that there is no date under the signature of the the then Head Master on admission forms copies of which are Ex. PF/1 and Ex. PG/2 He further conceded, as correct, a suggestion that such like blank admission form are available in our school as well as in the market . The persons who got the prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M admitted to the school were not examined at the trial. The prosecution, thus, has not been able to prove at all the basis where upon the date of birth of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M had been recorded in the school admission record. The present is, thus, a case in which the following inference is -6- **** deducible:- a) No birth record pertaining to prosecutrix V and the prosecutrix M was produced; There is no affirmative evidence either that their birth was not notified. b) There is no proof on the record to indicate the basis where upon the date of birth of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M had been recorded in the school admission form; c) the persons who got prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M admitted into the school were not examined at the trial.\n\nIn the light thereof, the only inference which is deducible in the circumstances of the case is that the prosecution has not been able to prove the age of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M. The benefit thereof had has to accrue to the appellants, particularly in view of the evidence that it was all a consensual affair, as between prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M and the appellants.

The instant case was registered at the instance of Kahan Singh, brother of Harbans Kaur (deceased). As per facts of the case, Harbans Kaur (deceased) was married to appellant Tapinderpal Singh on 18.2.1994. Sufficient dowry was given at the time of marriage by the parents of Harbans Kaur according to their status. Seven or eight days after the marriage, appellant Tapinderpal Singh, husband of Harbans Kaur, Avtar Singh, her father-in-law and Kartar Kaur, her mother-in-law started telling her that her parents had not given sufficient dowry. On this account, she was mal-treated and was asked to bring Rs.25,000/- from her parents.

Impugned in this appeal is the judgment of conviction and the sentence order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Ludhiana, convicting and sentencing the appellants under Section 498-A and 304-B of the Indian Penal Code (for short `the Code').

After completion of investigation and due formalities, challan against the accused was presented before the Ilaqa Magistrate, who committed the case to the Court of Session. Charge under Sections 498-A and 304-B of the Code was framed against the accused, who did not plead guilty to the charge and claimed trial. At the trial, the prosecution examined Draftsman Sukhwinder Singh (P.W.1), Dr. S.K. Gupta (P.W.2), complainant Kahan Singh (P.W.3), Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4), Sub Inspector Sikattar Singh (P.W.5), Assistant Sub Inspector Makhan Singh (P.W.6) and Constable Balbir Singh (P.W.7). In his statement recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh, besides denying the prosecution allegations and pleading false implication, stated as under:-\n\nThe deceased was handsome and beautiful lady whereas I am simpleton, hard of speaking and physically disabled. She was -4- not happy to marry with me and she used to remain in a sorrow mood and complained me that her parents have married her to a dung, which I tolerated. My father on coming to know about her condition, took her to Raikot hospital from where she was referred to Ludhiana hospital and in the way at Sudhar her condition deteriorated and she had to admit at Sudhar. I had cordial relations with my wife and at no stage demanded any dowry and it was sufficient that I was married with such a beautiful girl. In their statements recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, appellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur dittoed the statement of accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh. The accused, in defence, examined Dr.Swaran Singh Sandhu (D.W.1), Surjit Kaur (D.W.2) and Avtar Kaur (D.W.3). I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. At the outset, it may be mentioned here that keeping in view the evidence of the prosecution, its case against appellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur is not free from doubt. In his statement made before the police by complainant Kahan Singh, brother of Harbans Kaur (deceased) leading to the registration of the instant case against the accused, no specific -5- allegations have been made against appellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur, who are parents of appellant Tapinderpal Singh. General allegations have been levelled against them i.e appellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur, conveying that they were hand in glove with appellant Tapinderpal Singh in torturing Smt.Harbans Kaur on account of insufficiency of dowry. It is a tendency on the part of the family of the victim to rope in as many members of the family of the in-laws of the victim in a case like this as possible. Appellant Kartar Kaur was found innocent during investigation by the police and had not been challaned. She was summoned to face trial by the trial Court on an application moved by the prosecution under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Appellant Kartar Kaur is a teacher by profession and it appears that she had nothing to do with the demand of Rs.25,000/-. Harbans Kaur (deceased) was taken to hospital by appellant Avtar Singh on coming to know about her condition. Avtar Singh appellant had first taken Harbans Kaur to the clinic of Dr.Swaran Singh Sandhu (D.W.1) at Raikot. Dr. Swaran Singh Sandhu (D.W.1) had referred Harbans Kaur to C.M.C, Ludhiana as her condition was serious. Dr. Swaran Singh Sandhu (D.W.1), who was M.B.B.S, M.S (General Surgery) ex-P.C.M.S proved the slip/Certificate (Exhibit D.A) whereby Harbans Kaur was referred by him to C.M.C, Ludhiana. The role of appellant Tapinderpal Singh in the commission of the crime will be discussed in the later part of the judgment. However, keeping in view the facts and circumstances -6- of the case, especially the fact that appellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur had nothing to do with the demand of dowry, I am of the considered opinion that the case of the prosecution against them has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubts and they are entitled to be extended the benefit of doubt. The question arises as to whether accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh is liable for the offences under Section 498-A and Section 304-B of the Code for which offences he has been found guilty by the learned trial Judge. Section 304-B of the Code, for facility of reference, is reproduced hereunder:-\n\n-B. Dowry death.- (1) Where the death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that soon before her death she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband for, or in connection with, any demand for dowry, such death shall be called dowry death , and such husband or relative shall be deemed to have caused her death .\n\nAs per the provisions of Section 304-B of the Code, -7- the offence of dowry death consists of three ingredients i.e death of a woman is caused by burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances; that the death occurs within seven years of her marriage; and that soon before her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or his relatives for or in connection with any demand for dowry. If these three ingredients are there, the offence of dowry death can be said to be complete and proved. In this case, admittedly Harbans Kaur had died within two months of marriage, as her marriage with appellant Tapinderpal Singh had taken place on 18.12.1994 and she died on 3.2.1995. Death of Harbans Kaur occurred otherwise than under normal circumstances. Dr. S.K. Gupta (P.W.2), who had conducted post mortem examination on the dead body of Harbans Kaur, after receipt of the report of the Chemical Examiner that Aluminium Phosphide was detected in the viscera, had declared the cause of death due to poison. The fact that soon before her death Harbans Kaur was subjected to cruelty or harassment by appellant Tapinderpal Singh for or in connection with any demand of dowry, is proved on record as is evident from the evidence led by the prosecution. Complainant Kahan Singh (P.W.3) and Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4) have deposed that Harbans Kaur (deceased) had been married with appellant Tapinder Singh on 18.12.1994. The evidence of Kahan Singh (P.W.3) and Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4) is consistent about their -8- visits to the village of appellant Tapinderpal Singh. Appellant Tapinderpal Singh was running a Medical Store and had demanded Rs.25,000/- from the parents of the deceased in order to expand his business. The depositions of Kahan Singh (P.W.3) and Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4) establish without any doubt the case of the prosecution against appellant Tapinderpal Singh. Appellant Tapinderpal Singh, as observed above, in his statement recorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, has taken the plea that the deceased was a beautiful lady whereas he was a simpleton, hard of speaking and physically disabled; that she was not happy to marry appellant Tapinderpal Singh and that she used to remain in a sorrow mood. However, before the marriage of Harbans Kaur with appellant Tapinderpal Singh, all these facts must have been brought to the notice of the parents of Harbans Kaur by the persons who had acted as intermediaries in arranging this marriage, but at no stage Harbans Kaur or her parents raised any objection. Ranbir Singh Sarpanch (D.W.4) has disclosed the names of persons who had acted as intermediaries in arranging this marriage and they are Jagdev Singh, Harbans Singh and Gian Singh of Village Talwandi. None of these persons has been examined by appellant Tapinderpal Singh. They were the best persons who could throw light upon the circumstances whether it was a forced marriage or whether the facts of appellant Tapinderpal Singh being stammering and simpleton were brought to the notice of Harbans Kaur and her parents prior to the marriage. Three photographs of appellant -9- Tapinderpal Singh with deceased Harbans Kaur taken on the occasion of marriage are on record. One photograph depicts the occasion of ring ceremony where the bride is putting ring on the ring finger of the bridegroom. These photographs do not indicate that it was a forced marriage. The defence taken by appellant Tapinderpal Singh in this regard is an afterthought. The life of Harbans Kaur came to an end by consuming some poisonous substance within two months of her marriage, which shows the magnitude of the harassment meted out to her by appellant Tapinderpal Singh. The above discussed evidence clearly establishes that soon before Harbans Kaur ended her life, she was subjected to cruelty by accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh on account of demand of dowry. So, the third ingredient of the offence of dowry death i.e whether the deceased was subjected to cruelty or harassment soon before her death for or in connection with dowry demands by accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh, stands proved from the evidence on record. For the aforesaid reasons, the prosecution has been able to prove its case against accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh under Section 304-B and 498-A of the Code. The impugned judgment of conviction recorded by the trial Court in respect of appellant Tapinderpal Singh is, therefore, upheld. The sentence imposed upon appellant Ram Sarup also commensurates with the offence committed by him. The impugned sentence order qua appellant Tapinderpal Singh is also, accordingly, upheld. The net result is that this appeal qua appellants -10- Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur is accepted, the impugned judgment of conviction and the sentence order qua them are set aside and they are acquitted of the charge framed against them by giving them the benefit of doubt. However, this appeal qua appellant Tapinderpal Singh is dismissed.\n\nJanuary 21, 2010.\n\n( MOHINDER PAL ) ak JUDGE",

Present: Sh.O.P.Goyal Sr.Adv., with Ms.Pawanpreet Kaur Adv. For the petitioner. None for the respondent. JUDGMENT: This revision petition is directed against the judgment dated 28.01.1991 rendered by the Appellate Authority (Additional Distt. Judge), Bhiwani vide which it dismissed the appeal against the order dated 29.09.1989 of the Rent Controller, Charkhi Dadri, fixing the fair rent of the demised premises @ Rs.86/- including house tax w.e.f. 06.01.1988. . The landlord/petitioner inducted the respondent, as a tenant in the demised premises as fully detailed, in the ejectment application, at a monthly rental of Rs.78/- + house tax. The ejectment of the respondent/tenant, was sought, on the ground, that he had been in arrears of rent from. 01.11.1987 to 31.12.1987 + house tax, amounting to Rs.108/-. Prayer for fixation of fair rent, was also made, on the ground that after 01.09.1982 when the fair rent, was earlier fixed, there has been an increase in the price index. Accordingly, a combined application under Sections 13 & 4 of Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973, was CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.1436 OF 1991 -2- filed by the landlord/petitioner. . Upon notice, the respondent/tenant, put in appearance, and filed written statement, wherein, he admitted the relationship of landlord and tenant. The rate of rent, at Rs.78/- per month (including house tax), was admitted. It was stated that the arrears of rent, demanded by the landlord/petitioner, had already been paid by him. It was further stated that the fair rent of the shop in-question, at Rs.78/- per month, had already been fixed and there had been no increase in the price index, and, thus, there was no question of fixing the fair rent again. . In the replication, filed by the landlord/petitioner, he reiterated all the averments, contained in the petition and repudiated those contained in the written statement. . On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were struck, by the Rent controller:- . Whether the respondent is liable to be ejected from the premises indispute, as alleged? OPA . Whether there are grounds for the fixation of fair rent, if so at what rate ? OPA . Whether the applicant has no locus-standi to file the application ? OPR . Whether the application is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties ? OPR . Relief. . The parties led documentary, as well as oral evidence, in support of their case. After hearing the Counsel for the parties, and on, going through the record of the case, the Rent Controller, fixed the fair rent at Rs.86/- (round figure) per month, w.e.f. .01.1988 including house tax. Since the Counsel for the landlord/petitioner conceded that the respondent had paid the arrears of rent, including cost and interest, no finding was recorded on issue No.1, as the same was rendered redundant. -3- . Feeling aggrieved, against the judgment dated .09.1989, the landlord preferred an appeal, which was dismissed by the Appellate Authority (Additional Distt. Judge), Bhiwani. . Dissatisfied with the judgments of the Courts below, the instant revision petition, was filed by the landlord/petitioner. . Notice of the petition, was given to the respondent/tenant. Initially, Counsel for the respondent/tenant, put in appearance but, lateron none appeared on his behalf. . I have heard the Counsel for the petitioner and have gone through the record of the case carefully. . The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the formula for fixing the fair rent, depicted in Section 4(2) of Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973, was interpreted and approved by a Division Bench of this Court in Yoginder Mohan Versus Krishan Lal 2000(1) PLR 788. It is to be determined, as to whether, the Courts below, fixed the fair rent in accordance with the formula, referred to above, and in consonance with the principle of law laid down in Yoginder Mohan's case (supra). Admittedly, the basic rent, in this case, was Rs.78/- per month including house tax in the year 1982. The application, out of the decision whereof, the instant revision petition has arisen, was filed on 06.01.1988. The price index of the year 1982 was Rs.285.3 paise and of the year 1987 i.e. one year preceding the filing of the application was Rs.395.7. Under these circumstances, the difference came to be Rs.110.4 or Rs.110/- (round figure). The percentage of difference, between the two figures of price index, came to be Rs.38.69%. The Court could grant increase or decrease to the maximum of 25% under Section 4 (3) of the Act which came to be 9.67%. On this basis the increase in the fair rent came to be Rs.7.54 (78/9.67x100). The -4- fair rent, therefore, came to be Rs.78+7.54 = Rs.85.54. The round figure of fair rent, therefore, came to be Rs.86/- per month w.e.f. .01.1988 including house tax. The calculations were also depicted by the Counsel for the revision petitioner, in a separate chart, which are in consonance with the decision rendered by the Courts below. The Courts below, in my opinion, rightly calculated the fair rent, in accordance with the formula, referred to above, and the principle of law, laid down, in Yoginder Mohan's case (Supra).

(Oral)\n\nJarnail Singh son of Darbara Singh, who was driving the bus bearing registration No. PAB-5108 has been found by the Courts below that due to his act of rash and negligent driving he hit the cycle of Nawab alias Bittu due to which he died at the spot. In the present case, on July 20, 1995, at a motion hearing, learned Bench passed the following order:- Mr. K.S.Dadwal, Advocate Heard the learned counsel and perused the impugned order. This revision is admitted qua sentence only. The petitioner deserves to be admitted to bail and is enlarged on bail subject to his furnishing bail bonds to the satisfaction of the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jalandhar. .7.1995 (K.K.SRIVASTAVA) JUDGE Since the learned Judge after hearing the counsel and perusing the impugned order found not to interfere on the merits of the case, the Court need not to dwell on the factual position of the case. Mr. R.K.Dadwal has very fairly stated that due to the order passed at the motion hearing, he will confine his argument only on quantum of sentence. It has been stated before me that in the present case, accident has taken place in the year 1991. A period of 17 years is going to lapse. From the head note of the trial Court judgement, the age of the petitioner is given as 32 years. Mr. Dadwal has stated that in the last 17 years, petitioner has fastened himself with many liabilities of the family and children. Sending him behind the bars will cause stigma and will have an affect on the marriage prospects of his children. It has been further stated at bar that petitioner, in the last 17 years, has committed no offence. Hon ble the Apex Court has taken a view that in cases of accident, probation should not be granted. The petitioner is said to have undergone about one week behind the bars. His sentence from one year was reduced to nine months by the learned Appellate Court in the year . For the last 13 years much water has flown. Taking protracted trial into consideration and fact that sending the petitioner behind the bars will serve no useful purpose, I deem it appropriate to compensate the family of the deceased by awarding a fine of Rs.50,000/-, which will be given as compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased. On deposit of Rs.50,000/-, the sentence of petitioner shall stand reduced to already undergone. Sentence of fine shall be deposited in the trial Court on 15.5.2008. Non-deposit of fine by the petitioner will render this petition as dismissed. With these modifications, the present revision petition is disposed off.

None for respondent Nos.3 to 8. **** RANJIT SINGH, J. (ORAL) Mr.Ahuja, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner is apparently flogging a dead horse. The claim of the petitioner, who is no more, is not only pressed hard despite knowing that even two respondents, against whom, he was claiming seniority, are also died. The seniority claim of the late petitioner, which is being pursued by his L.Rs, is made out the ground of his appointment in the regular service. It appears that the petitioner as well as the respondents were initially appointed as Computor in the pay scale of CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.14364 OF 1991 :{ 2 }: Rs.110-225 in the Directorate of Land Records, Haryana. He joined the duties on 18.9.1978. Subsequently, however, he was absorbed in the respondent-office w.e.f 1.3.1979. Though the petitioner would make reference to various Government notifications but the fact remains that he was regularised w.e.f 15.9.1982. Like him, the private respondents, except respondent No.6, were also regularised with effect from 15.9.1982. The services of respondent No.6 were regularised on 1.4.1985. The grievance of the petitioner is that the date of regularisation of the private respondents was subsequently changed to 1.1.1980. The counsel would contend that the petitioner was senior to the private respondents and on the basis of his seniority as determined in the seniority list issued, he was granted the selection grade, which was allowed to 15% of the posts, in order of seniority. In view of the subsequent change of date of regularisation of the private respondents to 1.1.1980, the petitioner became junior to the private respondents and accordingly the selection grade, which was allowed to him, was withdrawn. Accordingly, the payment which was made to him, was also withdrawn. The record would show that when the petitioner was shown senior to the private respondents, they had filed a civil suit, which was allowed. The petitioner not only filed an appeal against the judgment passed by the Civil Court but also filed present writ petition, which he claims to have filed prior to coming to know of the filing of Civil Court. Apparently, the petitioner has pursued two remedies. His appeal filed against the judgement rendered by the Trial Court was allowed only on the ground that he had challenged the seniority in CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.14364 OF 1991 :{ 3 }: the writ petition. Mr. Som Nath Saini, though is not representing the private respondents in the writ petition but is appearing for the appellant in connected S.A.O. No.22 of 1996, which is being disposed of alongwith the present writ petition. On the basis of record of S.A.O as well as other Civil Writ Petition Nos.8002 of 1999 and 21603 of 2008, Mr.Saini would point out that by no stretch of imagination, the petitioner would rank senior to the private respondents. He would point out that the petitioner was appointed with effect from 18.9.1978, whereas the private respondents were appointed as Computor on 1.12.1977. The petitioner was absorbed in the respondent-Department with effect from 1.3.1979 whereas the private respondents were so absorbed with effect from 1.1.1979. It is in view of this seniority that the private respondents were regularised with effect from 1.1.1980 whereas the petitioner being junior to them was so regularised with effect from 15.1.1982. Because of the seniority, the private respondents had prior right for regularisation on completion of two years of service and, thus, the policy dated .1.1980 was applicable for their regularisation. The petitioner has no basis to make a claim of seniority either on the basis of date of appointment or on the date of regularisation or even on the basis of date of his absorption. Taking the case from any angle, the private respondents always remained senior to him and were so regularised on 1.1.1980. Otherwise also, there is no issue left to be decided in this case in view of the death of the petitioner as well as two of the respondents. The selection grade was required to be granted on the basis of seniority to the 15% of the CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.14364 OF 1991 :{ 4 }: posts and accordingly this was rightly withdrawn from the petitioner. There is, thus, no merit in the writ petition. The same is accordingly dismissed. However, since the petitioner was granted this selection grade and he had not made any misrepresentation, the recovery can not be effected from the L.Rs of the petitioner. The consequence of this order would be that S.A.O No.22 of 1996 filed by Charan Singh would have to be allowed and the judgment passed by the first Appellate Court shall stand reversed and the Trial Court order restored. It is so ordered. May 10, 2010\n\n( RANJIT SINGH ) khurmi\n\nJUDGE",

Respondents CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN Present:- Mr. H. S. Saini, Advocate for the petitioners. Ms. Lisa Gill, Advocate for the respondents. **** K. Kannan, J (oral). . The writ petitioners who were Junior Assistants posted as Readers in the subordinate judiciary challenge the reduction of pay scales and recoveries sought to be made when through the proceedings of the Government of Punjab, Department of Finance, notification issued on 19.5.1998, the government had decided to amend the Second Schedule to the Punjab Civil Service Revised Pay First Amendment Rules of 1998. The amendment was issued to take effect from .1.1996 retrospectively. . The petitioners' complaint is that they had been working as ministerial staff as Senior Clerks and Junior Assistants who were put on time scale of Rs.1500-2700 and after 1.1.1996 the scales had been revised and assigned to the scale of Rs.5000-8100. By the impugned proceedings through an office order dated 13.9.1999, the junior assistants were put in the time scale of Rs.4400-7000 w.e.f. 1.1.1996. This resulted in a reduction of scale of pay for persons who had drawn a higher pay when the scales were revised to 5000-8100. When the revision of scales had taken place, it was reduced from Rs.5000-8100 to 4400-7000 and no pay protection had been given to them unlike other classes of persons to whom such protection was given. According to the petitioner the retrospective reduction of scale without protecting the pay which they were drawing was arbitrary. It also discriminated when certain other classes of persons, who like the Duplicating Machine Operators, belonging to the operational staff had been given pay protection when the scale of pay had been reduced. Similarly even in the National Training Institute the craft instructors were given pay protection by applying it uniformly to all persons, whether promoted before or after 1.1.1996. . All the petitioners are persons who had been promoted after 1.1.1996 and who had obtained the higher revised scale but when the revision of scale had been made to a lower scale the higher salary drawn was not protected. Learned counsel for the petitioner refers to a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chairman Railway Board and others Vs. C.R. Rangadhamaiah and others (1997) 6 SCC 623 that dealt with the case of effect of retrospective amendment withdrawing vested or accrued rights of government employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that any retrospective amendment which has the effect of taking away an accrued right of an employee would be liable to be struck down. Learned counsel also refers to a situation of 10 other employees similarly placed, who were working as Junior Assistants in various other departments like Colleges in U.T.Administration, Chandigarh and who were afforded the pay protection while retrospective application of scale of pay was sought to be made through an intervention of order of the Central Administrative Tribunal in OA No. 316/CH/2001 by its order dated .3.2003. According to him, the petitioners could not have any relief before CAT only because they were members of the judiciary and therefore they have sought relief before this Court and they should also enjoy the same relief as the persons similarly situated. . The office order, while reducing the scales of pay to Rs.4400-7000 against the existing scale of Rs.5000-8100 could not have restricted the benefit of pay protection only to persons who had been promoted even before 1.1.1996. If the revision of pay scales had not been brought immediately on 1.1.1996 and all the petitioners had been provided for higher scales from 1.1.1996 an office order that was brought on .9.1999 could not deny such protection to persons who had been promoted subsequently on 1.1.1996 and who had received the higher scales. The revised scale of Rs.4400-7000 should be applied only after providing for protection of salary at the scale which they were drawing. Accordingly, the impugned office order under Annexure P-1 is quashed. . The writ petition is allowed with protection granted as aforesaid. There shall, however, be no order as to costs. (K.

None for the respondent. *** DR.BHARAT BHUSHAN PARSOON, J In this Civil Writ petition filed under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner has sought a writ in the nature of Mandamus or any other writ or orders against the respondent-M.D. University (hereinafter to be referred to as the respondent-University ), to consider his case for promotion to the post of Assistant with effect from the date, his juniors were promoted, along with other consequential benefits. Direction was also sought against the respondent-University for placing the petitioner at serial No. 261 above Shri Rajbir Singh, in the seniority list, taking into account the date of joining of the petitioner on the post of Clerk on ad hoc basis. Claim of the petitioner is that the petitioner was appointed as Clerk on adhoc basis on 25.3.1983 , vide letter (Annexure P-1). His services were regularized on the said post vide order dated 10.11.1983 ( Annexure P-2). Taking the wrong date of appointment of the petitioner as a regular clerk i.e 28.11.1983, he was placed at serial No. 330 in the seniority list and for this reason he was not promoted as Assistant. Further claim of the petitioner is that in fact he joined his duties on .3.1983 and thus he should have been placed at serial No. 261 in the seniority list. It is averred that the petitioner was wrongly not promoted as Assistant and even his representation (Annexure P-7) for assigning appropriate place in the seniority list, was not considered. In addition, the petitioner has claimed that the respondent- University violated its own service rules for non-teaching employees. It is also claimed that the petitioner was treated differently though he was similarly situated with other employees, whose services rendered on adhoc basis were counted towards their probation period but the same benefit was denied to the petitioner. The stand of the respondent-University on the contrary is that no right much less statutory, has been infringed. It has been explained that the petitioner was initially appointed as a Clerk purely on adhoc basis and for a period of six months and that too subject to compliance of certain conditions with effect from 26.3.1983 and had been given extension from time to time. One of the conditions contained in the letter of appointment was that the petitioner has to qualify the written test as well as typing test in English at a speed of 30 words per minute. On his passing the written test, services of the petitioner were regularized by the University with effect from 22.11.1983 but, he was further required to pass the type test. Later on, when he could not qualify the type test, relaxing this condition, on expiry of two years of his probation period, he was confirmed with effect from 28.11.1985. It is claimed that service rendered by the petitioner on adhoc basis, thus , cannot be counted towards his seniority. It has also been explained that before preparing the final seniority list, in May 1988 objections were invited from the concerned officials within 10 days of the issue of the circular, with clear stipulation that in absence of any objections raised within the stipulated period, the seniority list will be treated as final and that since the petitioner had not raised any objection, it was finalized thereafter. Qua claim of the petitioner that other non-teaching employees promoted as Assistants were given the benefits of adhoc service in counting their service period, it is clarified that they had been appointed on regular basis without any rider or conditions attached to their appointment, which was not the case of the petitioner, as he was required to qualify the written examination as also the typing test. In short, the University had claimed that the petitioner had correctly been placed in the seniority list according to the Rules of the University. Prayer for dismissal of the petition was made. Since, there is no representation on behalf of the respondent-University in this petition and the matter is of 1992, instead of adjourning the case for the appearance of the counsel for respondent- University, it is considered appropriate to dispose of the matter after hearing learned counsel for the petitioner. I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the documents placed on the record. In the seniority list issued by the respondent-University name of the petitioner is appearing at serial No. 330, taking the date as .11.1983 i.e the date of his regularization. No doubt, pursuant to his appointment on adhoc basis, the petitioner had joined his duties on .3.1983 but the said period of service rendered on adhoc basis was not counted towards the period of regularization. The reason is not far to seek. It is rather revealed that the petitioner was appointed on 25.3.1983 purely on adhoc basis for a period of six months on the post of a clerk and he joined on 26.03.1983 and was required to qualify the prescribed written test as well as typing test in English and further his services were liable to be terminated at any time without any notice. Accepting these conditions contained in the appointment letter dated 25.3.1983, the petitioner joined his duties on 26.3.1983. Vide letter dated 10.11.1983, services of the petitioner were ordered to be regularized, subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions contained therein which included Verification of character and antecedents as also production of medical fitness Certification from a competent authority . On the fulfillment of said conditions, services of the petitioner were regularized with effect from 22.11.1983 i.e the date on which the said conditions had been fulfilled by the petitioner. Notwithstanding regularization of services of the petitioner with effect from 22,12,1983 (as per communication of 25.10.1984), the petitioner was required to pass the type test in English at the speed of 30 words per minutes before being considered for confirmation on completion of probation period of one year which was to be counted with effect from 22.11.1983. Despite the extension of period of probation, the petitioner had failed to qualify the requisite type test from time to time, till the expiry of period of two years of probation and even thereafter. Showing benevolent mercy, the respondent-University relaxed the condition of passing of typing test and after completion of the extended period of probation of two years, the petitioner was confirmed as a Clerk. From the factual matrix as discussed earlier, it is clear that passing of the typing test was a condition precedent for regularization. Coupled with character verification and antecedents as also production of medical fitness certificate, without waiting for the passing of requisite typing test, services of the petitioner were regularized vide letter dated .10.1984 (Annexure P-3). Since the petitioner was required to qualify the typing test during the period of probation one year, on his failure to do so his services were to be terminated automatically on this ground. Condition No.3 of letter dated 25.10.1984 (Annexure P-3) is extracted as under:- You will, therefore, be on probation for a period of one year in the first instance and the probation will be counted with effect from .11.1983. You will, however, have to qualify the type test in English at the speed of 30 words per minutes before you are considered for confirmation on the completion of your probationary period. In the event of your failure to qualify the type test, your services may stand terminated automatically on this ground . The University instead of terminating services of the petitioner for his failure to qualify the typing test, provided him sustenance and support by relaxing the condition of passing of typing test but the petitioner instead of showing his gratitude towards the University has raised his accusing finger at the respondent and that too without any basis. Stand of the University that the seniority list was prepared on the basis of date of joining of the concerned employees on regular post, and that too after considering the objections from the concerned officials, could not be assailed by the learned counsel for the petitioner. Thus, it is clear that adhering to the Service Rules, the University had acted fairly and had rather relaxed the condition of passing of the typing test when the petitioner had not been able to qualify the said test even during the extended period of probation of two years. In fact this large hearted approach of the University had attributed towards the retention of the petitioner in service otherwise in terms of (extracted earlier), the petitioner was to be off the job. As far as counting of adhoc service rendered by the petitioner is concerned, when the petitioner had not been able to qualify the requisite typing test (which was a condition precedent), he was neither eligible to be appointed as a clerk nor was to be retained in service. The period of adhoc service of the petitioner could not be counted towards the probation period. Stand of the petitioner that he has wrongly been placed at serial No. 330 in the seniority list, taking the date of his joining the post of clerk inter-alia on regular basis (i.e after complying with the other requisite conditions), is without any substance. When clerks other than the petitioner, were promoted as Assistants in terms of their seniority viz-a-viz from the date of joining regular service, they cannot be considered juniors to the petitioner. Looking from another angle, the petitioner was regularized on the post of a clerk vide letter dated 25.10.1984 with effect from .11.1983 ignoring the service rendered by him on adhoc basis and only after counting the regular service rendered by the petitioner, he was confirmed as a clerk with effect from 28.11.1985 vide communication dated 22.3.1986. He, however filed the present writ petition only on .1.1992. Thus, there is long delay in filing the petition revealing that the petitioner had been in long slumber. Consequently, when the petitioner has not been able to show violation of any Service Rules and when his appointment was on adhoc basis, dehors the Rules and was subject to the condition of qualifying the written examination as also of passing of requisite type test in English, the respondent University was right in excluding the period of adhoc service for determination of the seniority. It was also so held in 2001(3) RSJ 15 (SC)- State of Punjab and others Vs. Gurdeep Kumar Uppal and others; 2000(4) RSJ 167 (SC)- State of Haryana Vs. Haryana Veterinary and A.H.T.S.

Mr.PS Sullar, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana Harbans Lal, J. This revision is directed against the judgment dated 5.2.1992 rendered by the Court of Shri Darshan Singh, Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Hisar, whereby he convicted and sentenced the revision petitioner to undergo RI for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- or in default thereof to further undergo RI for a period one and half month, as well as judgment dated 8.7.1994 rendered by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Hisar vide which the period of substantive sentence inflicted by the learned trial Court has been reduced from 6 months rigorous imprisonment to three months rigorous imprisonment maintaining the amount of fine of Rs.1000/- as well as its default clause. As set up by the prosecution, the revisionist- Raghbir Singh is a bus conductor in the employment of Haryana Roadways and is posted in the Office of General Manager, Haryana Roadways, Hisar (hereinafter to be referred as the G.M. ). On 30.6.1990 he was entrusted with bus fare tickets of the value of Rs. 27584/- for being issued to the passengers. He did not deposit the tickets nor the sale proceeds thereof. Thereupon, the G.M. sent a letter Ex.PW3/A to S.H.O., Police Station City Hisar on [2] .7.1990. On its basis, FIR Ex.PW5/A was recorded. The revisionist was placed under suspension vide order dated 12.9.1990. He put in his appearance before the G.M. on 12.11.1990 and explained his absence from .7.1990 to 13.11.1990. The latter sanctioned earned leave to the revisionist for the aforesaid period vide order dated 21.11.1990 (copy Ex.D2) and ordered his reinstatement w.e.f. 14.11.1990. He deposited a sum of Rs. 25052/- on 5.10.1990. Mr. Ajay Kansal, Advocate appearing for the revisionist has strenuously urged that as emanates from the evidence produced in defence, the revisionist remained at rest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and on leave from .7.1990 to 30.11.1990, which leave no scope for doubt that he never remained on duty after 30.6.1990 and as its consequence, there was no occasion for him to sell the tickets. He further puts that he deposited Rs.25402/- as well as the unsold tickets in the office of the G.M. on .10.1990 and in turn, the latter had written a letter for withdrawal of the case and in these premises, no criminal offence is made out against the revisionist. He further submits that in view of the legal position laid down in re: State of Punjab vs. Amarjit Singh, 1992(1) Recent Criminal Reports, 619, the courts below have gravely erred in recording the conviction of the petitioner. The next argument raised by the counsel appearing for the revisionist is that the prosecution has utterly failed to prove by leading any evidence on the file that the tickets issued to the revisionist on 30.6.1990 [3] were sold by him and in the absence of the same, no criminal offence under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code is made out. He further added to it that as transpires from the evidence trickled from the respective mouths of the prosecution witnesses, the revisionist was not on duty and was on rest/leave from 1.7.1990 till 13.11.1990 and these circumstances lead to the only inference that after 30.6.1990 he never remained on duty. To tide over these submissions Mr. PS Sullar, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana has maintained that the said amount was deposited by the revisionist after registration of the case and as would be apparent from the evidence, revisionist got manipulated the sanction of his leave and thus, it would be going too far to say that the charged offence is not established against the revisionist. I have given a deep and thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions. In Amarjit Singh's case (supra), on 29.4.1982, Amarjit Singh, who was working as a Conductor in Pepsu Road Transport Corporation, (for short 'PRTC') absented himself from his duty with a sum of Rs.3254.55 of PRTC, Kapurthala. The case was got registered against him. The Division Bench of this Court was pleased to observe as under : After accepting the deposit of Rs. 2804/- from the respondent on August 17,1982, it does not lie in the mouth of Pepsu Road Transport Corporation to urge that the charge of criminal breach of trust against the accused in respect of allegedly misappropriated amount [4] still subsists. Regarding failure of the accused to return the unsold tickets it has been held by the Supreme Court in Sardar Singh vs. State of Haryana, AIR 1977 Supreme Court 1766 that merely failure or omission to return property does not constitute an offence under Section of the Indian Penal Code, Relevant observations read, what the section requires is something much more than mere failure or omission to return the receipt book, The prosecution has to go further and show that the appellant dishonestly misappropriated or converted the receipt book to his own use or dishonestly used or, disposed of it. That, we are afraid, the prosecution has not been able to do in the present case. We are, therefore, of the view that the appellant was wrongly convicted under Section 409. Finding of not guilty returned by the learned trial court is, therefore, affirmed. To my mind, the case in hand is manifestly covered by Amarjit Singh's case (supra). A glance through Ex.D1 would reveal that an amount of Rs. 25402/- was deposited by the revisionist on 5.10.1990 with the concerned authority of Haryana Roadways. As per Ex.D1/A the tickets box as well as the value of the sold tickets were deposited on the said date by the revisionist. As emerges out of Ex.D2, another order, earned leave was sanctioned for the period from 16.7.1990 to 13.11.1990 in favour of the [5] revisionist by the competent authority. As revealed by Ex.D4, he was on rest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and on leave from 5.7.1990 to 15.7.1990. This official record is a clincher towards the fact that the revisionist remained on rest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and thereafter he proceeded on earned leave which has been duly sanctioned by the competent authority. The prosecution has not adduced any cogent, convincing and clear evidence leading to the conclusion that right from 1.7.1990 onwards, he remained on duty and had sold the tickets of Bus fare. It is own evidence of the complainant in the form of above discussed documents that the revisionist was on rest/leave during the above mentioned period. If so, how he could be expected to have sold the tickets. It is probable that when the revisionist learnt about the registration of case against him, he on some advice deposited the amount of Rs.25402/- alongwith tickets to save his job. As already noticed, there is no evidence regarding sale of tickets by the revisionist. He could have sold the tickets only to the Bus passengers. The prosecution has not produced any evidence as to on which Bus he was a conductor when he sold tickets. The revisionist after registration of the case might had apprehended his suspension and arrest in the case. To get rid of the same he might have thought to return some tickets and cash in lieu of the other tickets. In re: Pushpa Kumar Rai v. State of Sikkim 1978 Criminal Law Journal, 1379, their Lordships were pleased to observe that even if it is assumed that the accused had collected the amount, the offence did not fall under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code which deals with breach of trust [6] by public servants and others. It was remarked as under:- In this case, therefore, even assuming that the accused was a conductor of the Bus of the Sikkim Nationalised Transport as alleged and in such capacity collected bus fares amounting to Rs. 2826.60p. as alleged or any other amount and failed to deposit the said amount, the accused can never be said to have been entrusted with that amount because the said amount was never 'made over' or 'transferred' or 'handed over', to the accused by anyone on behalf of the Sikkim Nationalised Transport. It also appears that in the charge itself the learned Sessions Judge did not state that the accused was entrusted with any amount but only stated that the accused was entrusted with collecting the bus fares . I am afraid that being entrusted with the doing of a job is not the same thing as being entrusted with any property within the meaning of S. 405 and other congnate Sections of the I.P.C. even though some money or other property may come into the hand of the person in the course of his doing such job. That being so, I am of the opinion that there was absolutely no material on record to frame a charge under S.409 against the accused. And if the charge framed was such as could not be framed on the materials on record, a plea of guilty to such a charge [7] is no plea in the eye of law and cannot be relied on by any Court, as the basis of any conviction. The learned Sessions Judge was, therefore, wrong in convicting the accused on the basis of his plea to the charge as framed by him and the order of conviction and sentence passed by him must, therefore, be set aside In re: Sardar Singh v. State of Haryana (1977) 1 Supreme Court Cases 463, their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court were pleased to observe as under: An essential ingredient of the offence under Section 405 is that the accused being in any manner entrusted with property or with dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own used that property or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust. Section 409 can be invoked only if it can be shown that the accused being in any manner entrusted with property or with dominion over property in his capacity as public servant committed criminal breach of trust in respect of that property. It requires something much more than mere failure or omission to return the property. [8] In the present case, the prosecution has not been able to show that the accused dishonestly misappropriated or converted the property to his own use or dishonestly used or disposed of it. Hence the conviction under Section 409 cannot stand. Reverting back to the facts of the instant case, the prosecution has not inducted any evidence to the effect that the revisionist had dishonestly misappropriated or converted the tickets to his own use or disposed of the alleged entrusted property in violation of any direction of law. There being dearth of such evidence, the offence is not established in view of the observations recorded in re: Sardar Singh's case (supra). In re: Harbhajan Lal vs. State of Punjab, 1984 (1) Recent Criminal Reports (Criminal) 567, the bus conductor had failed to return the unused tickets. The case under Section 409 of the Code was got registered against him. There was no evidence to the effect that the accused had sold the tickets and realized the amount. The Division Bench of this Court in these circumstances was pleased to hold that no case of misappropriation is made out unless there is a clear evidence that accused had realized the amount. Adverting to the facts of the current case, the defence evidence nullifies the prosecution case. Had the revisionist worked during the interregnum of 1.7.1990 to 13.11.1990, his rest/leave might had not been sanctioned. At the cost of repetition, it deserves to be pointed out here that, if he had worked on any Bus during the said period, the prosecution might had got proved the way bill of such Bus. Only then it",

Mr.PS Sullar, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana Harbans Lal, J. This revision is directed against the judgment dated 5.2.1992 rendered by the Court of Shri Darshan Singh, Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Hisar, whereby he convicted and sentenced the revision petitioner to undergo RI for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- or in default thereof to further undergo RI for a period one and half month, as well as judgment dated 8.7.1994 rendered by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Hisar vide which the period of substantive sentence inflicted by the learned trial Court has been reduced from 6 months rigorous imprisonment to three months rigorous imprisonment maintaining the amount of fine of Rs.1000/- as well as its default clause. As set up by the prosecution, the revisionist- Raghbir Singh is a bus conductor in the employment of Haryana Roadways and is posted in the Office of General Manager, Haryana Roadways, Hisar (hereinafter to be referred as the G.M. ). On 30.6.1990 he was entrusted with bus fare tickets of the value of Rs. 27584/- for being issued to the passengers. He did not deposit the tickets nor the sale proceeds thereof. Thereupon, the G.M. sent a letter Ex.PW3/A to S.H.O., Police Station City Hisar on [2] .7.1990. On its basis, FIR Ex.PW5/A was recorded. The revisionist was placed under suspension vide order dated 12.9.1990. He put in his appearance before the G.M. on 12.11.1990 and explained his absence from .7.1990 to 13.11.1990. The latter sanctioned earned leave to the revisionist for the aforesaid period vide order dated 21.11.1990 (copy Ex.D2) and ordered his reinstatement w.e.f. 14.11.1990.

Only then it\n\n[9] could have been inferred that he had the occasion to sell the tickets. Thus, the prosecution evidence falls short of proof regarding the sale of the tickets by the revisionist. The approach of a Court to very lightly brush aside the defence witnesses cannot be approved. After all they are also the witnesses who appear in the Court to prove the defence and make the statements on oath. The burden to prove the defence is not as heavy on the defence as it is on the prosecution. the prosecution is required to esatblish its case beyond every shadow of doubt, but the accused is only required to show to the Court that the defence raised by him may not be fool proof, but is probable and plausible. If the Court is of the opinion that the defence appears to be reasonable and probable, then the Court is not entitled to reject the statements of the witnesses. ( See Janggu alias Shobhit and others v. State of Madhya Pradesh, 2000 Criminal Law Journal 711 ). Coming to the facts of the case in hand, the defence evidence, as noted supra, in the form of documents is probable, plausible and reasonable. Rather, the same knocks down the prosecution edifice. Thus, placing abundant reliance upon the same, it is held that the prosecution case collapses like a house of cards and sequelly, this revision succeeds and is accepted, setting aside the judgments of the Courts below and the revisionist-petitioner is hereby acquitted of the charge. th October, 2007 (HARBANS LAL) gsv JUDGE",

The present petition filed under Articles 226/227 along with five connected petitions*, are directed against the land acquisition notification No. LAC(G)-88/97 dated 26.12.1988 under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act,1894 and the declaration vide notification No. LAC (G)/NTLA-89/150 dated .12.1989 under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, the ACT ). Before we deal with the notifications under challenge in these petitions, it would be apposite to narrate in brief a few material facts prior to the notification under challenge which have bearing on the present case as culled from CWP No.3550 of 1990- Risal Singh and others v. The State of Haryana and others. . On 4.11.1981, State Government had issued a notification under Section 4 for acquisition of land in dispute covering a total area of 812.12 acres which included the land of the petitioners and the petitioners in the connected petitions. The public purpose for that acquisition was to develop the land for residential area carving out Sectors 1, 2 and 3 at Rohtak. Subsequently, the declaration under Section 6 was issued on 24.2.1984. Since both the notifications were prior to the 1984 amendment of the Act, it was legal and valid then to issue a declaration under Section 6 up to 3 years from the date of Section 4 notification. It appears that the land owners then represented to the Chief Minister, Haryana against the acquisition. It is stated in para 7 of the petition that the Chief Minister had acceded to the request of the land owners and directed that the land on which residential buildings/houses of the petitioners had been constructed should not be acquired. This decision of the Chief Minister was conveyed to the Director, Town and Country Planning, Haryana who further conveyed the order to Director, Urban Estates, Haryana and the matter was dropped and Section 6 notification was allowed to lapse with effect from 23.9.1986 (P-3 dated 19.9.1986) with the condition that fresh notification under Section 4 may be issued after holding an inquiry in consultation with the District Town Planner following a meeting held on .7.1996. It was decided vide Annexure P-4 dated 24.9.1986 that if it is found that land lying vacant has been sold in the shape of plots and it does not fit in the planning of HUDA, in that case, it will be of no use to notify the same for acquisition. It was also a stipulation that a clear report be submitted as to how many houses had already been constructed in the area and to identify the owners of the lands which were then lying vacant. . Since no fresh notification was issued after lapse of the first acquisition the petitioners aver that they remained sanguine that their land would remain in their use and ownership and with that implied assurance many land owners raised further constructions on their land involving huge expenditure. This is where the first chapter of the story ends. . All of a sudden, State Government issued a fresh notification under Section 4 dated 26.12.1988 again setting in motion the process of acquisition of the land upon which large number of constructions in the shape of residential buildings existed. The petitioners filed objections under Section 5-A praying that their constructions be left out. It is stated that on the date of the second Section 4 notification for acquisition of 479.84 acres, there were approximately 300 built up houses in the area in question and that any move to acquire the land would resound in a humanitarian problem which would lead to enmass uprooting rural folk including the petitioners who had made the area their homestead prior to the notification under Section 4. The public purpose of the acquisition was to utilize the land for residential and commercial areas falling in Sector 3, Rohtak under the HUDA Act, 1977 by HUDA in the area of village Bohar HB 68 Tehsil and District Rohtak. The objections of the land owners including the petitioners did not find favour with the Land Acquisition Officer and the Section 6 notification came to be issued on 22.12.1988 declaring an area of 317.47 acres was required for acquisition in which the land/buildings of the petitioners fell. Since the notification under Section 4 of the Act was for 479.84 acres, the declaration under Section 6 was issued qua 317.47 Acres, therefore about 150 acres was left out of the acquisition. This lacuna was sought to be filled by the State Government by issuing a corrigendum notification dated 8.3.1990 where 317. 47 acres was increased to 367.47 acres. In this manner about 50 acres was added in which the land and houses of the petitioners was situated. In the affidavit filed by Satbir Singh, Land Acquisition Collector, Urban Estate, Haryana in compliance of this Court s order dated 11.7.2011, it has been stated that 33 land owners namely, Daya Singh and others had represented to the Director, Urban Estates on .3.1990 that their residential houses on the land owned by them if acquired would be to their detriment and cause undue hardship. The request of the land owners was approved by the Government on 17.4.1990. It has been further stated in the affidavit that a total land measuring 26.99 and 6.91 acres has been withdrawn under Section 48 of the Act vide notification dated 22.6.1990 and .4.1992 being the land which was notified under Section 6. In the affidavit, the details of Rectangle, Killa and Khasra numbers has been set out as also the name of persons whose land stood released after completion of the process of acquisition. It is relevant to notice that award No. 4 dated 29.3.1990 and award No.18 dated 25.3.1991 had come into existence. A map of the area has been annexed showing substantial area of 26.99 acres of land released on 17.4.1990 after passing of the awards left out after Section 5-A notification and the substantial area of 6.91 acres which was also released. The petitioner filed Civil Misc. No. 8701 of 2011 in the present proceedings pointing out that the area in question is by now a developed colony where various amenities stood provided by the respondent-authorities. It has been further pointed out that area of some land owners has been released who did not even choose to file objections under section 5-A. A letter of the Director, Urban Estates Department, Haryana to the Estate Officer, HUDA dated 27.8.1983 has been placed on record (P-13) that 4 marlas of land comprised in Khasra No. 173//9/2 had been decided to be released as there was construction of Samadhi, Havan Kund, Piao and Sat Sang Hall on the land. Another letter dated 17.3.1988 (P14) of the District Town Planner, Rohtak to State Town Planner, Hissar deals with a request of 68 residents of the disputed area in Sector 3 who had represented to the Minister, Town and Country Planning Department, Haryana consequent upon which the matter was studied and a detailed report is contained in this letter. It was reported that the constructions of the 68 land owners was not in a compact block but in different khasra numbers, that is, approximately in all the khasra numbers and the adjoining area had already been released from acquisition by HUDA. It has been noticed that this area in question is also under writ proceedings since long and no lay out plan of this area had been drawn. Therefore, a recommendation was made to the Government to consider release of land from acquisition. A similar request was recommended for release vide letter dated .6.2006 (P15) from District Town Planner, Rohtak to the Administrator, HUDA, Hissar for release of land of one Shri Surat Singh Nandal. . Mr. Arun Jain learned Senior Counsel unfolded before us the facts of the case and argued that this was eminently a fit case for quashing the impugned notifications under sections 4 and 6 of the Act. He brought to our notice the contents of para 14 of the writ petition, which read as under:- That subsequently a large parcel of land which was covered under residential houses could not be utilized for planned development of Sector 3 was left out. This land included the land of the petitioners mentioned above. A notification was prepared in the office and was sent for publication to the Government Press. Under this notification, land measuring 317.47 acres of land was to be acquired and to be included in the Section of the Act's notification. However, for extraneous and irrational reasons, the notification sent for publication was recalled by the respondents and .3 acres of additional land was added with pen on the notification to be sent for publication to the press. The area sought to be acquired reflected in Section 6 notification, therefore, increased to .50 acres but since the numbers were subsequently added, as such, the notification still reflects area in acres in column No.4 as .47 Acres. . In the written statement filed by Mr. R.K. Kazal, Land Acquisition Collector, Urban Estates, Haryana, Hissar on behalf of the respondent-State, there is a damaging admission, which reads as follows:- That para No.14 of the writ petition is wrong and hence denied. It is submitted that the total acquired land under Section 6 was 367.50 acres but it was wrongly published the area 317.47 acres which was rectified vide corrigendum No. LAC(G)-90/NTLA/187 dated .3.90. It is further submitted that those khasra numbers measuring land 50.3 acres were not typed and were added with pen. . In the circumstances, we called for the original record of the notification under Section 6 dated 22.12.1989. On perusal of the original record, we were confronted with numerous hand written entries of khasra numbers which are undated and unsigned. On the last page on the left margin of the notification it is only the typed part which is signed by the Joint Secretary to Government of Haryana, Urban Estates Department Haryana, Chandigarh. Learned senior counsel submitted that the land of his clients was roped in into acquisition by this illegal and unlawful process. Government can speak only in writing, formally and by notifications. The land acquisition law being ex-proprietary, it deserves strict construction. We find merit in the submission and the view canvassed by him is legally sound that the notification under section 6 deserves to be quashed. . Mr. Kamal Sehgal, learned Additional Advocate General, Haryana was at a loss to explain the authenticity and genuineness of the hand written khasra/khewat numbers on the left margin of the notification or who was its author. . Mr. Arun Jain learned Senior Advocate read the substantive provision contained in Section 6 of the Act that when any particular land is needed for a public purpose, declaration shall be made to that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such Government or of some officer duly authorized to certify its orders. The hand written parts on the last page of the notification does not stand the test of Section 6 and cannot be taken as a part of it, especially when no corresponding noting regarding insertion of Khasra numbers in question have been produced signed by the Secretary or any authorized delegate of the Government. The precious rights of land owners cannot be defeated by sleight of hand. Learned senior counsel next argued that the lands of similarly situated land owners were released from time to time and at least up to 2005 and that therefore, discrimination was writ large and there was infraction of Article 14. He relied upon a recent judgment rendered by the Hon ble Supreme Court in Hari Ram Versus State of Haryana and others reported in (3) SCC 621 where the test of non discrimination has been introduced into the law of land acquisition in respect of State Government s power under Section of the Act to release certain lands from acquisition. The land owners who are similarly situated have right of similar treatment by the State Government in respect of the same acquisition proceedings. The facts in Hari Ram s case (supra) are somewhat similar to the facts of the present case. We may quote with profit para No.24 of the judgment which reads as under:- As a matter of fact, lands of more than 40 landowners out of the same acquisition proceedings have been released by the State Government under Section 48 of the Act. Some of the release orders have been passed in respect of landowners who had not challenged the acquisition proceedings and some of them had challenged the acquisition proceedings before the High Court and whose cases were not recommended by Joint Inspection Committee for withdrawal from acquisition and whose writ petitions were dismissed. Some of these landowners had only vacant plots of land and there was no construction at all. In most of these cases, the award has been passed and, thereafter, the State Government has withdrawn from acquisition. It is not the case of the respondents that withdrawal from acquisition in favour of such landowners has been in violation of any statutory provision or contrary to law. It is also not their case that the release of land from acquisition in favour of such landowners was wrong action on their part or it was done due to some mistake or a result of fraud or corrupt motive. There is nothing to even remotely suggest that the persons whose lands have been released have derived the benefit illegally. As noticed above, prior to October 26, 2007, the State Government did not have uniform policy concerning withdrawal from acquisition. As regards the guidelines provided in the letter dated June 26, , this Court has already held that classification on the basis of nature of construction cannot be validly made and such policy is not based on intelligible differentia and a rational basis. What appears from the available material is that for release of the lands under the subject acquisition, no policy has been adhered to. This leads to an irresistible conclusion that no firm policy with regard to release of land from acquisition existed. It is true that any action or order contrary to law does not confer any right upon any person for similar treatment. It is equally true that a landowner whose land has been acquired for public purpose by following the prescribed procedure cannot claim as a matter of right for release of his/her land from acquisition but where the State Government exercises its power under Section 48 of the Act for withdrawal from acquisition in respect of a particular land, the landowners who are similarly situated have right of similar treatment by the State Government. Equality of citizens' rights is one of the fundamental pillars on which edifice of rule of law rests. All actions of the State have to be fair and for legitimate reasons. The Government has obligation of acting with substantial fairness and consistency in considering the representations of the landowners for withdrawal from acquisition whose lands have been acquired under the same acquisition proceedings. The State Government cannot pick and choose some landowners and release their land from acquisition and deny the same benefit to other landowners by creating artificial distinction. Passing different orders in exercise of its power under Section 48 of the Act in respect of persons similarly situated relating to same acquisition proceedings and for same public purpose is definitely violative of Article 14 of the Constitution and must be held to be discriminatory. More so, it is not even the case of the respondents that release of land from acquisition. The above principles have been further elaborated by the Hon ble Supreme Court in its landmark judgment in Bondu Ramasawamy and others Versus Bangalore Development Authority and others (2010)7 SCC 129. A road map has been laid down for State Government and development authorities and the principles to follow in acquiring land under the Act and that the prevailing system of acquisition of land needs an overhaul. To begin with, there is absence of proper or adequate survey and planning before embarking upon acquisition; notifying areas to start with far larger than what is required for acquisition and then making arbitrary deletions and withdrawals from acquisition. The four other vital areas delineated in the judgment which have been identified where government would have to step in, are not being referred to here as those issues do not arise in the present case. Mr. Arun Jain has also sought to buttress his argument against the acquisition by pointing out that there was no development plan or survey done at the initial stage to rope in substantial constructions of the petitioners made prior to notification under Section 4. He relied upon a Division Bench judgment of this Court sounding the clarion call to all the Land Acquisition Collectors and officers of the Town and Country Planning Department and other statutory bodies like HUDA and HSIIDC to make comprehensive surveys before sending proposal to the Government before issuing notifications under Section 4 of the Act. The relevant part reads as under:- The respondent State of Haryana is directed to issue comprehensive instructions to all the Land Acquisition Collectors of the State, Officers of the Town and Country Planning Department, various agencies like HUDA, HSIIDC or others to undertake a comprehensive survey before sending the proposal to the Government for issuance of notifications under Section 4 of the Act. The concerned officers are to ensure that clause 2 of the policy of the State, dated .10.2007 for releasing the structures, which have been built up prior to issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act are not included in the proposal for acquisition. Such instructions would bring proximity between law, life and justice which look to be distant neighbours in the present scenario. It would avoid unnecessary harassment to the general public who might have constructed small houses on the land proposed to be acquired. It would also discourage the construction activity after issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act or the tendency of some unscrupulous element to claim that the building was constructed prior to issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act. These steps in turn would reduce the disputes between the general public and the State paving the way for developing peaceful society and avoiding litigation. . On the issue of discrimination as well the lands and buildings of the petitioners deserve to be protected by the manner in which lands of similarly situated landowners was released after acquisition in 1988, after coming into existence of awards of 1990 and from time to time even after 15 years till 2005. We see no useful public purpose will be served in upholding the notifications at this distance of time particularly when the petitioners have had the protection of interim orders of this court staying dispossession. We would confirm those orders. . In view of the above discussion and drawing strength from the aforesaid judgments, we hold that the impugned notifications under Sections 4 and 6 deserve to be quashed. We order accordingly. . This writ petition and the connected writ petitions are allowed and the impugned notifications under Sections 4 and 6 are quashed qua the petitioners.\n\n(M.M.KUMAR) (RAJIV NARAIN RAINA) ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\n\nJUDGE\n\nNovember 9th,2011 nk * Serial No. Civil Writ Petition No. Title of 1990 Risal Singh and others v.

Wasu, Advocate, for Municipal Committees. Mr.Raj Kumar Gupta,Advocate,for respondents in CWP No.14349 of 1992. Mr.Arun Palli, Senior Advocate, with Mr.Tushar Sharma, Advocate, for respondents in CWP No.15048 of 1992. PERMOD KOHLI, J. (Oral): Since common questions of law and facts are involved in these writ petitions, the same are disposed of by this common order. The petitioners in all these cases are aggrieved of the enhancement of the rental value of the premises which has been made the basis for assessment of the house tax. The petitioners have relied upon Section 62 of the Punjab Municipal Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act ) to challenge the assessment. From the bare reading of Section 62 of the Act aforesaid, it is evident that this section applies where assessment is to be made for the first time. In the present cases, the properties are already assessed for the purposes of payment of House Tax and it is only the order of enhancement of the House Tax which has been impugned in these petitions. Learned counsel for the respondents has, however, taken the shelter of Section 67 of the Act. Section 67 of the Act permits reassessment or revision of the assessment under the circumstances indicated therein which, inter-alia, includes the erroneous assessment on account of mistake, fraud etc. The present cases do not fall in any of the conditions. However, Section 65 of the Act deals with revision of the assessment list, but this requires a public notice. Admittedly, no public CWP No.7331 of 1988 :3: noticed has been issued. Apart from the above, the respondents have assessed the rental value without any parameters being adopted, primarily on the grounds that adjoining premises is fetching a particular amount as rent. The issue relating to the assessment of the rental value has been considered by the Apex Court in Dewan Daulat Rai Kapoor etc. etc. Vs. New Delhi Municipal Committee and another etc. etc., AIR 1980, Supreme Court, 54, wherein the following observations have been made:- 11. .................We are, therefore, of the view that, even if the standard rent has not been fixed by the Controller, the landlord cannot reasonably expect to receive from a hypothetical tenant anything more than the standard rent determinable under the Act and this would be so equally whether the building has been let out to a tenant who has lost his right to apply for fixation of the standard rent or the building is self-occupied by the owner. The assessing authority would, in either case, have to arrive at its own figure of the standard rent by applying principles laid down in the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 for determination of standard rent and determine the annual value of the building on the basis of such figure of standard rent. Admittedly, in all these cases it is alleged by the petitioners that CWP No.7331 of 1988 :4: the premises are governed by the Rent Legislation and in view of the dictum of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court, the rental value could be as is being received by the landlord or where there is no such material, the fair rent being payable under Section 3 (1) (b) of the Act, is applicable. In view of the above circumstances, the impugned orders are unsustainable in law and are liable to be set aside. I order accordingly. Consequently, the maters are remitted back to the Municipal Committees concerned for reassessment of the rental value in accordance with the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court mentioned above. The concerned Municipal Committees will pass fresh orders after affording opportunity of being heard to the petitioners. With these observations the writ petitions are disposed of. The parties through their counsel are directed to appear before the concerned Municipal Committees on 01.09.2009 for further proceedings.

Briefly, the facts are that the Government of Haryana, Urban Estate Department, issued a notification dated 2.8.1989 under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') proposing to acquire 194.97 acres of land situated in the revenue estate of village Mewla Maharajpur, Hadbast No.4, Tehsil Ballabgarh, District -5- Faridabad, for development and utilization of the notified land as residential and commercial purposes in Sector 45 of Faridabad under the Haryana Urban Development Authority Act, 1977. Almost all the petitioners in the writ petitions submitted their objections under Section 5-A of the Act. The appropriate Government, on consideration of the same, did not accept all the objections leading to the issuance of a notification under Section 6 of the Act on 1.8.1990 wherein a declaration was issued for acquisition of 184.66 acres of land meaning thereby that 10.31 acres of land was exempted from acquisition. Thereafter, notice under Section 9 of the Act was served on the petitioners on 15.1.1991 leading to the filing of the above-mentioned writ petitions praying therein for release of the constructed houses of the petitioners as had been released qua others for example residential houses constructed in Khasra No.14, 15/1 and 15/2 of rectangle No.50 as also of Chhote Lal and others, who have built their houses on the land comprising khasra No.22/2 of rectangle No.49. Houses constructed by Jamal and others on khasra No.18 of rectangle No.42 have also been exempted from acquisition. The petitioners have contended that they are similarly situated and have their built up houses in the same vicinity, but they have been discriminated against, thereby leading to violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. It has been pleaded that their objections have been wrongly rejected whereas the objections of similarly placed persons have been accepted and their residential houses have been released while the houses of the petitioners which are their only residential houses have been acquired. Accordingly, the petitioners have prayed for quashing of notifications dated 2.8.1989 and 1.8.1990 issued under Sections 4 and 6 of the Act respectively, as well as notice dated 15.1.1991 issued under Section -6- of the Act. State of Haryana has contested the claim of the petitioners; however, in reply to the assertions made by the petitioners with regard to the release of residential houses of similarly placed persons, no specific denial has been made of the assertions, except for that of Jamal and others as it has been stated that they had filed a writ petition in this Court but it has not been averred about any stay granted by this Court or the stage of the case. As regards the construction in some of the cases, the factum of there being C- class construction before issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act, has been admitted, while in some cases it has been pleaded that the acquired land which was having construction on it stands released. In some other cases, it has been stated that there was no construction on the land at the time of issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act. In two of the writ petitions, no reply has been filed wherein the petitioners have asserted that they have constructed their houses before the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act. It would not be out of way to mention here that the respondents have simply pleaded in the reply that the land of the petitioners has been acquired in accordance with the Act but it has not been pleaded that by exempting the land of the petitioners or releasing the same from acquisition, the purpose of the Land Acquisition Act would stand frustrated. Counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners have with great difficulty constructed their residential houses in the land in question and have no other residential houses. If the petitioners are uprooted from the land at this stage, especially when residential houses of -7- similarly placed persons in the same vicinity stand exempted from acquisition while issuing notification under Section 6 of the Act, they would be rendered homeless. The petitioners also deserve the same treatment and are entitled to the said benefit. The respondents cannot be allowed to discriminate the petitioners without assigning any distinction between the claim of the petitioners and other similarly placed persons qua the same nature of land and structures. They further contend that the residential houses of the petitioners would in no manner impinge upon or infringe the object and purpose of acquisition, as the land is intended to be acquired for the purpose of residential and commercial development and utilization. They further contend that the writ petitions be allowed and the residential houses along with the land be exempted from acquisition. On the other hand, counsel for the respondents submits that the Government is entitled to acquire the land as well as built up houses. There is no bar with regard to acquisition of residential houses. All provisions as contained under the Land Acquisition Act have been fully complied with. On acquisition of the residential houses and the land of the petitioners, they would be paid adequate compensation in accordance with law and, therefore, they cannot make a grouse in this regard. He has, however, not been able to distinguish the claim of the petitioners for release of their residential houses, in any manner vis-a-vis. the houses of the land owners who have built up their residential houses in khasra Nos.14, 15/1 and 15/2 of rectangle No.50 as also Chhote Lal and others, who have built up their houses on the land comprising khasra No.2 of rectangle No.49, whose land has been exempted from notification under Section 6 of the Act. -8- We have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. The above-mentioned writ petitions require to be put in four different categories for proper consideration and effective decision of these cases. The first category cases are those wherein the petitioners have asserted that they had constructed their residential houses before the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act, which fact has been admitted by the respondents in their written statement. These writ petitions are C.W.P.Nos.1593, 1906, 1992, 1706, 1887, 2034 and 1929 of . Out of these cases, in some of the writ petitions, it has been asserted by the respondents that some rooms have been built up after the issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act by the petitioners. The second category of cases are those wherein it has been asserted by the petitioners that they had constructed their residential houses before the issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act but no written statement has been filed by the respondents. These are C.W.P.Nos.2036 and 1863 of 1991. The third category of cases would be cases where the factum of construction of the houses before issuance of the notification under Section of the Act has been admitted by the respondents. However, it has been stated that the constructed area stood already released. C.W.P.Nos.1994, and 1705 of 1991 belong to this category. The fourth category are the cases where although it has been asserted by the petitioners in their writ petitions that they had constructed their residential houses before the issuance of the notification under Section -9- of the Act but in the written statement filed by the State of Haryana, it has been asserted that there was no construction on the land when notification under Section 4 of the Act was issued. C.W.P.Nos.1704 of 1991, C.W.P.No.1905 of 1991 and C.W.P.No.2166 of 1991 are the cases in this category. In none of the cases, replication has been filed by the petitioners and, therefore, the facts as mentioned by the respondents in their written statement have not been controverted by the petitioners. There can be no dispute with regard to the assertion made by the counsel for the respondents that not only the land but also the structures on the land can be acquired under the Act. However, the decision of the State Government in not granting exemption from acquisition or releasing the land of a land owner arbitrarily and resorting to discriminatory approach qua similarly placed and situated land, would violate Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The case in hand is not the one where it is either the assertion of the petitioners or of the State Government that the exemption which has been granted to the similarly placed land owners, whose residential houses have been released from notification under Section 6 on consideration of the objections filed under Section 5-A of the Act, is in violation of the provisions of the Act or contrary to law with a mala fide intention to provide any benefit to those persons; neither is it a case where due to some mistake or result of a fraud or corrupt method, the land of the land owners has been exempted from notification. There is nothing, even remote to suggest that the land owners whose residential houses have been released have derived the benefit illegally. In such circumstances, the land owners, who are similarly -10- situated, have a right to receive similar treatment by the State Government. They cannot be discriminated against. All actions of the State have to be fair and for legitimate reasons. The State Government cannot pick and choose some land owners and exempt their land from acquisition and deny the same benefit to other similarly situated land owners. In the present case, the respondent-State has failed to give any explanation, what to say of reasonable one, with regard to the allegations of discrimination qua the residential houses of similarly placed land-owners. The specific pleadings in the writ petitions, mentioning the names of land owners, khasra and rectangle numbers whose residential houses in the same vicinity and area have been exempted/released from acquisition have not been denied by the respondents. Nor any reasons have been assigned for not releasing/exempting the land of the petitioners where their residential houses exist. This apparently leads to the conclusion that the respondent- State had not acted fairly and has discriminated with regard to the petitioners. It is also not the case of the respondents that the release of residential houses of the petitioners would frustrate the purpose of acquisition. It would not be out of way to mention here that the purpose of acquisition of the land is for residential and commercial development and utilization and what is being sought to be exempted by the petitioners are their only residential houses. A plea has been raised by the respondents that the rooms which have been constructed by the petitioners in most of the cases are of C-class construction whereas in some of the cases the same is of B-Class as well. However, that would not be relevant as the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sube Singh and others vs.",

It would not be out of way to mention here that the purpose of acquisition of the land is for residential and commercial development and utilization and what is being sought to be exempted by the petitioners are their only residential houses. A plea has been raised by the respondents that the rooms which have been constructed by the petitioners in most of the cases are of C-class construction whereas in some of the cases the same is of B-Class as well. However, that would not be relevant as the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sube Singh and others vs.\n\nState of\n\nHaryana and others, (2001) 7 SCC 545 has held that the class of -11- construction on the land of land-owners to be taken into consideration for release or exemption from acquisition is not based on intelligible differentia and a rationale basis germane to the purpose. Accordingly, the class of construction does not make a difference for considering exemption from acquisition. As has been held above, the respondent-State has discriminated qua the petitioners in cases where the residential houses were in existence prior to the issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act. Accordingly, cases falling in category No.1 i.e. C.W.P.Nos.1593, 1906, , 1706, 1887, 2034 and 1929 of 1991 are allowed. Direction is issued to the respondents in these cases to release the land of the petitioners from acquisition to the extent occupied by the structures which were used for residential purpose only on the date of issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act along with equal open area for the beneficial enjoyment of the petitioners from their land. It is clarified here that land under the constructed area not being used for residential purpose strictly i.e. for purposes subservient to agriculture like tube-well, cattle shed, fodder store/shed, dairy farming, poultry farming etc. shall not be treated as released as it would violate and not fit in the purpose of acquisition. As regards category No.2 i.e. C.W.P.Nos.2036 and 1863 of , since no reply has been filed by the respondents, a direction is issued to the respondents to verify the claim of the petitioners and if it is found as per the records that there were constructed residential houses before the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act, directions as issued in category No.1 cases shall apply. -12- As regards category No.3 i.e.C.W.P.Nos.1994, 1886 and 1705 of 1991, these writ petitions deserve to be dismissed on the ground that the constructed area of the residential houses stand already released and, therefore, no directions with regard to the land to the extent occupied by the structures is required to be issued. However, in case equal open area abutting the structure has not been released for the beneficial enjoyment of the petitioners, the same shall be released by the respondents from the land of the petitioners. However, directions issued in the above categories of cases shall not come in the way of the Authorities in removing the structures, if the same is required for roads, hospitals or other civic amenities or common sites or public utility areas as per the lay-out plan. The respondents shall try as far as possible to retain the structures unless it becomes difficult for them to have a planned development without removing them. It would also be open to the Authorities to make adjustments or re-adjustments of plots for the purpose of planned development and in case it becomes necessary to give an additional area to the petitioners, the petitioners shall be bound to take the additional area and also be bound to pay cost for such area, as is chargeable to other allottees. The petitioners shall also be bound to pay the development charges as is charged from the other allottees. The afore-stated directions be complied with by the respondents within a period of four months from today. Till then, interim order in their favour shall continue to operate. As regards category No.4 i.e.C.W.P.Nos.1704, 1905 and of 1991, these are the cases where specific stand of the -13- respondents is that there was no construction on the land in question when notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was issued No replication having been filed by the petitioners, the averment made by the respondents is taken to be correct and, therefore, the petitioners cannot claim discrimination qua the constructed residential houses of others. Accordingly, their writ petitions deserve to be dismissed. Ordered accordingly. Photostat copy of this order be placed in the other connected cases.\n\n( JASBIR SINGH ) ( AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH ) JUDGE JUDGE August 03rd , 2010 poonam Whether referred to Reporters? Yes/No.",

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mr. R.K.Battas and Mr. R.D.Gupta, Advocates\n\nfor the appellant. Mr. Mehardeep Singh, Assistant Advocate General, Punjab, for the State. Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia, J. (Oral)\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997 has been preferred by Rajinder Singh who was nominated as accused in case FIR No. 27 dated 6.6.1994 registered at Police Station Amloh under Sections 307 read with Section 34 IPC. Appellant was tried along with his wife Balbir Kaur and learned Additional Sessions Judge, Fatehgarh Sahib, acquitted his wife and held him guilty under Section 307 IPC and sentenced him to undergo five years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.2,000/-. In default of payment of fine, he was further ordered to undergo four months rigorous imprisonment.\n\nLearned trial Court has held that the appellant has caused injuries to Baljit Singh with a gatra kirpan on the right side of chest of the victim and the chest injury was declared dangerous to life. Baljit Singh injured remained admitted in C.M.C. Ludhiana. On 4.6.1994, he was medicolegally examined by Dr.A.Joseph and the following injuries were found on his person:- 1. cm long incised wound on his right side chest anteriorly in 6th intercostal space about 10 cm from midline communicating with plaural cavity, bleeding was present; . cm long incised wound left side chest anterior-lateral aspect about 13 cm from midline in 5th of intercostal space minimum bleeding was present; . .5 cm long incised wound left side chest anteriorly about 10 cm from midline in 7th intercostal space minimum bleeding was present; . cm long incised wound left side of chest laterally about 21 cm from midline subcutaneous tissue was deep, minimal bleeding was present; AND . cm long incised wound left elbow posteriorly subcutaneous tissue deep, minimal bleeding was present . Baljit Singh injured, appeared as PW.3. He has reiterated the version given by him in the FIR. Briefly stated, Baljit Singh PW.3 has stated that appellant Rajinder Singh along with his wife Balbir Kaur came in the hutment in the fields. They raised objection as the water seepage used to go to the fields of accused. It is further stated that Balbir Kaur caught hold of him from his leg and Rajinder Singh caught hold him from his arms and thereafter Rajinder Singh took out his gatra kirpan and gave three blows on the left flank, which caused injuries on the ribs of Baljit Singh, complainant. It was stated that the motive for the occurrence was a land dispute regarding partition of land. Baljit Singh was thoroughly cross-examined. The defence failed to cause any dent in his testimony. Baljit Singh, PW.3, was corroborated by the testimony of Malkiat Singh, PW.4.\n\nIt has been stated before me that no reliance should be placed by this Court on the testimony of Baljit Singh, PW.3 and Malkiat Singh, PW.4 as they are interested witnesses and no independent witness has been examined. It has been further contended that there are material discrepancies, contradictions and improvements in the testimony of the witnesses, therefore, they suffer from blemish. It has been further stated that there is a delay of 30 hours in lodging of FIR and, therefore, the prosecution case should be disbelieved. Having heard Mr. R.K.Battas, I am of the considered opinion that these arguments in itself are not sufficient to return acquittal of the appellant. As far as the delay is concerned, benefit has already been given to the wife of appellant. Baljit Singh is an injured witness. His presence at the spot is stamped. He will be the last person to substitute or falsely implicate any other person as accused. Accused and witnesses belong to the same village. Furthermore, testimony of the witnesses is fully corroborated by the medical evidence and the investigating agency has examined the spot. Therefore, on this ground, I am afraid, sole accused cannot be acquitted when the injured had taken a definite stand against him in the witness box.\n\nIn the alternate, Mr. Battas has contended that in the present case occurrence pertains to year 1994 and a period of 14 years is going to lapse and protracted trial in itself should be construed as mitigating circumstance. It is further contended that the parties are residents of same village and sending the appellant behind the bars at this stage may not disrupt peace, amity and cordial relations prevailing between the parties. At the same time, this Court is conscious of the fact that the injuries given were very serious. Victim remained in C.M.C. Ludhiana and the treatment given to him as revealed by the doctor, in his statement, does not entitle the appellant to reduction of sentence to already undergone especially when the appellant has only undergone two months and ten days. Taking totality of circumstances into view, ends of justice will be fully met in case sentence of appellant is reduced from five years to two and a half years and fine is increased to Rs.20,000/- and the fine be deposited within three months. Fine so deposited, be disbursed to the injured. In case the fine is not deposited then the appellant shall undergo six months in default.\n\nWith these observations, the present appeal is disposed off.\n\n(Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\nJudge March 18, 2008\n\nDK",

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA. Present: Mr. A.P. Bhandari, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. Satish Bhanot, Senior Deputy Advocate General, Punjab, for the respondent. Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia, J. (Oral)\n\nThe present petitioner has raised two fold submissions in the present writ petition. It was stated by the petitioner that he joined as Octroi Superintendent in the Municipal committee, Malerkotla, in August . The petitioner submitted that he has working in Class-I Municipalities. At the time when Punjab Municipal Service (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules ) were enforced, there were 12 posts of Executive Officers of Class-I. Later on 14 more posts were created. Thus, there were 26 posts of Executive Officers of Class-I. The petitioner has raised grievance against the advertisement dated 30.9.1987 issued by the State of Punjab for filling up nine posts of Executive Officers of Class-I for the State of Punjab through direct recruitment. Petitioner stated that since he acquired experience, the action of respondent-Punjab State is bad in issuing interview letters to the persons for appointment as Executive Officers in Municipal Committees Grade-I by way of direct recruitment.\n\nAn affidavit was submitted by the Under Secretary to the Government of Punjab in which it was stated that as per the 1975 Rules, nine posts of Executive Officers of Class-I in the State are to be filled up by way of direct recruitment in accordance with the Rules. It is stated that six persons were absorbed as Executive Officers in Class-I Municipal Committees in terms of Rule 5(1) of the above said Rules and as per Rules, 50% vacancies are to be filled up by way of direct recruitment and 50% vacancies are to be filled up by promotion on seniority-cum-merit basis. Mr. Bhanot has very categorically stated that the petitioner has retired. Second grievance made in the present writ petition is that petitioner had discharged his duties as Executive Officer of Class-I in Class-I Municipal Committees in his own pay scale, therefore, he is entitled to be paid salary as per the scale which were admissible to the Executive Officer Class-I. Petitioner has stated that since he had discharged his duties as Executive Officers Class-I the maxim of Equal Pay for Equal Work has to operate in his favour and State is bound to pay the salary to him as the Executive Officer Grade-I. In reply filed, it has been submitted that till the direct recruits were to be appointed on the administrative ground, petitioner as Executive Officers Class-II was asked to discharge duties as Executive Officer Grade-I. It has been stated that petitioner was neither appointed as Executive Officers Class-I by way of direct recruitment nor by way of promotion. If due to the exigencies of situation, an employee, till the new incumbent arrived, working in a lower grade is asked to discharge duties on a similar post having a higher grade as a stop gap arrangement, he cannot claim that he should be paid salary according to the higher grade. Mr. Bhanot states that later all the petitioner was promoted as Executive Officer Class-I. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon Smt. P. Grover v. State of Haryana 1983(2) Services Law Reporter 734, in which it was held that where a person is promoted and is paid lower scale that cannot be sustained. This judgment is of no help to the petitioner to the present writ petition as in the present case there was no promotional order of the petitioner. He was to only discharge duties till the direct incumbents were appointed. Petitioner was Executive Officer of Municipal Committee Grade-II, simply because he was discharging the same duties in Municipal Committee Grade-I, it will not be held that he was discharging the duties of a post which carried some onerous responsibility. Similarly, the other two judgments rendered in Anand Parkash v. State of Punjab 2005(3) Recent Services Judgments 749 and judgment rendered by learned Single Bench of this Court in Satish Kumar and Others v. State of Haryana (Civil Writ Petition No. 8615 of 1991 decided on 20.10.1993) are of no help to the petitioner as in Satish Kumar's cas (supra), petitioner was not considered for promotion. In the present case, post was meant for direct recruits. Since the petitioner was not discharging duties of higher responsibility, therefore, he is not entitled to the relief sought.\n\nMr. Bhanot states that at the relevant time, services rendered in Municipal Committee Grade-I was provincial service and the petitioner was to be selected to become member of Municipal Committee Grade-I. He cannot claim that he should be paid the salary which is due to the Executive Officer discharging the duties of Municipal Grade-I.\n\nIt has been consistently considered and held by this Court that only a regular selection by way of advertisement or from requisition made from the Employment Exchange shall vest right in the incumbent. A person like petitioner discharging duties will not be entitled to the benefit of scale prevailing for that post.\n\nHence, there is no merit in the present petition, same is dismissed.

It is not disputed that when the petitioner applied for study leave, there was no policy governing the conditions thereof. Leave was granted to the petitioner to pursue the course on the execution of an affidavit from him wherein he mentioned as follows :- C.W.P\n\n::2:: 1. That all the expenses would have to bear by me. . That I will serve the Board for a period of 2 years after acquiring higher qualification. . That I will not claim any benefit except those given by the Board from time to time as a result of higher qualification. . That for study period I will apply leave which will be at liberty of the Board for consideration on merit. Subsequently, the respondents formulated a policy to govern the conditions for grant of paid study leave. Condition No.1 thereof was to the following effect :- i) The candidate seeking admission in the Degree Course should have atleast 5 years Regular Service in the Board. Since on the date of applying, the petitioner did not qualify the above mentioned condition, his prayer was declined. At that stage, the petitioner filed CWP No.12431 of 1989, which was disposed of with a direction to the respondents to pass a speaking order. Even in the speaking order dated 12.1.1990, it has been mentioned that since the petitioner does not fulfill the essential qualification of having 5 years regular service, the benefit of paid leave cannot be granted to him. The case of another person which was relied upon by the petitioner was distinguished on the ground that such person had five years service to his credit. Counsel for the petitioner has laid stress particularly on para 3 of the policy which is to the following effect :- 3. The above decision of the Board would also be applicable to the officials, who have joined a regular course. As per the counsel for the petitioner, under para 3 the petitioner would be covered, since he had already joined the regular course. However, counsel for the respondents states that the said para 3 C.W.P\n\n::3:: would be applicable to those officials who may have joined prior to the policy and fulfilled the condition and that it would not enure to the benefit of the petitioner. In my opinion, the argument of counsel for the respondents has to be accepted. It cannot be lost sight of that on the date the petitioner applied, there was no provision for grant of paid study leave. The petitioner was granted study leave on the basis of the affidavit sworn by him. In the circumstances, he cannot be held to be entitled to the benefit of the policy. Counsel for the petitioner has further argued that since the predominant factor of the policy is that study leave benefits not only the employee but the employer also, such a pedantic interpretation should not be given. He has laid stress particularly on the fact that since the passing of the course, the petitioner has been in service of the respondents and, thus, the benefit of his acquiring higher professional qualification has definitely enriched his job profile. He further states that even in the policy, the safeguard incorporated by the respondents is that the person will undertake to serve the respondents for a period of five years after finishing the Course (so that due benefit of his higher qualification can be derived by the respondents). As per the learned counsel, the petitioner has been in service of the Board throughout and, thus, he has fulfilled the condition of not only five years service but more than two decades of service. In my opinion, this argument of counsel for the petitioner would not be the determinative, as the Court is mindful of the fact that the condition to which the petitioner subjected himself was only two years service. As per his affidavit, he could have left the service after two years C.W.P\n\n::4:: and the respondents could have raised no grievance against it. Counsel for the petitioner has further argued that para 3, quoted above, makes it clear that the condition of five years service is only prospective in nature and cannot be retrospectively applied to those persons who have already availed the benefit. He has also argued that once the name of the petitioner was sponsored he could not be denied the benefit. As regards the first argument, it cannot be accepted for the simple reason that prior to the policy there was no provision relating to the grant of paid study leave. Thus, there is no question of adjustment or any retrospectivity to this stipulation. As regards the second argument, the same can be disposed of by observing that right to unpaid study leave is totally different to the right of paid study leave and merely because the petitioner had been sponsored for study leave, which at that time could not be paid study leave (for want of any policy in this regard), it did not entitle him to claim right that his sponsorship was under the new policy. Consequently, finding no merit in this writ petition, the same is dismissed with no order as to costs.\n\n( AJAY TEWARI ) November 29, 2010. JUDGE `kk'",

(ORAL) Prayer in the present writ petition is for issuance of a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the respondents-State of Haryana to give the benefit of revision of pay scale to the petitioner as given to the HCMS (Doctors) and Engineers vide notification dated 02.06.1989 (Annexure P-1). It is the claim of the petitioner that he was appointed on the post of Transport Officer in the Department of Health, Government of Haryana. The qualification prescribed for appointment to the post of Transport Officer was Matric with certificate or diploma in Mechanical or Automobile Engineering with 5 years (3 years for diploma holders) technical and administrative experience in the State Transport or in Automobile Workshop with adequate knowledge of Hindi or Punjabi. On the basis of these qualifications, it has been asserted by the petitioner that he belongs to the category of Engineers. It has further been pleaded that the petitioner is entitled to the equation of the post of Transport Officer with that of Engineer as initially, when the petitioner was appointed, the pay scale of the post, which the petitioner was holding, was higher than that of the Engineers but subsequently with the revision of pay scale w.e.f. .04.1979, the pay scale of the post held by the petitioner has been kept lower than those of the degree holder Engineers. From 01.01.1986, the petitioner was granted the pay scale of Rs. 2000-3500 whereas the Engineers also were granted the same scale but subsequently w.e.f. .05.1989, after a period of 5 years of regular service, the pay scale has been fixed at Rs. 3000-4500 and after 12 years, it would be Rs. 4100- . On the basis of these, the petitioner is claiming that he is entitled to the scale of Rs. 3000-4500 after 5 years of regular service and Rs. 4100- after 12 years of regular service. This claim of the petitioner is primarily based on the analogy that he belongs to the category of Engineers and, therefore, would be entitled to the same benefit. On the other hand, the respondents have taken a specific stand that the post of Transport Officer was never equated with that of an Engineer. The petitioner is holding a diploma in Engineering whereas he is claiming the benefit of equation of pay with that of degree holder Engineers. The petitioner was placed in the pay scale of Rs. 2000-3500 w.e.f. 01.01.1986 but as a measure personal to him and taking a lenient view, the petitioner has been granted the scale of Rs. 2200-4000/- w.e.f. 01.10.1991. It has further been pleaded that the nature of duties, responsibilities, qualifications of the post of the petitioner and that of the Engineers, is totally different nor has there ever been an equation of these posts, thus, dis-entitling the petitioner to the claim, which has been made by him in the writ petition. It has further been stated that the pay scale of the petitioner became same as that of the Engineers because of the bunching of various pay scales when the revision of the pay scales took place. Counsel for the petitioner submits that as the petitioner holds the minimum qualification, which requires a diploma in Automobile Engineering, therefore, for all intents and purposes, he should be treated as an Engineer and thus, entitled to the pay scale, which has been granted to the Engineers vide notification dated 02.06.1989. On the other hand, counsel for the respondents submits that the notification dated 02.06.1989 (Annexure P-1), reliance whereof has been made by the petitioner, is specifically applicable only to the Doctors and Engineers. Merely because the petitioner holds the diploma in Automobile Engineering, does not entitle him the benefit of the post of an Engineer, especially when there is no equation of the said post and further that the qualifications, responsibilities and duties are different. He further contends that it is not a function of the Court to equate the post or grant equation of pay scales, which should be left to the Expert Bodies and the Executives. In support of this contention, he relies upon a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. vs. J.P.Chaurasia, (1) SCC 121. I have heard the counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. It is not in dispute that the qualifications, duties, responsibilities and the work performed by the petitioner and the Engineers is different. There has never been an equation of the two posts nor has the post of Transport Officer ever been declared as a post of an Engineer. That being so, the notification dated 02.06.1989 would not be applicable to the petitioner. Further, the pay scale and the post also can be equated by an Expert Body which the Court should refrain from performing the role unless there is overwhelming evidence on record in this regard. Generally, it should be left open to the Executives to perform the said responsibility. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. vs. J.P.Chaurasia (supra) has also held on similar lines. In view of the above, finding no merit in the present writ petition, the same stands dismissed. August 18, 2010\n\n(AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH ) pj\n\nJUDGE",

Bhandari, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. Satish Bhanot, Senior Deputy Advocate General, Punjab, for respondent No.1. None for respondents No.2 and 3. Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia, J. (Oral)\n\nThe present petitioner has raised two fold submissions in the present writ petition. It was stated by the petitioner that he joined as Secretary in the Municipal committee, Chheharta, District Amritsar in August 1957. The petitioner submitted that he has working in Class-I Municipalities. At the time when Punjab Municipal Service (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as the Rules ) were enforced, there were 12 posts of Executive Officers of Class-I. Later on 14 more posts were created. Thus, there were 26 posts of Executive Officers of Class-I. The petitioner has raised grievance against the advertisement dated 30.9.1987 issued by the State of Punjab for filling up nine posts of Executive Officers of Class-I for the State of Punjab through direct recruitment. Petitioner stated that since he acquired experience, the action of respondent-Punjab State is bad in issuing interview letters to the persons for appointment as Executive Officers in Municipal Committees Grade-I by way of direct recruitment.\n\nAn affidavit was submitted by the Under Secretary to the Government of Punjab in which it was stated that as per the 1975 Rules, nine posts of Executive Officers of Class-I in the State are to be filled up by way of direct recruitment in accordance with the Rules. It is stated that six persons were absorbed as Executive Officers in Class-I Municipal Committees in terms of Rule 5(1) of the above said Rules and as per Rules, 50% vacancies are to be filled up by way of direct recruitment and 50% vacancies are to be filled up by promotion on seniority-cum-merit basis. Mr. Bhanot has very categorically stated that the petitioner has retired. Second grievance made in the present writ petition is that petitioner had discharged his duties as Executive Officer of Class-I in Class-I Municipal Committees in his own pay scale, therefore, he is entitled to be paid salary as per the scale which were admissible to the Executive Officer Class-I. Petitioner has stated that since he had discharged his duties as Executive Officers Class-I the maxim of Equal Pay for Equal Work has to operate in his favour and State is bound to pay the salary to him as the Executive Officer Grade-I. In reply filed, it has been submitted that till the direct recruits were to be appointed on the administrative ground, petitioner as Executive Officers Class-II was asked to discharge duties as Executive Officer Grade-I. It has been stated that petitioner was neither appointed as Executive Officers Class-I by way of direct recruitment nor by way of promotion. If due to the exigencies of situation, an employee, till the new incumbent arrived, working in a lower grade is asked to discharge duties on a similar post having a higher grade as a stop gap arrangement, he cannot claim that he should be paid salary according to the higher grade. Mr. Bhanot states that later all the petitioner was promoted as Executive Officer Class-I. Learned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon Smt. P. Grover v. State of Haryana 1983(2) Services Law Reporter 734, in which it was held that where a person is promoted and is paid lower scale that cannot be sustained. This judgment is of no help to the petitioner to the present writ petition as in the present case there was no promotional order of the petitioner. He was to only discharge duties till the direct incumbents were appointed. Petitioner was Executive Officer of Municipal Committee Grade-II, simply because he was discharging the same duties in Municipal Committee Grade-I, it will not be held that he was discharging the duties of a post which carried some onerous responsibility. Similarly, the other two judgments rendered in Anand Parkash v. State of Punjab 2005(3) Recent Services Judgments 749 and judgment rendered by learned Single Bench of this Court in Satish Kumar and Others v. State of Haryana (Civil Writ Petition No. 8615 of 1991 decided on 20.10.1993) are of no help to the petitioner as in Satish Kumar's case (supra), petitioner was not considered for promotion. In the present case, post was meant for direct recruits. Since the petitioner was not discharging duties of higher responsibility, therefore, he is not entitled to the relief sought.\n\nMr. Bhanot states that at the relevant time, services rendered in Municipal Committee Grade-I was provincial service and the petitioner was to be selected to become member of Municipal Committee Grade-I. He cannot claim that he should be paid the salary which is due to the Executive Officer discharging the duties of Municipal Grade-I.\n\nIt has been consistently considered and held by this Court that only a regular selection by way of advertisement or from requisition made from the Employment Exchange shall vest right in the incumbent. A person like petitioner discharging duties will not be entitled to the benefit of scale prevailing for that post.\n\nHence, there is no merit in the present petition, same is dismissed.

To be referred to the Reporters or not ? Yes/No . Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? Yes/No -.- K. KANNAN J. . Both the cases are connected in the sense that they are between the same parties though the reliefs claimed were distinct but in relation to the affairs of Arya Samaj, Alipur. The plaintiffs have filed the suit for a declaration that the sale made by the defendants Nos.2 to in favour of the 1st defendant is void and for an injunction restraining -2- them from in any manner interfering with the possession of the property. At the time of institution of suit, there had been merely an agreement of sale but subsequently, the sale deed had been executed on 01.12.1978. The plaintiffs had, therefore, amended the plaint to bring the subsequent event and has sought for a declaration of sale as invalid and void. The trial Court held that the property belonging to Arya Samaj, Alipur but proceeded to dismissed the plaintiffs' suit, who were admittedly not owners. The court found that they had no locus standi to institute the suit in relation to the property belonged to the society. The Appellate Court affirmed the finding that the plaintiffs did not have locus standi but held that the sale had been properly executed on appropriate resolution of the Executive Committee of the Arya Samaj. The plaintiffs were contending that defendants No.2 to 5 have been acting office-bearers of Arya Samaj, Rishi Nagar, Sonepat when the property actually belonged to the Arya Samaj, Alipur. The Appellate Court found that Arya Samaj Alipur Punarsthapit, Sonepat was really the same as Arya Samaj, Alipur and the attempt of the plaintiffs in trying to show that there were two different entities was not justified. The Court also found that the sale had been properly made and there was no scope for interference. . On the basis of pleadings, following substantial questions of law have been framed for consideration in RSA No.831 of 1983:- (i) whether the sale by defendants No.2 to 5 was valid and binding on the Arya Samaj, Alipur on the ground that the defendants No.2 to 5 had the competency to represent the society and bind the society? -3- (ii) whether the plaintiffs, who claimed to be members of the society, the locus standi to impeach the sale by the persons claiming to be the authorized persons to sell the property of the society in favour of 1st defendant? . On the first issue of whether the plaintiff could maintain the action for declaration of injunction, the answer resides in the fact that the provisions of Section 5 and 6 of the Societies Registration Act itself detail as to who could be competent to represent a society and how a suit could be filed by or against a registered society. Admittedly, the suit is filed on the basis that the property belongs to a registered society of Arya Samaj, Alipur. The plaintiffs are two of the life members and the declaration in relation to the property of the society could be done only in the manner contemplated under the provisions of the said Act. It should be first determined as to how the title to the property belonging to a registered society itself could vest. Section 5 of the Societies Registration Act reads thus:- The property, movable and immovable, belonging to a society registered under this Act, if not vested in trustees, shall be deemed to be vested, for the time being, in the governing body of such society, and in all proceedings, civil and criminal, may be described as the property of the governing body of such society by their proper title. . Unlike a company, a society is not a juristic person. In Tata Memorial Hospital Workers Union Vs. Tata Memorial Centre (2010) SCC 480, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the property belonging to a society does not give the society a corporate status in the matter of holding and acquiring property; it merely describes the the property which vests in the trustee or the governing body for the time being. -4- The manner of vesting has also been considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dharam Dutt Vs. Union of India (2004) 1 SCC 712. It must, therefore, be seen that the property that belongs to the society must be taken as vesting only on the executive members of the society. . The action of the society of whether the transaction of the sale could be valid nor not, could, therefore, be tested only in the light of what power a registered society has with reference to its properties and the manner of its dealing. If there is no express prohibition contained in the Memorandum of Association or the Bye-laws for dealing with the properties purchased in the name of the society, then it should only be seen that the property that vests in the managing committee could be dealt with by an appropriate resolution. In this case, admittedly there has been a resolution of the society for transfer of the property and it is claimed and not denied by the appllants that one of the plaintiffs himself has been a party to the resolution. It is contended by the plaintiff that a majority decision had been taken for sale of the property and it has been accordingly sold. The sale in favour of the 1st defendant cannot be impeached at the instance of the plaintiffs when the transaction of sale is admittedly supported by a majority resolution of the governing body of the society. The sale would, therefore, bind the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs cannot contest the same by means of a declaratory action. Both as regards the frame of suit as well as the validity of the sale, the lower Appellate Court has correctly considered the matter and I find no reason to interfere with the same. The second appeal filed in RSA No.831 of 1983 shall, therefore, stand dismissed. . The appeal in RSA No.2315 of 1989 is at the instance of the -5- society, which seeks for the relief of injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the plaintiff's power of management as a President of the Society. At the time of argument to a query whether the plaintiff continues to be a President, the counsel for the appellant states that he has no such instructions and in any event, the same person cannot be a President at this length of time. The relief sought for in the plaint has, by sheer passage of time, become stale and I do not propose to open the issue of the entitlement for the relief of injunction sought at the instance of a person claiming to be the President of the society. No relief is necessary and the appeal in RSA No.2315 of 1989 would require to be dismissed as infructuous and dismissed as such. (K. KANNAN) JUDGE November 04, 2011 Pankaj*",

This revision is directed against the judgment dated 8.7.1999 passed by the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge (I), Jind whereby he dismissed the appeal filed by Zile Singh accused against the judgment/order of sentence dated 11.12.1997 rendered by the court of Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Narwana, vide which he convicted and sentenced the aforesaid accused to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- under Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (for brevity the Act ) and in default of payment of the fine, to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of three months. The facts in brief of the prosecution are that Govt. Food Inspector Khushi Ram Gambhir accompanied by Dr. R.S.Khatri inspected the premises of accused Zile Singh near Laxmi Cinema Narwana on .2.1990 at 2.30 P.M. and he was found in possession of about 2 kgs. of paneer (Cheese) for public sale contained in an Aluminum tray. The aforesaid Inspector also joined PW Madan Lal as a witness. After giving a notice Ex.PA, the aforesaid Inspector demanded a sample of paneer. Thereafter, he purchased 750 grams paneer from the accused on payment of Rs.24/- vide receipt Ex.PB. The usual formalities were observed. The certificate Ex.PE was issued by Public Analyst Haryana Chandigarh, in which it was opined that the sample of paneer was found to be adulterated. Then the aforesaid Inspector lodged a complaint. After recording pre-charge evidence, the accused was charged under Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Act, to which he did not plead guilty and claimed trial. The learned trial Magistrate after recording the prosecution evidence and statement of the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. and after hearing the Government Food Inspector for the State, learned defence counsel and examining the evidence on record, convicted and sentenced the accused as noticed at the outset. Feeling aggrieved with his conviction/sentence, the petitioner preferred an appeal, which was also dismissed by the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Jind. Being undaunted and dissatisfied with the judgments rendered by both the courts below, he has preferred this revision. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties, besides perusing the record with due care and circumspection. Realising that he would not be able to persuade this court to take a view contrary to the findings returned by both the courts below, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that he does not wish to assail the conviction. On analysing and scrutinizing the evidence on record, it is found that the judgments recorded by both the courts below cannot be faulted with in any manner. Sequelly, conviction is maintained. At this juncture, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner has been facing the agony of trial since 1990 and that being so, his sentence may be reduced to the already undergone. I have given a deep and thoughtful consideration to this submission. Needless to say, this incident is more than 19 years old. As per the custody certificate, taken on record, the petitioner has undergone 2 months and 10 days of the actual sentence. In re:Sadhu Singh versus State of Punjab, 2004(1) Recent Criminal Reports (Criminal) 108, the accused was convicted under Section 326 of IPC. The occurrence being 18 years old, the sentence was reduced to the already undergone (one month). An identical view has also been taken in re: Nirmal Singh Versus State of Punjab 2005(1) Recent Criminal Reports (Crl.) 477. The petitioner has been facing the agony of trial since 1990. He has suffered both financial and mental agony on account of protracted trial. In my view, the ends of justice would be sufficiently met, if while maintaining the conviction, the sentence imposed upon the petitioner is reduced to the already undergone (2 months and 10 days). Accordingly, it is reduced to the already undergone (2 months and 10 days).\n\nth August, 2009 (Harbans Lal) gsv Judge\n\nWhether to be referred to the Reporter ? Yes/No.",

The Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Bhatinda and another .....Respondents CORAM:- HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE HARBANS LAL Present:- Mr. Varinder Pal Singh, Advocate for the petitioner. **** HARBANS LAL, J. This petition has been moved by the Pepsu Road Transport Corporation, Patiala under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India for quashing the order dated 24.3.1988 Annexure P.1. The brief facts giving rise to this petition are that Bagga Singh- respondent was placed under suspension on 11.5.1981 for committing misconduct. He was charge-sheeted and a departmental inquiry was held. Finally vide order dated 1.7.1985, he was awarded the punishment of stoppage of increment with cumulative effect with a further rider that he will not be paid anything over and above the subsistence allowance already drawn by him and the period of his suspension shall not be treated as period on duty. He filed an application under Section 33-C(2) of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (for short, `the Act') claiming the arrears of salary for the suspension period as well as arrears of increment from 7.6.1981 to .6.1987 which was opposed. Vide impugned order dated 24.3.1988 Annexure P.1, the same was allowed by the Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Bhatinda. -2- None has come forward to argue on behalf of the respondent- Bagga Singh. I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, besides perusing the findings returned by the learned Presiding Officer, Labour Court with due care and circumspection. Mr. Varinder Pal Singh, Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner argued that the workman's right to the relief claimed could not be determined by the Labour Court under Section 33-C(2) of the Act. He further puts that the right of Bagga Singh- respondent to receive the arrears of salary and treating his suspension period as on duty with effect from .11.1981 was neither existing nor settled and that being so, the jurisdiction of the Labour Court was barred to hear the application. I have well considered these submissions. Of course, as ruled in re: M.D., Oswal Hosiery (Regd.) v. D.D. Gupta, 1994 LLR 487 (Del.), once there is an admission of the existing right of the workman by the employer in regard to the benefit which the former is entitled to and receive from the later, section 33-C(2) of the Act would come into play. Here in this case, it is to be determined as to whether there was any such admission on the part of the Corporation. The learned Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Bhatinda has observed in the impugned award as under:- ii) The workman was placed under suspension on .5.1981. His suspension till 10-11-1981 is lawful according to Regulation No.24 ibid w.e.f. 11.11.1981, the workman was entitled to full wages because he could not be kept under suspension beyond a period of six months. He is thus entitled to wages over and above the -3- subsistence allowance from 11.1.1981 to 4.3.1985. Such arrears of wages have been claimed at the rate of Rs.135/- P.M. The management has not challenged the rate at which the workman has claimed the arrears. The amount of arrears under this head from 11.11.1981 to .3.1985 work out to Rs.6570/-. iii) Under Regulation No.13(5) of the Regulations, the period of suspension is not to count towards increments. The increment of Rs.15/- which had otherwise fallen due on 7.6.1981 thus was deferred by a period of six months i.e., the period of legal suspension. The increment thus fell due on 7.12.1981. Arrears of incremental arrears from 7.12.81 to 5.6.1982 @ Rs.15/- P.M. work out to Rs.90/-. (iv) The next annual increments of Rs.20/- P.M. each fell due respectively on 7.6.1982, 7.6.1983, 7.6.1984 and 7.6.85 and 7.6.86 and the workman was entitled to receive from the employer arrears @ Rs.35/- (15+20) i.e., Rs.420/- till .6.83 @ Rs.55/- (35+20) i.e. 660/- till 6.6.84, Rs.75/- (55+20) i.e., Rs.900/- till 6.6.85, Rs.95/- (Rs.75+20) i.e., /- till 6.6.1986 and @ Rs.115/- (95+20) i.e., Rs.1380 till 6.6.87, in all Rs.4300/-. I thus hold that a total sum of Rs.10,960/- is due by the Respondent to the workman. It is quite plain and patent from the above observations that the management has not challenged the rate at which the workman has claimed -4- the arrears. So, ostensibly, it tantamounts to admission of the existing right of the workman respondent. Sequelly, I do not consider it proper to interfere with the impugned award in the exercise of writ jurisdiction under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India. Hence, this petition is dismissed.

It is quite plain and patent from the above observations that the management has not challenged the rate at which the workman has claimed -4- the arrears."

ORDER Surya Kant, J. - (Oral): The petitioner seeks a mandamus for finalization of the disciplinary proceedings pending against him and thereafter to grant him promotion, arrears of salary and other service benefits. While working as Senior Branch Officer with Markfed at Sangrur, the petitioner was served with a charge-sheet dated 24.4.1984 (Annexure P-1). Before that, the petitioner was placed under suspension on .9.1983 which was revoked vide order dated 28.1.1987. The petitioner submitted his reply to the charge-sheet. It further appears that besides the CWP No.2188 of 1991 -: 2 :- petitioner, some more employees were also charge-sheeted by the Markfed. An Inquiry Officer was appointed on 7.9.1984 to conduct a joint inquiry against all of them. It further appears that while the inquiry proceedings were near completion, one of the charge-sheeted employee (Harpal Singh) filed CWP No.114 of 1987 challenging the disciplinary proceedings initiated against him. No stay was, however, granted by this Court against the inquiry proceedings but passing of the final order was stayed. Meanwhile, the inquiry officer had submitted the report but no further action on that basis was taken against the petitioner or those employees in whose favour there was no interim order passed by this Court. In sum and substance, the petitioner wanted that the disciplinary proceedings should be finalized as he was expecting his exoneration, which would have made him entitled to claim the arrears of salary during the period he remained under suspension, as also consideration for further promotion. This writ petition was filed in the year 1992. More than 16 years have passed thereafter. There is every possibility that by now, the disciplinary proceedings have come to an end and whatever consequential benefits might have been found due, have also been released in favour of the petitioner.

Mr. Sanjay Kaushal, Senior Standing Counsel, for the Chandigarh Administration. None for respondents 5, 6 and 8. Mr.Manohal Lall, Additional Advocate General, Punjab, for respondent No.7. ----- - 2 - . Whether reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment? . To be referred to the reporters or not? . Whether the judgment should be reported in the digest? ----- K.Kannan, J (Oral) . The petitioners are owners of the property in SCO Nos.70 to in Sector 17-D, Chandigarh. The final order of resumption in challenge is the one passed by the Advisor to the Administrator recording the fact that the violations which had been pointed out, had not been removed and, therefore, the property was liable for resumption. . The contention of the petitioners was that some of the violations which had been pointed out, could not be removed in view of the properties being in the possession of the tenants, who had taken independent pleas complaining that the land owners were colluding with the administration to oust them from possession by deliberately suffering an order of eviction. All the tenants in possession have been cited as respondents 6 to 8. The petitioners and the tenants have a common ground to canvass at the time when the writ petition is finally taken up to urge that the deviations which had been pointed out and which were taken as a basis for actions for resumption have since ceased or become compoundable. At the time when the order of resumption had been passed, the following violations had been pointed out:- 1. Direct entry to basement from public verandah has been provided which is not as per sanctioned plan. . Additional partitions is also done there. . Big show windows in right side verandah have been divided into small show windows. . Stair position from right side verandah is shifted at the back verandah against the plans and instead of round square pills are constructed. - 3 - Of the above 5 items of deviations, item No.2 refers to a conversion and division of a kitchen into a toilet and a small shop with entry from public verandah. The 2nd respondent has given an affidavit stating that the second violation had been removed and he had given an undertaking that he will pay the necessary compounding fee for violations 1, 3, 4 and 5 referred to above. Having regard to the subsequent event and the change of regulations relating to some of the deviations as compoundable, the order of resumption is set aside and the administration shall be at liberty to make an inspection of the property and ensure that deviation No.2 complained of has since been removed as affirmed in the affidavit. The administration shall be at liberty to assess the compounding fee as permissible under rules and make a demand specifying the amounts and the petitioners shall be bound to make the payment. Any default on their part will result in the consequences which the regulations provide for. The writ petition is allowed on the above terms. The affidavit given by Shri Mohan Singh, is taken on record and shall form part of the record. Civil Writ Petition Nos.16737 and 17084 of 1989 . In these two writ petitions, the petitiones are the tenants of the very same premises i.e. SCO Nos.70 to 72 in Sector 17-D, Chandigarh and the benefit of cancellation of the resumption order would avail to the benefit of the petitioners also. The writ petitions filed by them are also allowed on the above terms. ` (K.KANNAN) JUDGE .04.2010 sanjeev",

    "summary": "The final order of resumption in challenge is the one passed by the Advisor to the Administrator recording the fact that the violations which had been pointed out, had not been removed and, therefore, the property was liable for resumption. The contention of the petitioners was that some of the violations which had been pointed out, could not be removed in view of the properties being in the possession of the tenants, who had taken independent pleas complaining that the land owners were colluding with the administration to oust them from possession by deliberately suffering an order of eviction. The petitioners and the tenants have a common ground to canvass at the time when the writ petition is finally taken up to urge that the deviations which had been pointed out and which were taken as a basis for actions for resumption have since ceased or become compoundable. Having regard to the subsequent event and the change of regulations relating to some of the deviations as compoundable, the order of resumption is set aside and the administration shall be at liberty to make an inspection of the property and ensure that deviation No.2 complained of has since been removed as affirmed in the affidavit."

    "court": "-1- IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH Date of Decision:- 11.02.2009 Ashok Kumar and others ....Petitioner(s) vs. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Jalandhar and another ....Respondent(s) *** CORAM:- HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH *** Present:- Mr.Surinder Sharma, Advocate for the petitioners. Mr.P.K.Mutneja, Advocate for respondent No.2. *** AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. (Oral) In the present writ petition, challenge is to the award dated .3.1992 (Annexure P-9) vide which the Labour Court has come to the conclusion that the services of the workmen have not been terminated and they were very much the employees of the respondent-Management and, thus, the dispute as sought to be raised by the workmen did not exist as the enquiry proceedings were going on against them. Thus, the reference being pre-mature, it was answered against the workmen and in favour of the Management. Counsel for the petitioners contends that the Labour Court has gone beyond the reference. He contends that the reference was whether termination of services of the 23 workmen who had preferred a demand notice on which references were sent for adjudication to the Labour Court, -2- was justified and in order and if not, to what relief/exact amount of compensation each of them is entitled to. He contends that the Labour Court instead of adjudicating upon the reference made to it has proceeded to hold that there was no termination of the workmen and in view of this, the reference was pre-mature. He submits that the workmen had not been allowed to work in the factory and they were not allowed to enter the premises due to which they could not perform their duties. This would lead to only one conclusion that their services had been terminated by the Management. He submits that this termination was abrupt without holding any proper enquiry as neither any notice was given nor any charge-sheet was issued nor any retrenchment compensation paid to them. Therefore, he contends that the termination is not in accordance with law and the provisions governing the services of the workmen i.e. the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 have been violated with impunity. He relies upon the statements of the workmen to contend that they have categorically stated before the Labour Court that they have not been allowed to continue in service as they were not allowed to perform their duties. In this view of the matter, he submits that the award passed by the Labour Court cannot be sustained as the requirement of the reference was to adjudicate upon the issues as to whether the termination of the services of the workmen was in order and to what relief and amount of compensation they were entitled to. That having not been done, the present writ petition deserves to be allowed. He further relies upon an award dated 21.12.1992 (Annexure P-10) passed by the Labour Court, Jalandhar, of a co-worker wherein a reference preferred by a similarly situated employee had been answered in favour of the workmen although the same grounds which have been taken by the -3- employer as in the case of the petitioners were rejected by the Labour Court. He further contends that a writ petition preferred by the respondent- Management against this award i.e. C.W.P.No.7289 of 1993 was dismissed by a Division Bench of this Court on 12.1.1994. However, liberty was granted to the Management to proceed with the enquiry referred to in the award and to pass such order as it deemed appropriate in accordance with law. He, on this basis, presses that similar relief be granted to the petitioners. Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, contends that the present writ petition with regard to petitioners No.21 and 22 is not maintainable as both these workmen had not appeared before the Labour Court to support their assertions made in their demand notice. This factual position having not been disputed by the counsel for the petitioner, writ petition on behalf of petitioners No.21 and 22 Vas Dev, Typist Yashpal Singh, Turner respectively, is held to be not maintainable and dismissed as such on the ground that the Labour Court in its award itself has on this very ground answered the reference against these petitioners. Counsel for the respondent has further submitted that the award passed by the Labour Court is in accordance with law. He submits that before the Conciliation Officer the stand of the Management was that the workmen have been charge-sheeted and enquiry proceedings were pending against them and the record in that regard was also produced before the Conciliation Officer. He contends that the stand of the Management from the very inception was that the services of the workmen have not been terminated and since the workmen were still in service when the reference was made, there could have been no dispute under Section 10 of the Act. -4- After the said reference had been made by the Appropriate Government, the Labour Court on going through the records and the evidence led before it, has come to a conclusion that the reference was pre-mature on the ground that the termination of the workmen was not there. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and with their able assistance have gone through the records of the case as well as the impugned award. A perusal of the same would clearly show that MW-1 Shri Ranjit Singh, a Clerk of the local Labour Office, had appeared before the Labour Court and produced the records of the conciliation proceedings in the form of Exhibit M-1. Shri J.K.Sehgal, MW-2 had appeared before the Labour Court and produced various documents showing the charge-sheets and the notices issued to different workmen in relation to initiation of domestic enquiries against them. Even during the pendency of the proceedings before the Labour Court, it is apparent that the enquiries were pending before the workmen. The workmen in their cross-examination have admitted that show cause notices and charge-sheets regarding initiation of enquiries against them were either received by them or the said charge- sheets were dispatched on their correct addresses. However, this does indicate that the workmen were aware of the domestic enquiries being initiated and continuation thereof against them. Despite this knowledge, the workmen had proceeded to raise an industrial dispute claiming therein that their services have been terminated. The finding as recorded by the Labour Court, therefore, cannot be faulted with that the reference was pre-mature as the services of the workmen were not terminated on the date(s) alleged by them or on the date(s) when the reference was made. That being so, the only conclusion which can be arrived at and has rightly been reached by the -5- Labour Court is that the reference was pre-mature. That being the position, no illegality can be said to have been committed by the Labour Court in passing Award dated 21.12.1992 (Annexure P-9). The contention of the counsel for the petitioners that in the case of similarly placed employees, the reference has been answered in favour of the workmen and against the Management although the grounds taken therein were on the same lines as in the present proceedings. A perusal of the said award ( Annexure P-10) would show that the Court has proceeded to decide the case as per the pleadings before the said Court. This order, when challenged before this Court in C.W.P.No.7289 of 1993 which came to be decided on 12.1.1994, this order also says that the enquiries which has been referred to in the award were still continuing against the workmen and the Court has also given liberty to the Management to proceed with the enquiries and to pass such orders as it deems appropriate in accordance with law. This further shows that as a matter of fact, there was no termination in that case as well. However, this Court in exercise of its discretionary powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India refrained itself from exercising its writ jurisdiction. In view of the above, the present writ petition is without any merit and is hereby dismissed. However, a liberty is given to the Management to proceed in accordance with the findings, if any, against the workmen. February 11, 2009",

A.G., Haryana, Jasbir Singh, J. (oral) JUDGMENT This writ petition has been filed with a prayer to quash notification dated January 30, 1989, issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (in short the Act) to acquire a vast track of land including land owned by the petitioner falling in Khasras No. 5/23 and 14/3. Further challenge has been laid to a notification issued on January 25, 1990, under Section 6 of the Act. As per facts on record, land was acquired for a public purpose, namely, for the development and utilisation of land as residential and commercial area for Sector 30 at Gurgaon. -2- Heard counsel for the parties. In this writ petition, it is specific case of the petitioners that in the land under their ownership, they have constructed the residential houses. It is contended by counsel for the petitioner that discrimination has been done to the petitioner by not releasing their land, whereas a vast track of land was released in favour of a Company known as M/S Unitech Ltd. To show that the construction was in existence, when notification under Section 4 of the Act was issued, reference was made to an averment made in para No. 4 of the writ petition, wherein it is only stated that the petitioner's residential house is in existence in the land in dispute. To the contrary, in paragraph No. 2 of the writ petition, it is stated that the nature of the land owned by the petitioner was agricultural. Detail of the construction is not given. It has also come on record that when opportunity given, petitioner failed to file any objection under Section 5-A of the Act. In the reply filed, it has been stated as under: 1. That the petitioner has not come to the court with clean hands at all. The petitioner had alleged in para No. 4 of the Civil Writ Petition that he has constructed a house on the land in dispute. In fact, the land in dispute was completely vacant at the time of the issuance of the3 notification u/s 4 of the Land Acquisition Act. A survey was conducted fully in accordance with law and the land in dispute was completely vacant at the relevant time. Thus, the allegations regarding construction are totally false and concocted. The petitioner has made false -3- allegations with malafide intentions. The Civil Writ Petition merits dismissal on this ground alone. . That the petitioner has not filed any objections u/s 5-A of the Land Acquisition Act at all. The petitioner has got no right to challenge the acquisition proceedings at this stage. The Civil Writ Petition filed by the petitioner merits dismissal on this sole ground The respondents have taken a specific stand in the reply that when land was ordered to be acquired, it was lying vacant and further that petitioner has not raised any objection to the proposed acquisition. To the written-statement, replication was not filed to show that the construction was in existence. Even photographs of the alleged construction were not put on record. So far as ground of discrimination is concerned, the same is also not available to the petitioner. In the reply filed, it is stated that the land was released in favour of M/S Unitech Pvt. Ltd. Because a licence to develop that land, as a colony, has already been sanctioned in favour of the said company. As the petitioners have failed to file objections under Section -A of the Act, in view of ratio of judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Delhi Administration v. Gurdip Singh Uban and others , AIR 1999 Supreme Court 3822, this writ petition is not maintainable. In view of facts, mentioned above, no case is made out for interference.

PERMOD KOHLI, J.(Oral) This revision petition is directed against the order dated .08.1991 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Chandigarh, whereby the appeal preferred by the petitioner against the judgment dated 26.10.1987 passed by the learned Sub Judge Ist Class, Chandigarh, refusing to make the award rule of the Court, has been dismissed. Briefly stated that the facts of the case are that on the basis of an arbitration agreement between the parties, the matter was referred to one Ajit M. Saran, Arbitrator. The Arbitrator made and published his award on 11.10.1985. The petitioner filed an application under Section 14 and 17 of the Arbitration Act for making the award\n\n: 2 : rule of the Court whereas the respondent filed objections under Section of the Act seeking setting aside the award. It appears that both these applications were taken up together by the learned Sub Judge Ist Class, Chandigarh, for consideration. The trial Court framed the following issues:- . Whether the award dated 11.10.1985 is liable to be set aside? OPA . Relief. While considering issue No.1, it has been held that the objections are not sustainable. The challenge to the ward was made on two counts: (i) that the Arbitrator was appointed by designation and he has passed the award even after his transfer from the post of Additional Director, Industries, Haryana, (ii) that the Arbitrator has made the award beyond the period of four months. Both these objections have been rejected. It was found that the Arbitrator was by name and he was competent to proceed with the matter even after his transfer. As regards the question of limitation is concerned, it has been specifically held that the Arbitrator entered on the reference on .06.1985 and award was made on 11.10.1985, within the statutory period of four months. The objections were, thus, rightly rejected. As per the application filed by the petitioner for making the award the rule of the Court is concerned, the same has been dismissed having been filed beyond the period of 30 days. It has come on record that the State made an application on .12.1985 to the Arbitrator for copy of the award. The copy of the\n\n: 3 : award was made available to the petitioner on 23.1.1986, whereas the present application under Sections 14 and 17 of the Arbitration Act came to be filed on 21.2.1986. The learned Sub Judge Ist Class, Chandigarh, has rejected the application being barred by limitation on the ground that the limitation commenced from the date of the making of the award. Article 119 of the Limitation Act (Part-I: Applications in specified cases) governed the period of limitation and reads as under:- (a) for the filing in Court of an award (b) for setting aside an award or getting an award remitted for reconsideration. Thirty days Thirty days The date of service of the notice of the making of the award. The date of service of the notice of the filing of the award. From the above Article, it is apparent that the limitation commenced from the date of notice of the making of the award. In the present case, there is no material on record to indicate that the petitioner had the notice of the award. The learned Trial Court has simply drawn an inference without there being any material on record. The clear averment made in the petition that copy of the award was received on 23.1.1986 and the petitioner had filed the application only on 21.02.1986 within limitation. Apart from the above, the petitioner had only asked for the making of the award rule of the Court and there was no prayer to the Court for filing of the award. The order passed by the learned Sub Judge Ist Class, Chandigarh, was assailed by the petitioner before the learned Additional District Judge,Chandigarh,\n\n: 4 : who has also dismissed the appeal affirming the judgment of the learned trial Court. In view of the above, this petition is allowed. The impugned orders are set aside. The matter is remitted back to the learned trial Court for taking a fresh decision on merits. The parties through their counsel are directed to appear before the learned trial Court on 25.05.2010 for further proceedings. .02.2010 (PERMOD KOHLI) BLS JUDGE",

In opposition to the writ petitions, the State Government contended that the letter did not contemplate the grant of the grade to all teachers but only to teachers appointed as Masters. The High Court held the teachers entitled to the benefit of the revised grade, whether or not they had been appointed as Masters, because, in the opinion of the High Court, the qualifying criterion was the possession of a graduate degree. The judgment of the High Court was affirmed by this Court in Kirpal Singh Bhatia (AIR 1976 SC 2459) (supra). The State Government found it difficult, having regard to the prevailing burden on its financial resources, to extend the benefit of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 to the much wider section of teachers covered in consequence of the Court's judgment. Accordingly, the State Government issued Circular letter No.9/9/79",

Mrs. Sudeepti Sharma, Deputy Advocate General, Punjab. **** . Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment? . To be referred to the Reporter or not? .

No.1590 of 1991 as the common question of law and fact have been raised. The petitioners have claimed higher pay/ higher pay scale in lieu of acquisition of higher qualification. Their claim is founded on instructions dated 23.7.1957. Those instructions had granted benefit of higher basic or increments as and when teacher/ masters have acquired higher educational qualifications. Those instructions were withdrawn on 19.2.1979 and the pay-scale were de- linked from the higher qualification. According to the instructions dated .2.1979, the pay-scale of teacher/ masters were required to be fixed -2- according to the post held by them. The litigation between the teachers/ master travelled to Hon'ble the Supreme Court and in the case of Gurpal Tuli and others v. State of Punjab and others, AIR 1984 Supreme Court , the action of withdrawing instructions dated 23.7.1957 was upheld and in para 9 and 10, their lordships made following observations:- 9. It appears that several teachers filed writ petitions in the High Court claiming revised scales of pay on the ground that they had taken graduate degrees and, therefore, were entitled to the benefit of the grade mentioned against Category `A' in the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957. In opposition to the writ petitions, the State Government contended that the letter did not contemplate the grant of the grade to all teachers but only to teachers appointed as Masters. The High Court held the teachers entitled to the benefit of the revised grade, whether or not they had been appointed as Masters, because, in the opinion of the High Court, the qualifying criterion was the possession of a graduate degree. The judgment of the High Court was affirmed by this Court in Kirpal Singh Bhatia (AIR 1976 SC 2459) (supra). The State Government found it difficult, having regard to the prevailing burden on its financial resources, to extend the benefit of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 to the much wider section of teachers covered in consequence of the Court's judgment. Accordingly, the State Government issued Circular letter No.9/9/79-FR(2)/143 dated February 19, 1979, paragraph -3- of which stated that in order to ensure that these unintended and large financial implications do not continue arising in future the whole matter had been reconsidered by the State Government and as a result the Government ordered that henceforth the teachers of the Education Department would not automatically be entitled to placement in the higher scales of pay in terms of paragraph 3 of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 by the mere circumstance of their improving or acquiring higher qualifications in the course of their service. The rigour of the restriction was relaxed in some measure. Paragraph 3 said further:- However, in order to avoid discrimination between teachers who have already been allowed higher scales of pay on account of having improved their qualifications and those who have not yet been allowed this benefit even though they also possess higher qualifications it is decided that all teachers in the Education Department who have improved their qualifications before the issue of this letter may be allowed the benefit of higher scale of pay on the basis of their qualifications. The benefit was not extended to those who were appointed or who had improved their qualifications after the issue of that Circular letter. The teachers continued to agitate for a more generous dispensation. The State -4- Government then issued Circular letter No.8937-5ED. /2659 dated September 20, 1979, which declared:- The implementation of the decision contained in Finance Department circular letter No.9/9/79 FR (2)/143 dated February 19, 1979 to grant higher pay scales to the teachers on the basis of higher qualifications was kept pending for want of clarification on certain points from the Finance Department which has now become available is reproduced below:- . The higher scale may be allowed from the date of passing the respective higher examination by the concerned teacher where this has already been done. However, actual payment at enhanced rates should commence from 12-2-79 and the payment of arrears accruing from the date of passing the examination till 13-2-1979 be restricted to the maximum for 38 months. . The benefit of the higher scale may be allowed from the date a particular teacher is appointed on regular basis or the date of passing the higher examination, whichever is later, but the payment of arrears as a result of grant of such benefit should be restricted to a period of 38 months only, as already -5- mentioned above. . The teachers placed in the higher scale can only be regularly adjusted when corresponding posts in the higher scale become available; in that case such teachers may continue to enjoy the higher scale as a personal measure till they are adjusted against regular posts as and when the same become available. . It was clarified that the contemplated benefit was confined to the categories of teachers mentioned in the Circular letter No.5058.FR-II-57/5600 dated July 23, . In all the writ petitions, the petitioners have acquired post graduate qualification after 19.2.1979. According to the instructions dated .2.1979, the teachers of the Education Department would not automatically be entitled to placement in the higher scale of pay in terms of para 3 of the circular letter dated 23.7.1957 by virtue of merely acquiring higher qualification in the course of their service. However, on 20.9.1979, a clarification was issued that those who had acquired the qualification before .2.1979 and were appointed would be entitled to the grant of benefits in terms of letter dated 23.7.1957 subject to further conditions. It is thus evident that the benefits in lieu of higher qualification acquired after .2.1979 would not be available to the petitioners who have admittedly acquired post graduate qualification much later. The writ petitions are wholly misconceived and are thus liable to be dismissed. -6- For the reasons afore-mentioned, these writ petitions fails and same are dismissed. April 29, 2009\n\n( M.M.

Haryana State and others. A perusal of the record of Civil Writ Petition No.942 of 1993 shows that order dated 24.9.1993 was set aside by the Hon'ble Apex Court and the case was remitted to this Court to reconsider the matter, which was pertaining to the grant of full pay scale of office -2- *** Superintendent to the petitioner on the basis of equal pay for equal work. In the present writ petition, no interim order was passed regarding the transfer of the petitioner and the said transfer was ordered on 16.5.1994 and about 19 years have passed since then. Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of as having been rendered infructuous."

Mr. Rajinder Goyal, Advocate, for respondent No. 2. JASBIR SINGH, J. (oral) JUDGMENT This writ petition has been filed with a prayer to modify award dated August 10, 1987, vide which compensation, for the acquired land, was granted to the petitioner at the rate of Rs. 8/- per square yard. Heard counsel for the parties. It is apparent from the record that about 19 Kanals of land of the petitioner was sought to be acquired by -2- issuing a Notification under Section 36 of the Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922 (in short 1922 Act) on September 16, 1969. Notification under Section 42 (2) of the 1922 Act was issued on March 7, 1972. The Land Acquisition Collector, Bhiwani, vide Award dated January 19, 1973, fixed market price of the land in question at Rs. 1.25 per square yard excluding compensation for the structures. The petitioner was not satisfied. He moved an application under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 for enhancement of compensation, which was allowed by the Tribunal constituted under the 1922 Act vide order dated August 10, 1987 and compensation amount was enhanced to Rs. 8/- per square yard. Even then the petitioner was not satisfied. He came to this Court by filing this writ petition. It is primary contention of counsel for the petitioner that the Tribunal has not taken note of the potential value of the land under acquisition for its development towards commercial and residential use and further that the evidence produced was not appreciated properly especially judgment passed by this Court ( Ex.P-21) on November 25, 1981, awarding compensation for the adjoining land at the rate of Rs. 14/- per square yard. Madan Singh, Clerk, Improvement Trust (PW2) deposed that land is situated on Bhiwani Circular Road, next to the Adarsh College and opposite to the Bus Stand. It was also so reiterated by Ghansham Dass (PW3) who had been working in the Municipal Committee, Bhiwani. He has specifically stated that the land falls within the Municipal limits and is situated next to the General Bus Stand. To know the situation of land, which was subject matter of judgment dated November 25, 1989 (Ex. P-21), -3- we passed the following order on August 31, 2010: At the time of arguments, to enhance compensation, reliance has been placed upon a judgment of this Court, copy of which is Ex. P-21. It is contention of the counsel for the petitioner that the land, which was subject matter of judgment Ex. P-21, is situated in the near vicinity of the land, which was subject matter of acquisition in this writ petition. To settle the equities, we deem it proper to direct the Improvement Trust to put on record site plan showing the situation at the spot of the land, which is subject matter of this acquisition and also situation of the land, which was subject matter of acquisition in judgments Ex. P-21 and Ex. P-7, which are found mentioned in paragraph No. 25 of the impugned Award. Site plan has been produced in Court today, which clearly indicates that the land in dispute, in this case, is situated on the main road and adjoins the land which was subject matter of judgment Ex. P-21 , which is situated at its back side. The potential of the land in dispute, as per situation at the spot, is much more as compared to the land, which was acquired by issuing a notification under Section 36 of the 1922 Act on March 12, 1973. It appears that the Tribunal has not relied upon that instance, to grant compensation because the land was acquired after about 3 years from the date when land in dispute was acquired. Vide the -4- judgment, mentioned above, the compensation of that land was enhanced to Rs. 14/- per square yard. Taking note of the situation of the land in this case and its proximity to the Bus Stand, and a College and also a fact that it is situated within the Municipal limits, we are of the view that the compensation awarded is on the lower side. We propose to take note of the compensation awarded vide judgment (Ex. P-21) dated November\n\n, . In the said case, land was acquired 3 years after the land in dispute was acquired. In view of that, we decide to deduct Rs. 4/- towards escalation in prices in the meantime and grant Rs. 10/- per square yard towards compensation in this case. The amount granted towards other statutory benefits by the Tribunal is maintained. With above said modification, this writ petition stands disposed of. Respondent- Improvement Trust is directed to make payment of the compensation amount within a period of two months.\n\n( JASBIR SINGH ) JUDGE (AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH) JUDGE December 16 , 2010. DKC",

In the light of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chinnama George and others Versus N.K.Raju and another-(2000) 4 SCC 130, the Insurance Company is transposed as respondent and the Registry shall carry out the transposition and array the Insurance Company as 4th respondent. - 2 - . If the case must be treated as an appeal by the insured only, the issue has to be considered with reference to the evidence available as regards the salary of the deceased. The deceased was a Veterinary Surgeon at Government Piggery Farm, Ambala and the salary certificate has been filed showing that he was drawing Rs.3,895/-. It was elicited in evidence that he had put in 7 years of service and the Tribunal had taken the monthly contribution to be Rs.2,600/-. The Court had applied a multiplier of 20 following the judgment of this Court in Joginder Kaur Versus State of Haryana through Secretary Transport-1991 ACJ 374. The application of the multiplier in the light of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma and others Versus Delhi Transport Corporation and another-2009 ACJ 1298, would have been to provide for a multiplier of 17. In this case, it is seen that the deceased was a government servant and the Tribunal has not taken note of the future prospects of increase in salary. The Court is empowered to take judicial notice of the fact that in government service there are periodical increments through Pay Commission recommendations and the failure of the Tribunal to provide for future increments in salary with promotional prospects would, therefore, require to be remedied by taking the future increases at 150% of the salary that he was drawing and if average were to be taken after making provision for such an increase, the monthly income should be taken as Rs.6,000/-. If even 17 multiplier were to be applied to the amount and provide for all other statutory allowances, the amount that would require to be paid would not fall short of Rs.6,30,000/-, which was the amount awarded by the Tribunal and, under - 3 - the circumstances, I do not find that there is no scope for modification of the award. If, at all there, is only a scope for an increase. However, there is no representation on behalf of the respondents, I do not propose to undertake such an exercise. The award of the Tribunal is confirmed in all respects and the appeal is dismissed. (K.KANNAN) JUDGE .06.2010 sanjeev",

Shri Rajiv Kwatra, Senior D.A.G. Haryana. MAHESH GROVER, J. The petitioner in this petition prays that the service rendered by him on work charge basis followed by regularization be considered for grant of pensionary benefits. The petitioner joined the services of the State of Punjab, P.W.D. B&R Branch on 15.1.1947 as Lower Divisional Clerk and was subsequently promoted as Senior Clerk and Accounts Clerk. He continued to serve in the State of Punjab prior to its re-organization and subsequently worked with the State of Himachal Pradesh with effect from 1.11.1966 till 14.8.1967 when he resigned from there. He then joined services of the State of Haryana on 4.2.1971 as C.W.P. No.8674 of 1994 -2- Accounts Clerk-cum-Store Munshi as a work charged employee. On 2.6.1983 the petitioner retired on attaining the age of superannuation. In the backdrop of the aforesaid facts, the petitioner has prayed for grant of pensionary benefits which have been declined to him, and as a justification thereof, the respondents have stated in their reply that the petitioner was brought on the regular rolls of the Department of P.W.D.(B&R), but the order of regularization could not be implemented because the petitioner failed to submit himself for the medical examination which was the requirement. The date of regularization attributed to the petitioner is 28.8.1980 which is also evident from Annexure R-1. The solitary ground on which the prayer of the petitioner has been declined, has been noticed above i.e. the order of regularization not being implemented on account of non-cooperation of the petitioner who failed to submit himself for medical examination. I have considered the matter and am of the opinion that the petition deserves to be accepted. The petitioner has concededly worked as a work charge employee with the respondents. His services were regularized on 28.8.1980 and he retired from the Department in 1983 on attaining the age of superannuation. Merely because he did not get himself medically examined, would not rob him of the benefit of regularization more particularly so, when he continued to serve the respondents in the year 1983 i.e. 3 years after the date of regularization. The periods rendered by him as work charge employee prior to regularization would therefore, need to be counted for the purposes of pension keeping in view the observations of a Full Bench of this Court in Kesar Chand v. State of Punjab Through the Secretary, P.W.D. B&R, Chandigarh and others 1988(5) S.L.R. 27.

That in the written statement, it has been pleaded that the petitioner had been given full opportunity to give his view point. The enquiry was with jurisdiction as it pertained to indulgence in corruption by the petitioner by acquiring disproportionate assets to his known sources of income and, therefore, issuance of show cause notice dated 30.1.1990 was within the jurisdiction of respondent no.1. The enquiry was started against the petitioner on the basis of a complaint and a check period was fixed from 1.1.1981 to 31.3.1983 to calculate the income and expenditure and it took long time in the collection of documents from various quarters. The enquiry was completed in the year 1987 and it was established that the petitioner was guilty of acquiring disproportionate assets beyond his known source of income. Thus, there was no delay in initiating action against the petitioner. . The writ petition was admitted on 12.3.1990 and ordered to be heard along with Civil Writ Petition No.9432 of 1989 and directed that the stay would be in the same terms as in the aforesaid writ petition. The office has put up the file of Civil Writ petition No.9432 of 1989 and from perusal of the same, it goes on to show that further proceedings before the Inquiry Officer were stayed in that case and subsequently passing of final order was stayed. The said writ petition was allowed vide order dated .5.2009 and the following observations have been made:- It is almost 20 years that the disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner have been stayed. The petitioner must have retired from service. No useful purpose will be served to allow the disciplinary proceedings to be continued after lapse of -3- **** such a long period. Otherwise also from the admitted facts on record, it appears that the incident relates back to the year -82, whereas charge sheet was issued after a period of 3 years and even the enquiry was constituted against after a period of 3 years. There has been a serious lapse on the part of the respondents in promptly initiating disciplinary proceedings. It is not deemed appropriate to allow the disciplinary proceedings after the lapse of such a long period. This petition is accordingly allowed, charge sheet dated .5.1985 and enquiry proceedings against the petitioner are hereby quashed. . A perusal of the record shows that the petitioner was charge sheeted on 29.10.1987 on the ground that he had incurred excess expenditure of ` 90,967/- which was beyond his known sources of income and that he had not taken prior permission of the Government for construction of the house. Eventually, the charge was only established to the extent of spending of ` 13,378/- more than known sources of income in the years 1981 to 1983 and it was on the basis of the said report, the show cause notice was issued on 30.1.1990 proposing penalty of dismissal from service, which is now subject matter of the writ petition. The respondents in their reply also admitted that a complaint had been received and the enquiry had been started in April, 1983 against the petitioner but the charge sheet was only issued on 29.10.1987. As per the respondents, there was no delay in initiating action against the petitioner as it took a long time for collection of documents from various quarters. The Hon'ble Apex Court in State of M.P. Vs. Bani Singh and another 1990 (Sup) SCC 738 had held that if there is no satisfactory explanation for the inordinate delay -4- **** in issuing the charge sheet, it would be unfair for the department to proceed with the enquiry. The said view was followed in State of A.P. Vs. N. Radhakishan 1998 (4) SCC 154 and it was held as under:- It is not possible to lay down any pre-determined principles applicable to all cases and in all situations where there is delay in concluding the disciplinary proceedings. Whether on that ground the disciplinary proceedings are to be terminated each case has to be examined on the facts and circumstances in that case. the essence of the matter is that the court has to take into consideration all relevant factors and to balance and weigh them to determine if it is in the interest of clean and honest administration that the disciplinary proceedings should be allowed to terminate after delay particularly when delay is abnormal and there is no explanation for the delay. The delinquent employee has a right that disciplinary proceedings against him are concluded expeditiously and he is not made to undergo mental agony and also monetary loss when these are unnecessarily prolonged without any fault on his part in delaying the proceedings. In considering whether delay has vitiated the disciplinary proceedings the Court has to consider the nature of charge, its complexity and on what account the delay has occurred. if the delay is unexplained prejudice to the delinquent employee is writ large on the face of it. It could also be seen as to how much disciplinary authority is serious in pursuing the charges against its employee. It is the basic principle of administrative justice that an officer entrusted with a particular job has to perform his duties honestly, efficiently -5- **** and in accordance with the rules. If he deviates from this path he is to suffer a penalty prescribed. Normally, disciplinary proceedings should be allowed to take its course as per relevant rules but then delay defeats justice. Delay causes prejudice to the charged officer unless it can be shown that he is to blame or when there is proper explanation for the delay in conducting the disciplinary proceedings. Ultimately, the court is to balance these two diverse considerations. . Thereafter in P.V.Mahadevan Vs. M.D.Tamil Nadu Housing Board 2005(6) SCC 636, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed as under:- Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion that allowing the respondent to proceed further with the departmental proceedings at this distance of time will be very prejudicial to the appellant. Keeping a higher government official under charges of corruption and disputed integrity would cause unbearable mental agony and distress to the officer concerned. The protracted disciplinary enquiry against a government employee should, therefore, be avoided not only in the interests of the government employee but in public interest and also in the interests of inspiring confidence in the minds of the government employees. At this stage, it is necessary to draw the curtain and to put an end to the enquiry. The appellant had already suffered enough and more on account of the disciplinary proceedings. As a matter of fact, the mental agony and sufferings of the appellant due to the protracted disciplinary proceedings would be much more than the punishment. For the mistakes committed by the -6- **** department in the procedure for initiating the disciplinary proceedings, the appellant should not be made to suffer. We, therefore, have no hesitation to quash the charge memo issued against the appellant. The appeal is allowed. The appellant will be entitled to all the retiral benefits in accordance with law. The retiral benefit shall be disbursed within three months from this date. No costs. Appeal allowed . Keeping in view the above principles laid down and after balancing the facts in the present case and keeping in view the fact the respondents have been unable to explain satisfactorily the delay in charge sheeting the petitioner even through they had received a complaint in 1983 and the said delay would necessarily have prejudiced the case of the petitioner to give a satisfactory explanation. In spite of the delay in initiating the proceedings, it is apparent that the petitioner still successfully was able to establish that he had not incurred excess expenditure of ` ,967/- as alleged and the charge was only established to the extent of ` ,378/-. Had the proceedings been initiated expeditiously, the prejudice would have not been caused to the petitioner. . That the disciplinary proceedings were stayed by a Division Bench of this Court on 12.3.1990, which was 22 years ago and the said order has remained in force for the last two decades, this Court is thus of the opinion that it would be appropriate to draw a curtain on the controversy and put an end to agony of the petitioner, who was appointed in the year 1961 and by now he must have retired from service. Accordingly, the present writ petition is allowed. Charge sheet dated .10.1987(Annexure P-1) and show cause notice dated 30.1.1990 -7- **** (Annexure P-2) whereby penalty of dismissal from service was proposed to be imposed upon the petitioner are quashed.

VERSUS State of Punjab and others ...RESPONDENTS CORAM: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Jasbir Singh Hon'ble Mr. Justice Augustine George Masih PRESENT: Mr. Arun Jain, Sr. Adv., with Mr. Amit Jain, Advocate, for the petitioners. Mr. Manohar Lall, Addl. A.G., Punjab; JASBIR SINGH, J. (oral) JUDGMENT This judgment will dispose of three petitions , i.e., Civil Writ Petitions No. 12154 of 1991, 8898 of`1991 and 8811 of 1996. For facility of dictating judgment facts are being taken from CWP No. 12154 of 1991. In this writ petition, challenge has been laid to a notification issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, (in short the Act) on March 11, 1977 proposing to acquire 3 Acres, 1 Kanal and 14 Marlas of land, for a public purpose, namely, construction of New Mandi Township at Pathankot. Challenge has also been laid to a Notification issued under -2- Section 6 of the Act on March 14, 1977. It is necessary to mention here that while issuing above said notifications, provisions of Section 17 of the Act were also invoked. Challenge has also been laid to the Award passed on September 23, 1986. It is apparent from the records that the petitioners earlier also filed a Civil Writ Petition No. 5726 of 1982 with a prayer to quash the notifications issued under Sections 4 and 6. That writ petition was allowed in their favour vide order dated January 31, 1983 and the notifications in question were quashed. The respondent -State went to the Hon'ble Supreme Court and in Civil Appeal No. 2334 of 1986, vide order dated March 6, , judgment, passed by the High Court, was quashed and the acquisition was upheld. Concluding portion of the judgment, passed by the Supreme Court, reads thus: That the judgment and order dated 31st January, 1983 of the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Civil Writ Petition No. 5726 of 1982 be and is hereby set aside and in place thereof an order dismissing the above mentioned Writ Petition filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court be and is hereby substituted; . That the parties herein shall bear their own costs of the said appeal in this Court. . That the order of this court dated 10th December, 1986 passed in the civil miscellaneous petition No. 14226 of 1983 in the said appeal directing the maintenance of status quo, be and is hereby vacated. Hence the Hon'ble Supreme Court has -3- already adjudicated the matter in view of the respondents. Question to release the land at this stage does not arise. When the matter was pending before the Supreme Court, Award was passed on September 23, 1986. The petitioners thereafter kept mum and filed this writ petition only in the year 1991 to lay challenge to the above said notifications and the Award. It is primary grievance of the petitioners that the Award was passed only with regard to land and nothing was provided therein so far as super-structures are concerned. Be that as it may, in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mohanji and another v. State of U.P. And others, JT 1995 (8) S.C. 599, which was followed thereafter in the case of State of Punjab and others v. Sharan Pal Singh and others, Civil Appeals Nos. 11850-53 of 1995, decided on December 14, 1995, impugned notifications and the Award cannot be quashed. The petitioners, if aggrieved for non-grant of compensation, for the superstructures could have filed claim under Section 18 of the Act. Further contention of counsel for the petitioners that by shifting the proposed road to the adjoining area, the constructed house of the petitioners could have been saved is of no substance at this stage. This plea was raised before the Supreme Court and was rejected while upholding the issuance of notifications. It is also contended by counsel for the petitioners that on a representation made by them, the matter was reconsidered by the competent authority. A report was made by the O.S.D. , Revenue Department, on May 22, 2007, stating that the road could not be constructed -4- at the spot on account of resistance caused by the petitioners and further that the proposed alternative road, may be more suitable. At this stage, it is not possible for us to interfere in the acquisition, which had become final in the year 1987. The area could not be used for the purpose for which it was acquired because firstly the acquisition proceedings were quashed by this Court and thereafter the Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the acquisition in the year 1987. The construction raised was in existence when the acquisition was upheld. It is not case of the petitioners that in the intervening period, they have raised the construction. The road could not be constructed because of resistance shown by the petitioners. No case is made out for interference. This writ petition is dismissed. CWP No. 8898 of 1991: So far as CWP No. 8898 of 1991 is concerned, in this case it is primary grievance of the petitioners that Award and the Notifications, vide which the land was acquired, be quashed because no compensation was awarded for the super-structures when award was passed on April 11, 1991. For the reasons given in the earlier part of this judgment, no case is made out for interference in this case also. Dismissed. CWP No. 8811 of 1996: By filing CWP No. 8811 of 1996, notification issued under Section 4 of the Act on June 7, 1993, and further notification issued under Section 6 of the Act on January 3, 1994, are under challenge. Further challenge has been laid to an award passed on February 14, 1996. This petition was filed in the month of June, 1996. In view of ratio of the judgment in Star Wire(India) Ltd. v. State of Haryana, (1996) 11 SCC -5- , this writ petition having been filed after passing of an award cannot be entertained. Furthermore, by the time this writ petition was filed, most of the area was utilised for the purpose for which it was acquired. Dismissed.\n\n( JASBIR SINGH ) JUDGE (AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH) JUDGE December 03 , 2010. DKC",

Ghuman, Advocate for the appellants. Mr. Arun Palli, Senior Advocate with Mr. Divanshu Jain and Mr. Tushar Sharma, Advocates for respondent No.2 (In all the appeals) T.S. Thakur, C.J. (Oral)\n\nThese appeals arise out of similar but separate orders, all dated 26.3.1992, passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court whereby Civil Writ Petitions No. 7570 to 7575, 8249, 8250 to 8253 and of 1991 have been disposed of with a direction to the petitioner- Municipal Committee, who is the appellant herein, to pay 30% of back wages to the respondent-workmen for the period commencing from the date of their termination till the date of their reinstatement. The facts leading to the filing of the writ petitions and the present appeals may be briefly stated as under: The respondents, in these appeals, were employed by the appellant-Municipal\n\nCommittee,\n\nPatiala,\n\nas\n\nMalis-cum- Chowkidars/Beldars in which capacity they continued working for a period ranging between one to one and a half years. Their services having been terminated suddenly without any notice or enquiry, whatsoever, they appear to have raised an industrial dispute culminating in a reference to the Labour Court for determination of the following common question:- Whether termination of services of Sh. Amarjeet Singh (name of the workman in each case is different) is justified and in order? If not, to what relief/extent amount of compensation is he entitled?\n\nOn receipt of the reference, the Labour Court framed two issues for determination, namely:- ) Whether the reference is bad in law as per preliminary objections of the written statement? ) Whether the order of termination of services of the workman is justified and in order?\n\nThe parties were permitted to adduce evidence in support of their respective cases, upon appreciation whereof, the Labour Court eventually came to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong with the reference made by the Government and that the termination of services of the workmen, being without any charge sheet and any enquiry, whatsoever, against them, was clearly illegal. The Court also held that the case of the Municipal Committee that the workmen had themselves abandoned their appointments and left, was totally unconvincing. The Labour Court, accordingly, set aside the termination and directed reinstatement of all the workmen/respondents with continuity of service. Since the Committee had failed to produce any cogent evidence to prove that the workmen had remained gainfully employed during the period of their forced idleness, the Labour Court also declared the workmen entitled to their reinstatement with continuity of service and full back wages.\n\nAggrieved by the order passed by the Labour Court, the Municipal Committee filed Civil Writ Petition Nos. 7570 to 7575, 8249, to 8253 and 9105 of 1991 in this Court which were heard and eventually disposed of by N.C. Jain, J., as his Lordship then was, by similar but separate orders, all dated 26.3.1992, as noticed earlier. The learned Single Judge was of the view that the issues raised by the Committee, in the writ petitions, involved disputed questions of facts, which the Court was not inclined to examine. It was further observed that the workmen had consented to the disposal of the writ petitions with a direction to the Committee to pay 30% of the actual wages, due to them for the period they remained out of job and to reinstate the workmen with continuity of service. Learned Single Judge observed:- XXX XXX XXX XX Since disputed questions of facts are involved, this Court is disinclined to go into the same. When the case was in progress during the arguments on certain dates of hearing, the workmen were agreeable to have 50 per cent of the back wages. Today at the very outset, the counsel for the workmen after taking instructions from them who are present in Court, has consented that his clients are willing to have back wages to the extent of 30 per cent of the actual wages which are due to them provided they are ordered to be reinstated forthwith with the benefits of continuity of service. It has further been submitted by the counsel for the workmen that his clients may also be considered for regularization of their services favourably and if this is ordered, the workmen would be satisfied with only per cent of the back wages as per the wages under the law . The present appeals question the correctness of the above judgment and order, as noticed above. When these appeals came up before us on 4.8.2009, Mr. Arun Palli, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents, pointed out that the respondents, except Ram Pal who had passed away during the pendency of writ petition, had been regularized in service as Beldars, by the appellant-Committee.\n\nMr. Ghuman appearing for the appellant-Municipal Committee, Patiala, which has in due course become a Corporation, sought time to verify the true position and make his submissions. Mr. Ghuman submits, today, on instructions, that all the respondents, except deceased Ram Pal, have been regularized in service as Beldars pursuant to a policy formulated by the Government in that connection. He further stated that so far as payment of back wages is concerned, while the payment of % of back wages to all other respondents remains to be made, the amount payable to Jagiro widow of Ram Pal has already been released in her favour. He urged that this Court could, notwithstanding the said subsequent developments and regularization of services of the respondents, examine whether the order passed by the Labour Court and upheld by learned Single Judge was legally valid in the eyes of law. He contended that the very fact that the respondents have been regularized in service does not make any material difference, especially when the respondents had not been appointed on the basis of any valid process of recruitment at the time of their initial appointment, and that regularization of employees who had joined the service without going through a proper selection process, has not been favoured by the Hon'ble Apex Court. On behalf of the respondents, Mr. Palli, on the other hand, contended that the issue regarding regularization of services of the respondents does not strictly speaking, arise for consideration in these proceedings as the appellant-Corporation had, on its own, regularized their services upon the respondents fulfilling the conditions stipulated for such regularization in terms of the policy formulated by the Government. He further argued that once the regularization had been ordered by the Corporation, it was no longer open to it to find fault with the method of recruitment adopted by the Municipality or grudge the regularization which was due to the respondents on the Municipal Corporation's own showing.\n\nIn so far as payment of back wages is concerned, Mr. Palli pointed out that the respondents had agreed to forego 70% of their back wages only because the Court was issuing a direction for their regularization. At any rate, the amount of back wages, according to Mr. Palli, was less than a sum of Rs.6,000/- per employee, having regard to the fact that the respondents were receiving Rs.540/- to Rs.600/- per month only and the period for which such wages were payable was limited to only 32 months between the date of their termination and the date of their reinstatement. He submitted that at any rate the entire claim towards back wages for the period from the date of termination till the date of reinstatement could be limited to Rs.5,000/- in each one of these cases in full and final settlement of the claim of the respondents in that connection to avoid any confusion or controversy arising between the parties as to the quantification of the liability in future. There is, in our opinion, considerable merit in the submissions made by Mr. Palli. The termination of the services of the respondents has been found by the Labour Court to be wholly unjustified as the same was neither preceded by any charge sheet or enquiry against any one of them nor any allegation of misconduct was ever made against the said respondents. The version given by the Corporation that the respondents had, on their own, abandoned their jobs was also rightly disbelieved by the Labour Court. In the circumstances, there was nothing wrong with the direction issued by the Labour Court that termination of services of the respondents was legally bad. So also the consequential direction that the Committee shall reinstate the respondents with back wages could not be found fault with having regard to the fact that the termination itself was found to be illegal and there was nothing on record to show that the respondents had been gainfully employed during the period they were forced out of employment. Be that as it may, the respondents had, in the writ petition, consented to the order passed by the Labour Court being modified to the extent that instead of full back wages they would be satisfied in case back wages to the extent of 30% were awarded in their favour and their services regularized. The learned Single Judge accepted that submission and accordingly disposed of the writ petitions holding that the Corporation would reinstate the respondents with continuity of service and 30% back wages to them. The order regarding payment of back wages was, however, stayed by this Court in the present appeals and regularization, if any granted, directed to remain subject to the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. It is in that background that the respondents appear to have been considered for regularization in accordance with the scheme which the Government has formulated and found eligible for the same as early as in the year 2001 onwards. Nine years after the said regularization, it is neither open to the appellant- Corporation nor otherwise fair to put a question mark on the said regularization. The respondents have served as regular employees of the Corporation all these years. Even otherwise, the award made by the Labour Court is of the year 1990 i.e. nearly two decades old. We, therefore, have no hesitation in holding that the question of regularization of the respondents on the basis of the award made by the Labour court is no longer open to any debate or discussion, the same having been settled by the Municipality on its own in accordance with the scheme formulated in that regard.\n\nThe only question that remains to be considered is whether we ought to interfere with the direction issued by learned Single Judge to the extent he has awarded back wages to the respondents at the rate of 30% of such wages. The said direction, as noticed earlier, had proceeded on the consent of the respondents given during the course of arguments before learned Single Judge. But for the said consent the respondents may have been able to support the directions of full back wages also. At any rate, we need not go into the question whether the respondents are entitled to anything more than 30% back wages as Mr. Palli has reiterated his submissions made before learned Single Judge that the respondents are satisfied with 30% back wages only. In fairness to Mr. Palli, we must also record that he was agreeable to this Court putting at rest the controversy as to the amount actually payable to the respondents by quantifying the same at Rs.5,000/- in each one of the cases. Such being the position and keeping in view the fact that the amount is not so fabulous so as to make it difficult for the Corporation to pay the same, we see no compelling reason for us to interfere with the direction issued by learned Single Judge. We, accordingly, dismiss these appeals with the direction that the arrears of Rs.5,000/- payable to each one of the respondents except to the widow of Ram Pal who has already been paid, shall be released in favour of the said respondents, expeditiously, but not later than six months from the date of this order, failing which the said amount shall start earning interest at the rate of % per annum from the date the period of six months expires till the date of actual payment. No costs. (T.S.Thakur) Chief Justice (Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\nJudge August 10, 2009\n\nDK",

Mr.Ashish Gupta, AAG Haryana, for the State. -- Rakesh Kumar Garg,J.(oral). This judgment shall dispose of two appeals i.e. RFA No.1695 of1990 which has been filed by the claimants for enhancement of compensation and RFA No.1876 of 1990, filed on behalf of the State of Haryana seeking reduction of the compensation, challenging the award of Reference Court dated 19.4.1990 passed in LAC No. 27 of 1990 (titled as Jeava Singh v. State of Haryana). Vide notification dated 7.1.1988 published in Haryana Government Gazette, issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, ( for short `the Act'), Government of Haryana, notified the land in dispute measuring 2 kanal 11 marlas situated in village Bijjarpur Tangori , Tehsil Thanesar, District Kurukshetra, with intention to acquire the same for a public purpose,namely, for allotment of residential plots to landless/ homeless members of backward classes and economically weaker section of the village. Notification dated 25.4.1988 was published under section 6 of the Act, declaring that the land measuring 2 kanal 11 marlas was acquired for the public purpose mentioned above. The landowners were given an opportunity to file objections. After hearing the objections Award No.6 dated 30.6.1988 was pronounced by the Land Acquisition Collector fixing compensation at the rate of Rs.20,000/- per acre for Chahi land, Rs.15000/- per acre for Barani land, Rs.12,000/- per acre for Banjar Jadeed, Rs.8000/- per acre for Banjar Kadeem land and Rs.6000/- per acre for gair mumkin.. It is not in dispute that the land in dispute is Chahi in nature. The landowners/appellants were also awarded solatium at the rate of 30% along with variation charges at the rate of 15% of the compensation amount. However, no interest was awarded as possession was not taken till the date of the award, was announced. Aggrieved against the aforesaid award of the Collector, landowners filed reference under Section 18 of the Act, contending that the market value determined by the Land Acquisition Collector was inadequate and he has failed to take into consideration the prevailing market value of the land in question. Application was contested by the State of Haryana submitting that the compensation awarded by the Collector was quite adequate and market value was fixed taking taking into consideration relevant factors for the said purpose. On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed:- . What was the market value of the acquired land at the time of issue of notification under section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act ?OPP . Relief. After considering the evidence on record, vide the impugned award the Reference Court fixed market value of the land at the rate of Rs.40,000/- per acre for Chahi land. The claimants were also held entitled to all the statutory benefits as per the Amendment Act of 1984. However, the variation charges at the rate of 15% awarded by the Collector were ordered to be deleted, as the same were not permissible in law. Still feeling dissatisfied, the appellant has approached this Court by way of the instant appeal, for further enhancement of the compensation awarded to him. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the record of the case with their help. It is not in dispute that the acquired land was agricultural in nature at the time of acquisition. It has also been established on record that the same was near to the village abadi. It may also be relevant to mention that the sale instances produced on record by the State depict that the average sale price of the land was Rs.15233/- and Rs.19254/-. It may also be noticed that there is nothing on file to prove that the lands of these two sale instances was also situated in the same locality. On the other hand sale deed Ex.P1 dated 2.7.1987 vide which 4 marlas of land was sold for Rs.3000/- denotes the average sale price of Rs.1,20,000/- and it has also come on record that the land under the said sale instances is similarly situated as the acquired land. However, it is well settled that even the sale instances pertaining to small piece of land can be considered while determining the value of a big chunk of land after applying a suitable cut. Keeping in view the fact that land was measuring 4 marlas was sold vide sale stance Ex.P1 and that the total land acquired in question is 2 Kanal 11 marlas, this Court feels that a cut off 25% on the said sale price be applied in the instant case. Thus, after applying the said cut, the rate of the land comes to Rs.90,000/- per acre. It may also be noticed that the said sale instance is dated 2.7.1987 whereas the acquisition has taken place after about six months i.e. 7.1.1988. Thus, the appellant is also entitled to a suitable increase in the market value of the land keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case. This Court is of the view that the market value of the land in question should have been determined at Rs.100,000/- per acre. In view of the above, RFA No.1695 of 1990 filed by the claimants is allowed and RFA No.1876 of 1990 filed by the State of Haryana is dismissed. The market value of the land in question is determined at the rate of Rs.1,00,000/-per acre. The appellant is also entitled to all the statutory benefits as permissible.

This writ petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India has been filed with a prayer to quash the orders dated December 31, (Annexure P-8), August 1, 1985 (Annexure P-10) passed by respondent Nos.1 and 2 respectively, vide which the land measuring .60 square metres in possession of the petitioners situated in Rakh Shikargarh Area on GT Road Bye-pass near junction of Fatehgarh Churian Road, Amritsar, was declared surplus in purported exercise of the powers conferred under Section 10(1) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 (Central Act No.33 of 1976) Needless to say that the impugned orders dated December 31, (Annexure P-8) and August 1, 1985 (Annexure P-10) were also -2- passed under the afore-stated 1976 Act only. Vide order dated November 6, 1985 this writ petition was admitted and was ordered to be heard along with Civil Writ Petition No.2244 of 1985 but no stay was given to the petitioner qua the afore- mentioned land which was declared surplus with them. The case was taken up for final hearing on July 14, 2004, when it was brought to the notice of the Court that the counsel for the petitioners had died. The Registry was accordingly directed to send notices to the petitioners for September 29, 2004. In response thereto, the office reported that petitioners No.1 & 2 (Kishanchand Savlani and Smt.Ratna Savlani) have died. Thereafter Civil.Misc.Nos.19122 and 19150 of 2005 were moved for impleading the legal representatives of the deceased petitioners No.1 and 2. The same were allowed vide order dated February 03, 2006 and petitioner No.3-being the sole legal heir of petitioner Nos.1 and 2, was ordered to be impleaded as their legal representative. It is fairly conceded by Shri B.S.Baath, learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab, that the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 has since been repealed vide the Central Ordinance No.5 of 1999 with effect from 22.3.1999 as has been notified by the Government of Punjab, Department of Housing and Urban Development vide their notification No.7/1/99-3HGI-1899 dated 30.5.2000. As a result thereof, the proceedings under the 1976 Act have come to an end in the State of Punjab. In their written reply dated 8.2.2007 filed on behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2, it is not disputed that notwithstanding the declaration of excess area under the repealed Act of 1976, the petitioners -3- continue to retain possession of the subject property. Since the Act has been repealed during the pendency of this writ petition and the proceedings initiated thereunder have not yet attained finality and the possession of the properties also remained with the petitioner, in my view, further proceedings under the afore-mentioned Act no longer survive and stand lapsed, particularly when no saving clause of any kind in the Repealing Act has been brought to the notice of this Court. As a necessary consequence, the action which culminated into passing of the impugned orders dated December 31, 1984 and August 1, 1985 (Annexures P-8 and P-10) has also lost legal back-up rendering the same in- operative. Shri M.L.Saggar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner also accepts the legal and factual position that no cause of action survives in favour of the petitioner after repealing of the 1976 Act as the orders passed thereunder having become inoperative. Consequently and in view of the stand taken by learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab, as stated above, this writ petition has been rendered infructuous and is disposed of accordingly. No costs.

This writ petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India has been filed with a prayer to quash the orders dated December 31, (Annexure P-8), August 1, 1985 (Annexure P-10) passed by respondent Nos.1 and 2 respectively, vide which the land measuring .60 square metres in possession of the petitioners situated in Rakh Shikargarh Area on GT Road Bye-pass near junction of Fatehgarh Churian Road, Amritsar, was declared surplus in purported exercise of the powers conferred under Section 10(1) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 (Central Act No.33 of 1976) Needless to say that the impugned orders dated December 31, (Annexure P-8) and August 1, 1985 (Annexure P-10) were also -2- passed under the afore-stated 1976 Act only. Vide order dated November 6, 1985 this writ petition was admitted and was ordered to be heard along with Civil Writ Petition No.2244 of 1985 but no stay was given to the petitioner qua the afore- mentioned land which was declared surplus with them. The case was taken up for final hearing on July 14, 2004, when it was brought to the notice of the Court that the counsel for the petitioners had died. The Registry was accordingly directed to send notices to the petitioners for September 29, 2004. In response thereto, the office reported that petitioners No.1 & 2 (Kishanchand Savlani and Smt.Ratna Savlani) have died. Thereafter Civil.Misc.Nos.19122 and 19150 of 2005 were moved for impleading the legal representatives of the deceased petitioners No.1 and 2. The same were allowed vide order dated February 03, 2006 and petitioner No.3-being the sole legal heir of petitioner Nos.1 and 2, was ordered to be impleaded as their legal representative. It is fairly conceded by Shri B.S.Baath, learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab, that the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 has since been repealed vide the Central Ordinance No.5 of 1999 with effect from 22.3.1999 as has been notified by the Government of Punjab, Department of Housing and Urban Development vide their notification No.7/1/99-3HGI-1899 dated 30.5.2000. As a result thereof, the proceedings under the 1976 Act have come to an end in the State of Punjab. In their written reply dated 8.2.2007 filed on behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2, it is not disputed that notwithstanding the declaration of excess area under the repealed Act of 1976, the petitioners -3- continue to retain possession of the subject property. Since the Act has been repealed during the pendency of this writ petition and the proceedings initiated thereunder have not yet attained finality and the possession of the properties also remained with the petitioner, in my view, further proceedings under the afore-mentioned Act no longer survive and stand lapsed, particularly when no saving clause of any kind in the Repealing Act has been brought to the notice of this Court. As a necessary consequence, the action which culminated into passing of the impugned orders dated December 31, 1984 and August 1, 1985 (Annexures P-8 and P-10) has also lost legal back-up rendering the same in- operative.

The assessment in question relates to residential property situated within the municipal limits of Sangrur. The property is stated to be owned by respondent No. 2. At the time of assessment of house tax, a notice was issued to him by Executive Officer, Muncipal Committee, Sangrur. After hearing the objections, the annual rental value was determined at Rs. 3000/- for the rented portion and Rs. 3,000/- for self occupied portion vide assessment order dated 28.01.1987 (Annexure P-1). Respondent No. 2 appealed against the said order before the Sub-Divisional Officer (Civil), Sangrur. But after hearing the parties, Sub-Divisional Officer (Civil) observed that no portion of house was let-out. He, thus, set-aside the assessment order in so far it pertained to portion purportedly let out and reduced the assessment in respect of self occupied portion from Rs. 3,000/- to Rs. 28,00/-. Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the order passed by the appellate authority is unsustainable. According to him, the authority could not have exempted the rented portion from assessment of house tax. He has also assailed the finding of appellate court to the effect that house was not rented out. Learned counsel, therefore, prays that matter may be remanded back to the same authority for decision afresh. No reply has been filed on behalf of the respondents. The prayer for remand is, however, not opposed by learned State counsel. I have heard counsel for the parties and given careful thought to the facts of the case. From the order passed by appellate authority, it is not clear whether the assessment order was passed in respect of entire residential property in question or part thereof, nor is it specified how a finding of fact was arrived at by the appellate authority that the house was not rented out.

Resultantly, impugned order dated 24.07.1987, Annexure P-2 passed by appellate authority is hereby set-aside. The matter is remitted back to the same authority for taking a fresh decision after hearing the parties. The parties are directed to remain present before the appellate authority on 05.03.2010.

Ms.Meenakshi Verma, Additional A.G. Haryana. Shri Atul Lakhanpal, Senior Advocate with Shri Arjun Lakhanpal, Advocate. MAHESH GROVER, J. The petitioner impugns the order of his retrenchment. He was working as a Technical Supervisor with respondent No.2. i.e. the Haryana State Small Industries & Export Corporation Ltd. when he along with other similarly situated persons faced retrenchment. The rentrechment was necessitated on account of the closure of the Corporation which fact is controverted by the counsel for the respondents who contends that only one unit was closed. This plea of the petitioner has been vehemently controverted by the respondents who has asserted that the entire Corporation had since been closed and its operations wound up. C.W.P. No.732 of 1992 -2- There is no such material on record from where it can be inferred that the Corporation has been wound up. But the counsel for the petitioner certainly admits that one unit of the Corporation has been closed. There is no order to this effect also on record. So even if the statement of the counsel for the petitioner is accepted to be correct, then also there is nothing on record to show that a rehabilitation policy was formulated by the respondents to adjust the retrenched employees. It was incumbent for the petitioner to place on record such a policy in the event of seeking such a benefit therefrom. In the absence of any such material, this Court has been precluded from evaluating as to whether the petitioner was entitled to rehabilitation more particularly when it has been shown by the respondents that the Corporation or a part thereof employing the petitioner is no longer in existence. Apart from that, even if the best case of the petitioner is accepted, he would have been entitled to adjustment as per the policy, if any and this would have made him entitled to a benefit which today can be termed to be illusory, as he would not have got any monetary benefits from the respondents on account of such an adjustment on the principle of 'no pay for no work'. For all intents and purposes, the instant petition has been rendered infructuous as the petitioner who preferred the petition, has expired and the writ petition is being prosecuted by his legal representatives.

These petitions have been filed challenging the order passed by the Director, Higher Education, Haryana, Chandigarh, CWP No.3223 of 1988 2 withdrawing the interim benefit earlier granted to the petitioners and consequential recovery. It appears that the petitioners working in various schools were granted benefit of interim relief with effect from .12..1985 on the pattern of the University Grants Commission Grades. The first instalment was released and thereafter on consideration of the matter, the impugned order dated 12.5.1987, Annexure P-3 (in CWP No.3223 of 1988) has been passed withdrawing the benefit/relief and the excess amount is sought to be recovered. In the reply filed by the respondents it is stated that on the basis of the letters dated 2.8.1983 and 29..4.1985 issued from the Government of India, on the recommendation of 4th Pay Commission, the Government of Haryana sanctioned two instalments of interim relief. After disbursement of the first instalment and at the time of the disbursement of the second instalment, it came to the notice of the authorities that the payment has been made in violation of the instructions Annexure P-2. On that basis, impugned order came to be passed. Mr.RK Malik, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that he has instructions to say that the petitioners do not dispute the refixation of their pay or withdrawal of the benefit, but confine relief only to the recovery part. From the reply, it appears neither fraud nor misrepresentation is attributed to the petitioners. It was only on the basis of the interpretation of the government instructions that the CWP No.3223 of 1988 3 amount was paid to the petitioners. The issue involved in the present writ petitions is squarely covered by a Full Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Budh Ram and others Vs. State of Haryana and others (CWP No.2799 of 2009) decided on 22.5.2009 wherein the following observations have been made:- We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that in case the employees who are recipient of the benefits extended to them on an erroneous interpretation or application of any rule, regulation, circular and instructions have not been any way contributed to such erroneous interpretation or have they committed any fraud, misrepresentation, deception to obtain the grant of such benefit, the benefit so extended may be stopped for the future, but the amount already paid to the employees cannot be recovered from them. In view of the above, the present writ petitions are partly allowed while upholding the refixation/withdrawal of the relief, the recovery against the petitioners is hereby quashed.

This petition --2-- was accepted by the said Director vide order dated 05.02.1996. The following operative order was passed:- In view of these facts, I accept the petition, amend the scheme and send the case to the Consolidation Officer (Tehsildar), Nabha for distribution of the excess land amongst the right holders and the correction of entries in the record accordingly. It is, however, ordered that members of the Schedules Castes and others in occupation of the land, in question, will not be dispossessed except in due course of law. To be communicated .

Nos. 811 of 1991, 812 of 1991, 813 of 1991 and 1686 of 1991 as all these four appeals have been preferred by land owners for enhancement of compensation, as awarded by learned Additional District Judge, Faridkot, vide impugned Award dated 01.12.1990, whereby petitions filed by the appellants and many other land owners under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (in short the Act) were disposed of. State Government, vide notification dated 10.01.1986 issued under Section 4 of the Act, notified land measuring 62 kanals 05 marlas situated in the revenue estate of Village Dhilwan Kalan for acquisition for public purpose namely for straightening of portion of National Highway No. 15. Land Acquisition Collector, vide Award No. 1 dated 18.06.1986, determined market value of the acquired land @ Rs.30,000/- per acre for nehri land measuring 60 kanals 01 marla and @ Rs.20,000/- per acre for the remaining gair mumkin chhappar (01 kanal 06 marlas) and gair mumkin rasta (18 marlas). The land owners were not satisfied with the compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition Collector and therefore, filed petitions under Section 18 of the Act claiming compensation at enhanced rate alleging that market value of the acquired land was Rs.1,00,000/- per acre. It may be noticed that before the Land Acquisition Collector, the land owners claimed the market value of the acquired land to be Rs.45,000/- per acre only for nehri land. The respondents controverted the stand of the land owners by filing written statement and pleaded that the Land Acquisition Collector has awarded compensation as per market value. Following common issued were framed in the cases :- 1. Whether the compensation paid is inadequate ? If so, what compensation should have been paid ? OPA . Whether the application is not maintainable in the present form ? OPR . Relief. Learned Additional District Judge, Faridkot vide impugned Award dated 01.12.1990, determined the market value of the acquired land to be Rs.37,000/- per acre for nehri land and Rs.27,000/- per acre for the remaining land under issue no.1. Issue no.2 was decided against the respondents as neither pressed nor proved. The reference petitions were accordingly disposed of by awarding compensation for the acquired land at the aforesaid rates. Feeling dissatisfied, the land owners have filed the instant appeals. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case files. Santa Singh land owner (AW-1) and Sodagar Singh land owner (AW-2) have stated about location of the acquired land. They also stated that its market value was Rs.1,00,000/- per acre at the time of acquisition. Dhanna Singh retired SDO (AW-3) proved site plan (Ex.A-1) regarding location of the acquired land. He also proved aks masavi (Ex.A- ) besides his report (Ex.A-3). The land owners also tendered in evidence judgment dated 09.04.1990 (Ex.A-4) passed by this Court in R. F. A. No. of 1988 titled Jai Kaur vs. State of Punjab and another, whereby bunch of appeals relating to land acquired for establishment of new mandi at Kot Kapura were disposed of, determining the market value to be Rs.37/- per square yard. The land owners also produced copy of sale deed dated .06.1987 (Ex.A-5) relating to a plot measuring 01 kanal 5-1/3 marlas situated in abadi of Village Dhilwan Kalan for Rs.25,333/- i.e. at the rate of Rs.1,60,000/- per acre. On the other hand, respondents produced copies of three sale deeds Ex.R-2 to Ex.R-4. Sale deeds Ex.R-2 and Ex.R-3 are both dated .06.1985 regarding sale of 16 kanals land each for Rs.46,000/- i.e. @ Rs.23,000/- per acre. Sale deed Ex.R-4 dated 24.07.1985 is regarding sale of 03 kanals land for Rs.9,000/- i.e. @ Rs.24,000/- per acre. Learned Additional District Judge found judgment Ex.A-4 of this Court to be not of comparable land and also found sale instance Ex.A-5 produced by the land owners to be not a comparable sale instance. Similarly, sale instances vide sale deeds Ex.R-2 to Ex.R-4 produced by the respondents were also found to be not comparable sale instances because even the Land Acquisition Collector has awarded compensation at a higher rate than depicted by these sale instances. However, learned Additional District Judge, taking into consideration the location of the acquired land along the National Highway and taking into consideration other circumstances, enhanced the market value of the acquired land by Rs.7,000/- per acre. Learned counsel for the appellants vehemently contended that judgment Ex.A-4 of this Court pertains to land in Kot Kapura, which is at a distance of about 3 kilometers only from the acquired land and therefore judgment Ex.A-4 should be taken into consideration for determining the market value of the acquired land. The contention cannot be accepted. Santa Singh (AW-1) stated that the acquired land is 2 to 3 kilometers from the Grain Market, Kot Kapura, to which judgment Ex. A-4 relates. Sodagar Singh (AW-2) stated the said distance to be 2 kilometers. Dhanna Singh (AW-3) stated the said distance to be 3 kilometers. However, learned Additional District Judge has observed that in scaled site plan Ex. A-1, prepared by Dhanna Singh (AW-3), scale used is 1 inch = 100 meters and the distance between Grain Market and acquired land is about 3 feet in the site plan. Calculated in this manner, the distance would come to about 4.2 kilometers. Moreover, the acquired land of judgment Ex. A-4 was situated within municipal limits of Kot Kapura. Acquired land in the instant cases is situated in Village Dhilwan Kalan. Abadi of Dhilwan Kalan intervenes the acquired land and Grain Market of Kot Kapura. The acquired land is one kilometer away on the other side from abadi of Village Dhilwan Kalan. In this view of the matter, judgment Ex.A-4 has no relevance in determining the market value of acquired land in the instant case. Even a small distance within municipal limits may result in vast difference in market value of land. Moreover, the acquired land involved in judgment Ex.A-4 was found suitable for residential and commercial purposes, in view of location thereof. The acquired land of that case was on the junction of two roads i.e. Kot Kapura Bathinda Road and Kot Kapura Moga Road and there was also 3 karams vide kacha passage on third side of the said land. There were shops on both sides of Kot Kapura Bathinda Road as well as Kot Kapura Moga Road, besides FCI godown, petrol pump and bus stand near the said land. There was also a cinema hall on the Bathinda Road besides large number of buildings adjoining the acquired land. There were also shops in the acquired land of that case. Consequently, there is no comparison of the acquired land of that case with acquired land of the instant case. Sale deed Ex.A-5 has also rightly been discarded by the Reference Court because the said sale deed pertains to a small residential plot in the abadi, whereas the acquired land is a big chunk of agricultural land situated about one kilometer away from abadi. Moreover, sale deed Ex.A-5 was executed about 1 years after notification under Section 4 of the Act and the same could have been manipulated to claim enhanced compensation. In any event, the said sale deed is not comparable sale instance as it relates to a plot of abadi area. Sale instances Ex.R-2 to Ex.R-4 produced by the respondents are somewhat comparable sale instances because the same relate to sale of agricultural land just 6-7 months prior to the date of notification under Section 4 of the Act. Land of these sale deeds has been depicted in site plan Ex. R-1 and the same is just near the acquired land. Land of sale deed Ex.R-2 even abuts the National Highway. According to the sale deeds Ex.R-2 to Ex.R-4, the market value of the land was Rs.23,000/- to Rs.24,000/- per acre only. However, these sale instances were ignored by the Reference Court because even the Land Acquisition Collector has awarded compensation at higher rate. Learned counsel for the appellants next emphatically contended that the acquired land was located on National Highway and therefore, had potential value. Learned counsel for the appellants relying on four judgments of this Court in the cases of Surat Singh vs. State of Haryana reported as 2000 (1) R.C.R. (Civil) 349, Bhulla Ram alias Bhola, Bhola Ram vs. State of Haryana reported as 1996 (1) R.R.R. 761, Binkal Kumar vs. State of Haryana and another reported as 1991 (1) R.R.R. and Smt. Bindu Garg vs. State of Haryana reported as 1999 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 261 contended that in view of location of the acquired land on National Highway, the land owners are entitled to enhanced compensation. The contention cannot be accepted because learned Additional District Judge, after taking into consideration the location of the acquired land on the National Highway, has enhanced the market value by Rs.7,000/- per acre for the acquired land, notwithstanding that no evidence of any comparable sale instances was adduced by the land owners. The compensation awarded by the Reference Court cannot be said to be less than the market value of the acquired land on the date of notification under Section 4 of the Act, in any manner. The Reference Court has already taken a favourable view for the land owners. In view of the aforesaid, I find no merit in these appeals, which are accordingly dismissed. May 26, 2009\n\n( L. N.

Even without -2- joining on the issue of discrepancy, I am still not convinced that the insurer had discharged the burden of proof effectively enough. A communication from the licensing authority that the particular licence was verified, cannot be taken at its face value and it has to be established before the Tribunal through appropriate evidence by summoning the original register and getting a witness connected with the document to speak about the entry. The insurer cannot be said to have discharged the burden of proof properly and I would hold the insurer liable not merely to satisfy the claim of the claimants but also to indemnify the insured. .

The Insurance Company is in appeal against the judgment of the MACT contending that in spite of the fact that the driver who drove the vehicle was proved to have had a fake driving licence, the liability is wrongly cast on it. . The liability of the Insurance Co in a case of a fake licence or a renewal of a licence which was a fake one have been considered by the Hon ble Supreme Court in several cases and the decisions in National Insurance Co v Swaran Singh (2004) 3 SCC 297 and United Indian Insurance v Divinder Singh (2007) 8 SCC 342 are instructive. In the latter judgment, it has been held that a renewal of a fake driving licence is no licence at all and hence the insurer shall not be liable. . It was even held earlier by the Hon ble Supreme Court, while referring to the effect of a renewal of forged licence, in New India Assurance Co., Shimla v. Kamla,(2001) 4 SCC 342: . The observation of the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sucha -2 Singh that renewal of a document which purports to be a driving licence, will robe even a forged document with validity on account of Section 15 of the Act, propounds a very dangerous proposition. If that proposition is allowed to stand as a legal principle, it may, no doubt, thrill counterfeiters the world over as they would be encouraged to manufacture fake documents in a legion. What was originally a forgery would remain null and void forever and it would not acquire legal validity at any time by whatever process of sanctification subsequently done on it. Forgery is antithesis to legality and law cannot afford to validate a forgery. . The judgment of the Supreme Court in Swaran Singh (supra) has an immediate relevance for us in this case for the effect of proof of fake licence in the context of the need for discharging the burden of proof on the Insurance company that the insured had committed a breach of terms of the policy. The fact that the driver had a fake licence will absolve the insurer of the liability of the insurer only, if it is established that the accident was on account of reasons where the possession of valid driving licence will have relevance for consideration of the aspect of negligence that has to be proved. If the accident was on account of say, mechanical defect in the vehicle, the issue of the validity of licence will have no relevance. . In this case, the driver has not examined himself and there is no evidence about the licence except the copy of the driving licence, which is produced and whose genuineness has been the subject of evidence through an officer of the licensing authority with reference to the official document. The owner has remained ex parte and no evidence is available about his bonafides of enquiry regarding the possession of driving licence by the driver before its entrustment to him. Consequently, the insured shall not have the benefit of indemnity under the policy. . Even if the insurance company is not liable, the -3 duty to satisfy the award for the claimants cannot be doubted. In such a situation, the liability to satisfy the award will be accompanied with a right of recovery from the owner/insured.

Sub-section (4) of Section 149 of the Act says that so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the person insured by reference to any condition shall as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy ..., be of no effect . The proviso to the said sub-section is important for the purpose of considering the question involved in this case and hence that proviso is extracted below: Provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability of any person which is covered by the policy by virtue only of this sub-section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person. . Similarly, in this context sub-section (5) is equally important and hence that is also extracted below: 149. (5) If the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this section to pay in respect of a liability incurred by a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which the insurer would apart from the provisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability, the insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person. . A reading of the proviso to sub-section (4) as well as the language employed in sub-section (5) would indicate that they are intended to safeguard the interest of an insurer who otherwise has no liability to pay any amount to the insured but for the provisions contained in Chapter XI of the Act. This means, the insurer has to pay to the third parties only on account of the fact that a policy of insurance has been issued in respect of the vehicle, but the insurer is entitled to recover any such sum from the insured if the insurer were not otherwise liable to pay such sum to the insured by virtue of the conditions of the contract of insurance indicated by the policy. . To repeat, the effect of the above provisions is this: when a valid insurance policy has been issued in respect of a vehicle as evidenced by a certificate of insurance the burden is on the insurer to pay to the third parties, whether or not there has been any breach or violation of the policy conditions. But the amount so paid by the insurer to third parties can be allowed to be recovered from the insured if as per the policy conditions the insurer had no liability to pay such sum to the insured. . The position can be summed up thus: The insurer and the insured are bound by the conditions enumerated in the policy and the insurer is not liable to the insured if there is violation of any policy condition. But the insurer who is made statutorily liable to pay compensation to third parties on account of the certificate of insurance issued shall be entitled to recover from the insured the -4 amount paid to the third parties, if there was any breach of policy conditions on account of the vehicle being driven without a valid driving licence. Learned counsel for the insured contended that it is enough if he establishes that he made all due enquiries and believed bona fide that the driver employed by him had a valid driving licence, in which case there was no breach of the policy condition. These observations were subsequently cited with approval in Swaran Singh s case (supra) also. . It is, therefore, evident from the discussions made hereinbefore that the liability of the insurance company to satisfy the decree at the first instance and to recover the awarded amount from the owner or driver thereof has been holding the field for a long time. . Apart from the reasons stated hereinbefore, the doctrine of stare decisis persuades us not to deviate from the said principle.\n\n. The summary of our findings to the various issues as raised in these petitions is as follows: (i) Chapter XI of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 providing compulsory insurance of vehicles against third-party risks is a social welfare legislation to extend relief by compensation to victims of accidents caused by use of motor vehicles. The provisions of compulsory insurance coverage of all vehicles are with this paramount object and the provisions of the Act have to be so interpreted as to effectuate the said object. (ii) An insurer is entitled to raise a defence in a claim petition filed under Section 163-A or Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, inter alia, in terms of Section 149(2)(a)(ii) of the said Act. (iii) The breach of policy condition e.g. disqualification of the driver or invalid driving licence of the driver, as contained in sub-section (2)(a)(ii) of Section 149, has to be proved to have been committed by the insured for avoiding liability by the insurer. Mere absence, fake or invalid driving licence or disqualification of the driver for driving at the relevant time, are not in themselves defences available to the insurer against either the insured or the third parties. To avoid its liability towards the insured, the insurer has to prove that the insured was guilty of negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care in the matter of fulfilling the condition of the policy regarding use of vehicles by a duly licensed driver or one who was not disqualified to drive at the relevant time. (iv) Insurance companies, however, with a view to avoid their liability must not only establish the available defence(s) raised in the said proceedings but must also establish breach on the part of the owner of the vehicle; the burden of proof wherefor would be on them. (v) The court cannot lay down any criteria as to how the said burden would be discharged, inasmuch as the same would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. (vi) Even where the insurer is able to prove breach on the part of the insured concerning the policy condition regarding holding of a valid licence by the driver or his qualification to drive during the relevant period, the insurer would not be allowed to avoid its liability towards the insured unless the said breach or breaches on the condition of driving licence is/are so fundamental as are found to have contributed to the cause of the accident. The Tribunals in interpreting the policy conditions would apply the rule of main purpose and the concept of fundamental breach to allow defences available to the insurer under Section 149(2) of the Act. (vii) The question, as to whether the owner has taken reasonable care -5 to find out as to whether the driving licence produced by the driver (a fake one or otherwise), does not fulfil the requirements of law or not will have to be determined in each case. .. (xi) The provisions contained in sub-section (4) with the proviso thereunder and sub-section (5) which are intended to cover specified contingencies mentioned therein to enable the insurer to recover the amount paid under the contract of insurance on behalf of the insured can be taken recourse to by the Tribunal and be extended to claims and defences of the insurer against the insured by relegating them to the remedy before regular court in cases where on given facts and circumstances adjudication of their claims inter se might delay the adjudication of the claims of the victims. . Under the circumstances, the Insurance Company shall not be liable to indemnify the insured. The liability is to satisfy the claim under the award with a right of recovery against the insured. The award of the Tribunal is modified and the appeal allowed to the above extent. (K. KANNAN) JUDGE July 16, 2010 archana",

    "summary": "The judgment of the Supreme Court in Swaran Singh (supra) has an immediate relevance for us in this case for the effect of proof of fake licence in the context of the need for discharging the burden of proof on the Insurance company that the insured had committed a breach of terms of the policy. The fact that the driver had a fake licence will absolve the insurer of the liability of the insurer only, if it is established that the accident was on account of reasons where the possession of valid driving licence will have relevance for consideration of the aspect of negligence that has to be proved. This means, the insurer has to pay to the third parties only on account of the fact that a policy of insurance has been issued in respect of the vehicle, but the insurer is entitled to recover any such sum from the insured if the insurer were not otherwise liable to pay such sum to the insured by virtue of the conditions of the contract of insurance indicated by the policy. (vi) Even where the insurer is able to prove breach on the part of the insured concerning the policy condition regarding holding of a valid licence by the driver or his qualification to drive during the relevant period, the insurer would not be allowed to avoid its liability towards the insured unless the said breach or breaches on the condition of driving licence is/are so fundamental as are found to have contributed to the cause of the accident."

The appellant specifically averred that the respondent has deserted her with ulterior motive and has declined to give food and shelter . On merits, the appellant took the plea that soon after their marriage, the respondent started harassing her for bringing insufficient dowry and did not even attend the marriage of her brother held in the year 1974.

She further alleged that the previous divorce petition was withdrawn by the respondent after stating that he had compromised the matter and shall not beat her and will behave properly in future.

The -: 4 :- appellant specifically averred that she never refused to accompany the respondent, rather it is he who refused to take the respondent to his home . She further averred that since the respondent wanted to turn her out of the matrimonial home, he himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813 Bhatinda and thereafter got filed eviction application against her from his mother alleging therein that she was a tenant in the house. The appellant admitted that she had to approach the Deputy Commissioner Bhatinda as her life and liberty was at stake for the reason that the respondent sent hired unsocial elements at midnight at her residence on 2nd May, 1991 and 4th May, 1991 who was later on caught by the neighbours and was given severe beatings. Fortunately, her father was with her at that time. [5]. In his rejoinder, the respondent husband not only reiterated the allegations, he further averred that since he refused to pay Rs.25,000/- to the brother of the appellant who wanted to expand his business of welding material, she became totally arrogant and threatened him that she will take revenge later on. Admitting the poor eye sight of the appellant, the respondent averred that she is suffering from an inherited disease.... which cannot be cured.... . He denied the allegations that he wanted to re-marry. [6]. On the basis of the pleadings, following issues were framed by the learned trial court:- 1. Whether respondent has deserted the petitioner without any sufficient and reasonable cause? OPA . Whether the respondent is guilty of cruelty as alleged in the petition? OPA . Whether the respondent is entitled to special costs as -: 5 :- alleged in the written statement? OPR . Whether the petitioner has no cause of action and locus standi to file the petition? . Relief. [7]. In order to discharge his onus qua issues No.1 and 2, the respondent examined formal witnesses Prem Kumar (AW1), who is a record-keeper in the Sessions Division at Bhatinda and produced the file of previous divorce petition HMA No.35 dated 28.9.1990 decided on .3.1991 as well as Surjit Singh (AW2), who being Reader to the Court of Additional District Judge Bhatinda on 13.3.1991, had recorded the statements of the parties. The respondent also examined Om Parkash (AW3), ASI Kashmir Singh (AW4), Uzagar Singh (AW5), Amrik Singh (AW6), Constable Dalbir Singh (AW7), Head Constable Gurcharan Kaur (AW8), respondent, himself as (AW9) and Madan Lal Sharma (AW10) and also relied upon documents Ex.A1 to A8. [8]. The appellant, on the other hand, examined her brother Amar Nath Gupta (RW1) and she herself entered the witness box as (RW2). She also relied upon the documents Ex.R1 to R6. [9]. Upon appreciation of the above stated evidence and while deciding the issues No.1 and 2 together, the learned Additional District Judge held that the appellant refused to prepare tea for the visitors, she often abused her husband and made false complaints against him to the police and his colleagues/superiors. The appellant's statement dated 13.3.1991 (Ex.A1) in the previous divorce petition, which was compromised, has also been relied upon to arrive at the aforesaid conclusion. The learned trial court also placed reliance upon Ex.A4, a report alleged to have been made by HC -: 6 :- Gurcharan Kaur and concluded that, there is no rebuttal to documentary evidence of the petitioner regarding the alleged cruelty by the respondent and that the appellant only wanted to extract money from the petitioner by filing various petitions and applications before the police . The learned trial court held that it was a case of causing 'mental cruelty' to the husband who made every effort to join the respondent in his company . The learned trial court further held that the appellant-wife has deserted the respondent without any sufficient and reasonable cause... . Both the issues were accordingly answered against the appellant, resulting into passing of the impugned judgment and decree. [10]. I have heard Learned Counsel for the parties, perused the pleadings, the impugned judgment as well as the evidence on record. [11]. Before adverting to issue No.2, i.e., whether or not the respondent is guilty of cruelty as alleged in the petition , I firstly propose to deal with issue No.1, as to whether she had deserted the respondent without any sufficient and reasonable cause? . [12]. If one reads the petition under Section 13 of the Act dated .10.1991 , it is evident in unequivocal terms that no allegations, what-so- ever, that the appellant ever deserted her husband without any sufficient cause, have been made. The entire petition is founded upon the allegations of cruelty and it is in that process that the respondent in para 8 of the petition has averred that he along with his sons, who are studying in Convent School and DAV College, Bhatinda respectively, have been forced to live in the small rented house . No averment that the appellant voluntarily left her matrimonial home and, thus, deserted the respondent, has been made. In the absence of such allegations, how issue No.1 was -: 7 :- framed, is beyond comprehension. Be that as it may, it is the admitted fact that house no.3880, Neeta Street, behind Gurdwara Singh Sabha, Bhatinda is owned by the respondent or his mother. The parties were admittedly residing in the said house only, as the respondent himself gave the same address for both the parties in his first divorce petition No. HMA35 dated .9.1990. The parties were, thus, residing under the same roof not only in the year 1990 but also at the time when they compromised their matrimonial dispute on 13.3.1991. In para 6 of her written statement, the appellant wife has specifically averred that the respondent husband himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813 Bhatinda . This fact has been admitted by the respondent in para 8 of the divorce petition though in a different manner. Not only this, the appellant admittedly continues to stay in the same house owned by the respondent or his mother even though the respondent attempted to throw her out by getting an eviction petition filed through his mother. The appellant's specific stand that an eviction petition was filed by her mother-in-law alleging her to be a tenant in the premises, has not been controverted by the respondent in his rejoinder. If that is so, the conclusion drawn by the learned trial court that the appellant has deserted her husband without any sufficient cause is totally contrary to the evidence on record. It is the respondent who concededly left the matrimonial home and shifted to a rented accommodation. The finding returned by the learned trial court on issue No.1, therefore, cannot sustain and is accordingly set aside. [13]. This takes us to the crucial issue as to who out of the two subjected the other to cruelty of such a high degree that the matrimonial tie had to be snapped by a decree of divorce. -: 8 :- [14]. At the cost of repetition, it may be noticed that in order to prove the allegation of cruelty at the hands of the appellant, the respondent has alleged that she (i) refused to cook meals for the family; (ii) levelled false allegations on the character of the respondent; (iii) gave beatings to the mother of the respondent; (iv) admitted these allegations in her statement on .3.1991 in the previous divorce petition when she said that she will not misbehave in future; (v) moved false and frivolous complaints to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda; (vi) in connivance with her father, broke open the locks of the house and removed the valuables; and (vii) threatened the petitioner to get him physically liquidated. [15]. To prove the above reproduced first allegation, the respondent in addition to his own statement, has examined Om Parkash (AW3). The said witness has deposed that whenever he visited the house of the petitioner and he requested the respondent to prepare tea, she refused for all the times . He, however, has admitted that he did not know as to whether the respondent used to prepare meals for her husband, mother-in-law and children as according to the witness, he did not sit in the house all the times . The statement of this witness inspires no confidence at all. He was a family friend of the respondent. No date, month or year of his alleged visit to the house of the respondent has been disclosed by him. A sweeping statement by an interested witness, which is totally vague in nature, cannot be termed as a reliable evidence. So far as the respondent's own version is concerned, no credence can be given to the same as it would be revealed that he was hellbent on throwing the appellant out of her matrimonial home on one pretext or the other. The second instance of cruelty is sought to be substantiated through Uzagar Singh (AW5) who has deposed that the -: 9 :- appellant used to abuse the respondent. In his cross examination, he had to concede that he did not remember as to when did he visit the residence of the parties. He admits that the appellant visited his residence and complained that her husband is not paying any maintenance nor keeping her with him . If those were the state of affairs that the appellant wife had to rush to one family friend or the other for her sustenance, how could the appellant be held guilty of subjecting the respondent to cruelty? The other witness Amrik Singh (AW6) - a Junior Engineer is also a colleague of the respondent. While he claims that the appellant used to go to the office of the XEN/SDO for making complaints against her husband and used to utter obnoxious remarks against him, he admits having no knowledge as to whether or not the respondent provided food and clothing to his wife and/or paid maintenance. Interestingly, the complaint (Ex.A8) produced by Constable Dalbir Singh is a complaint made by the mother of the respondent against the appellant before the SSP, Bhatinda. How on the earth the said document could be relied upon against the appellant to establish the alleged cruelty by her towards the respondent, is beyond any legal fiction. The learned trial court, however, has taken these self-serving complaints made by the respondent or his mother also as an evidence against the appellant. [16]. This takes us to the third incident, namely, a complaint by the appellant to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda. The appellant has candidly admitted in her written statement as well as in her deposition that she made a complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda. She has, however, given a specific reason, namely, that in the midnight of 2.5.1991 and 4.5.1991 respectively, the respondent sent an unsocial element hired by him to her residence who was caught and thrashed by the neighbours. -: 10 :- Fortunately, the father of the appellant was staying with her during those days. The respondent has not been able to dispute this occurrence specifically. Had she been all alone, any untoward incident could have taken place. In these circumstances when the respondent was adopting all sorts of dubious means to brow-beat and terrorize the appellant so as to force her to vacate the house of his mother, what sin the appellant had committed by approaching the district administration for the protection of her life and liberty? This was a lawful action taken by her, which, with no stretch of imagination, can be termed as an act of cruelty on her part. [17]. Adverting to the allegation that the appellant gave beatings to the mother of the respondent, firstly, no evidence of causing such beatings, like medico-legal report, etc. has been brought on record. No independent person, who might have witnessed such an incident, has come forward to depose. Even the mother of the respondent has not come and deposed. Not only this, the eldest child of the parties was 18 years old when the divorce petition was filed. Even he could have been produced to depose the truth. In the absence of an iota of evidence, no reliance on the bald statement of the respondent, can be placed. There is no other evidence to support the allegation that the respondent was ever subjected to cruelty by the appellant. The conclusion drawn by the learned trial court on issue No.2 is also, thus, contrary to the evidence on record and is, therefore, reversed. [18]. There are, however, more than one reason to hold that the respondent founded his petition upon totally false allegations and it is rather he who has subjected the appellant with extreme cruelty. The evidence on record does suggest that she was physically tortured and has been deprived of basic necessities for survival and to live with dignity. She has lost her -: 11 :- eye sight due to cruel and callous attitude of the respondent who could not muster the strength to deny the said truth though has sought to explain that the appellant was not taken for treatment, as she was suffering from an incurable hereditary disease . It cannot be overlooked that it was a case where the marriage was solemnized long back in the year 1973. No fault was found with the appellant's behaviour when three children were sired and they grew up enough to look after themselves independently. It is thereafter only that the respondent started finding consistent faults with the appellant. From the zimni orders passed by the learned trial court, it is apparent that the respondent has been adopting one or the other unsavory means to delay or deny the payment of maintenance to the appellant. She was forced to visit the offices of higher authorities of the respondent as well as his friends in order to persuade him to pay maintenance to her. The fact that the respondent also got filed an 'eviction petition' through his mother to render the appellant homeless, is yet another strong circumstance to exhibit his vengeance against the appellant. [19]. The appellant's allegation that the respondent himself left the matrimonial home as he did not want to live with her, is further proved by the fact that on 28.8.1993, the divorce petition was put before the Lok Adalat where he compromised the matter and agreed to take the appellant with him. He, however, turned around and later on made a statement that the situation has changed and he is not ready to keep her . It is also on record that even for the recovery of the arrears of maintenance, the appellant was forced to file a civil suit. [20]. For the reasons afore-stated, the impugned judgment dated .6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, being contrary to -: 12 :- the facts and evidence on record, is liable to be set aside. [21]. The matter, however, is not as simple as to be rested here. The parties were married in the year 1973. They have been admittedly living separately since the year 1991. Their children have grown up and are married. In order to find out an amicable solution, their eldest son was also asked to be present in Court. He did come. The parties were heard in person also. The appellant is in a pitiable condition. She has almost turned blind and is now confined to a one room accommodation, which is stated to be in a dilapidated condition. The respondent has refused to carry out the necessary repairs even when the appellant's right to residence is a part and parcel of her right to maintenance. (Ref: B.P. Achala Anand v. S. Appi Reddy, (2005)3 SCC 313) She cannot spare money out of a meagre amount of Rs.600/- which she is getting as maintenance pendente-lite. Though the appellant's suit for recovery was decreed by both the courts below, however, the Regular Second Appeal preferred by the respondent was admitted and operation of those judgments was stayed. She, thus, could not recover even a penny from the respondent. In these peculiar circumstances, the intervention of the parties' son was sought but he too expressed his helplessness in resolving the dispute. As the respondent took a categoric stand not to take the appellant to her matrimonial home in any circumstance, the appellant was persuaded and she reluctantly agreed to part ways on payment of a reasonable and respectable lump-sum amount, a part of which she urgently requires for her eyes' surgery and repair of the one room house. This was also not acceptable to the respondent. [22]. As the parties are living separately from the last 15 years and the bad blood against each other is still boiling hot, it is undoubtedly a case -: 13 :- of irretrievably broken marriage. The parties are at a point of no-return. While the respondent cannot encash his own misdeeds, the appellant also need not be foisted upon him at this stage as he is not ready to accept her for the re-beginning of their married life. The solution to such a dilemma lies in the principles enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohni, 2006(4) SCC 558. Applying the dictum laid therein and keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, as noticed above, I uphold the decree of divorce not on the ground of 'cruelty' or 'desertion' as granted by the learned trial court, rather after holding that it is a case of irrepairable broken marriage. The marriage is totally dead and has ceased to exist. The parties have no sentiments for each other. The decree of divorce, granted by the trial court, therefore, is kept intact subject to, however, the condition that the respondent husband shall pay a total sum of Rs.5 lacs to the appellant within a period of six months, i.e., a sum of Rs.1 lacs shall be paid by him within one month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order and the remaining four lacs in two equal installments of Rs.2 lacs each, the first one to be paid two months after the payment of Rs.1 lac and the balance amount of Rs.2 lacs shall be paid by him in another three months thereafter. [23]. The lump-sum amount has been awarded after taking notice of the fact that the respondent has not only got lacs of rupees towards retiral benefits, he, along with his sons, is also running flourishing business including an industrial unit. He is, thus, financially sound and capable to part with the aforesaid amount. [24]. However, if the respondent fails to pay the afore-stated amount to the appellant within the prescribed time schedule, in that event the appeal -: 14 :- shall stand allowed and as a result thereof the judgment and decree dated .6.1993 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhatinda would be taken to have been set aside with costs of Rs.15,000/-.

Parshotam Dass ...Respondent CORAM:HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SURYA KANT . Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment ? . To be referred to the Reporters or not ? . Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest. Present: Shri S.K. Sud, Advocate for the appellant. Shri Raman Mahajan, Advocate for the respondent. ORDER Surya Kant, J. - This Appeal has been filed by the wife against the judgment dated 3.6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhatinda whereby a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for short the Act) on the ground of cruelty and desertion, preferred by the respondent husband, has been accepted and their marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce. [2]. The marriage between the parties was solemnized on 19.2.1973 at Patiala. At the time when the subject divorce petition was filed by the husband on 21.10.1991, they had three male children born out of the wedlock and they were about 18, 16 and 12 years of age respectively. In his -: 2 :- petition, the respondent alleged that the behaviour of the appellant towards the respondent and his old mother was indifferent from the very beginning; that she is suffering from some sort of mental disorder with the result that she refused to cook meals for him and the minor children; that she levelled false allegations qua the character of the respondent; that she gave severe beatings to the mother of the respondent on 22.9.1990 and that as a result thereof, he filed a divorce petition in which the appellant allegedly made a statement on 13.3.1991 that she will not misbehave in future with the respondent or his mother and undertook not to file any complaints against him either to the police or to the higher authorities of the Board; that the matter was compromised and the petition for dissolution of the marriage was withdrawn. [3]. The respondent has further averred that soon after the above stated compromise, the appellant allegedly refused to honour her words and started making false and frivolous complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda alleging that she had fear for her life at the hands of the respondent. The respondent alleged that he along with the children has been forced to live in the small rented house and that he has a vast circle of friends but the appellant allegedly refused to look after the visitors and forced the respondent to cook meals, clean utensils and wash the clothes of the children also . This fact was allegedly noticed by the relatives and friends of the respondent who used to visit the house thereby causing great mental cruelty to him as the respondent's reputation stood blotted. It was further alleged that the appellant in connivance with her father broke open the locks of the house which is under the possession of his mother and valuable articles were removed.... . It was also alleged that -: 3 :- the appellant threatened the respondent to get him physically liquidated . On the strength of these allegations, the respondent sought dissolution of their marriage by a decree of divorce. [4]. The appellant contested the above stated petition vide her reply dated 16.12.1992 and took a preliminary objection that the respondent in fact was taking advantage of his own wrongs as it was he who subjected her to cruelty even though she wanted to lead a honorable life with him. The appellant specifically averred that the respondent has deserted her with ulterior motive and has declined to give food and shelter . On merits, the appellant took the plea that soon after their marriage, the respondent started harassing her for bringing insufficient dowry and did not even attend the marriage of her brother held in the year 1974. She alleged that till the time her father-in-law was alive, the respondent used to behave reasonably well, however, after his death in the year 1978, he started beating her mercilessly and on many occasions refused to provide food or woolen clothes during winters. It was alleged that for the last over five years, the respondent has been continuously beating her so badly and ruthlessly that it has also affected her eye sight. She denied the allegations that she refused to cook food for the respondent, their children or her mother-in-law or that she ever made any false complaints against the respondent to the authorities. In para of the written statement, the appellant specifically alleged that in fact the respondent desired to re-marry and wanted to get rid of her . She further alleged that the previous divorce petition was withdrawn by the respondent after stating that he had compromised the matter and shall not beat her and will behave properly in future. In fact the divorce petition was withdrawn by him to avoid maintenance pendente-lite and litigation expenses. The -: 4 :- appellant specifically averred that she never refused to accompany the respondent, rather it is he who refused to take the respondent to his home . She further averred that since the respondent wanted to turn her out of the matrimonial home, he himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813 Bhatinda and thereafter got filed eviction application against her from his mother alleging therein that she was a tenant in the house. The appellant admitted that she had to approach the Deputy Commissioner Bhatinda as her life and liberty was at stake for the reason that the respondent sent hired unsocial elements at midnight at her residence on 2nd May, 1991 and 4th May, 1991 who was later on caught by the neighbours and was given severe beatings. Fortunately, her father was with her at that time. [5]. In his rejoinder, the respondent husband not only reiterated the allegations, he further averred that since he refused to pay Rs.25,000/- to the brother of the appellant who wanted to expand his business of welding material, she became totally arrogant and threatened him that she will take revenge later on. Admitting the poor eye sight of the appellant, the respondent averred that she is suffering from an inherited disease.... which cannot be cured.... . He denied the allegations that he wanted to re-marry. [6]. On the basis of the pleadings, following issues were framed by the learned trial court:- 1. Whether respondent has deserted the petitioner without any sufficient and reasonable cause? OPA . Whether the respondent is guilty of cruelty as alleged in the petition? OPA . Whether the respondent is entitled to special costs as -: 5 :- alleged in the written statement? OPR . Whether the petitioner has no cause of action and locus standi to file the petition? . Relief. [7]. In order to discharge his onus qua issues No.1 and 2, the respondent examined formal witnesses Prem Kumar (AW1), who is a record-keeper in the Sessions Division at Bhatinda and produced the file of previous divorce petition HMA No.35 dated 28.9.1990 decided on .3.1991 as well as Surjit Singh (AW2), who being Reader to the Court of Additional District Judge Bhatinda on 13.3.1991, had recorded the statements of the parties. The respondent also examined Om Parkash (AW3), ASI Kashmir Singh (AW4), Uzagar Singh (AW5), Amrik Singh (AW6), Constable Dalbir Singh (AW7), Head Constable Gurcharan Kaur (AW8), respondent, himself as (AW9) and Madan Lal Sharma (AW10) and also relied upon documents Ex.A1 to A8. [8]. The appellant, on the other hand, examined her brother Amar Nath Gupta (RW1) and she herself entered the witness box as (RW2). She also relied upon the documents Ex.R1 to R6. [9]. Upon appreciation of the above stated evidence and while deciding the issues No.1 and 2 together, the learned Additional District Judge held that the appellant refused to prepare tea for the visitors, she often abused her husband and made false complaints against him to the police and his colleagues/superiors. The appellant's statement dated 13.3.1991 (Ex.A1) in the previous divorce petition, which was compromised, has also been relied upon to arrive at the aforesaid conclusion. The learned trial court also placed reliance upon Ex.A4, a report alleged to have been made by HC -: 6 :- Gurcharan Kaur and concluded that, there is no rebuttal to documentary evidence of the petitioner regarding the alleged cruelty by the respondent and that the appellant only wanted to extract money from the petitioner by filing various petitions and applications before the police . The learned trial court held that it was a case of causing 'mental cruelty' to the husband who made every effort to join the respondent in his company . The learned trial court further held that the appellant-wife has deserted the respondent without any sufficient and reasonable cause... . Both the issues were accordingly answered against the appellant, resulting into passing of the impugned judgment and decree. [10]. I have heard Learned Counsel for the parties, perused the pleadings, the impugned judgment as well as the evidence on record. [11]. Before adverting to issue No.2, i.e., whether or not the respondent is guilty of cruelty as alleged in the petition , I firstly propose to deal with issue No.1, as to whether she had deserted the respondent without any sufficient and reasonable cause? . [12]. If one reads the petition under Section 13 of the Act dated .10.1991 , it is evident in unequivocal terms that no allegations, what-so- ever, that the appellant ever deserted her husband without any sufficient cause, have been made. The entire petition is founded upon the allegations of cruelty and it is in that process that the respondent in para 8 of the petition has averred that he along with his sons, who are studying in Convent School and DAV College, Bhatinda respectively, have been forced to live in the small rented house . No averment that the appellant voluntarily left her matrimonial home and, thus, deserted the respondent, has been made. In the absence of such allegations, how issue No.1 was -: 7 :- framed, is beyond comprehension. Be that as it may, it is the admitted fact that house no.3880, Neeta Street, behind Gurdwara Singh Sabha, Bhatinda is owned by the respondent or his mother. The parties were admittedly residing in the said house only, as the respondent himself gave the same address for both the parties in his first divorce petition No. HMA35 dated .9.1990. The parties were, thus, residing under the same roof not only in the year 1990 but also at the time when they compromised their matrimonial dispute on 13.3.1991. In para 6 of her written statement, the appellant wife has specifically averred that the respondent husband himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813 Bhatinda . This fact has been admitted by the respondent in para 8 of the divorce petition though in a different manner. Not only this, the appellant admittedly continues to stay in the same house owned by the respondent or his mother even though the respondent attempted to throw her out by getting an eviction petition filed through his mother. The appellant's specific stand that an eviction petition was filed by her mother-in-law alleging her to be a tenant in the premises, has not been controverted by the respondent in his rejoinder. If that is so, the conclusion drawn by the learned trial court that the appellant has deserted her husband without any sufficient cause is totally contrary to the evidence on record. It is the respondent who concededly left the matrimonial home and shifted to a rented accommodation. The finding returned by the learned trial court on issue No.1, therefore, cannot sustain and is accordingly set aside. [13]. This takes us to the crucial issue as to who out of the two subjected the other to cruelty of such a high degree that the matrimonial tie had to be snapped by a decree of divorce. -: 8 :- [14]. At the cost of repetition, it may be noticed that in order to prove the allegation of cruelty at the hands of the appellant, the respondent has alleged that she (i) refused to cook meals for the family; (ii) levelled false allegations on the character of the respondent; (iii) gave beatings to the mother of the respondent; (iv) admitted these allegations in her statement on .3.1991 in the previous divorce petition when she said that she will not misbehave in future; (v) moved false and frivolous complaints to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda; (vi) in connivance with her father, broke open the locks of the house and removed the valuables; and (vii) threatened the petitioner to get him physically liquidated. [15]. To prove the above reproduced first allegation, the respondent in addition to his own statement, has examined Om Parkash (AW3). The said witness has deposed that whenever he visited the house of the petitioner and he requested the respondent to prepare tea, she refused for all the times . He, however, has admitted that he did not know as to whether the respondent used to prepare meals for her husband, mother-in-law and children as according to the witness, he did not sit in the house all the times . The statement of this witness inspires no confidence at all. He was a family friend of the respondent. No date, month or year of his alleged visit to the house of the respondent has been disclosed by him. A sweeping statement by an interested witness, which is totally vague in nature, cannot be termed as a reliable evidence. So far as the respondent's own version is concerned, no credence can be given to the same as it would be revealed that he was hellbent on throwing the appellant out of her matrimonial home on one pretext or the other. The second instance of cruelty is sought to be substantiated through Uzagar Singh (AW5) who has deposed that the -: 9 :- appellant used to abuse the respondent. In his cross examination, he had to concede that he did not remember as to when did he visit the residence of the parties. He admits that the appellant visited his residence and complained that her husband is not paying any maintenance nor keeping her with him . If those were the state of affairs that the appellant wife had to rush to one family friend or the other for her sustenance, how could the appellant be held guilty of subjecting the respondent to cruelty? The other witness Amrik Singh (AW6) - a Junior Engineer is also a colleague of the respondent. While he claims that the appellant used to go to the office of the XEN/SDO for making complaints against her husband and used to utter obnoxious remarks against him, he admits having no knowledge as to whether or not the respondent provided food and clothing to his wife and/or paid maintenance. Interestingly, the complaint (Ex.A8) produced by Constable Dalbir Singh is a complaint made by the mother of the respondent against the appellant before the SSP, Bhatinda. How on the earth the said document could be relied upon against the appellant to establish the alleged cruelty by her towards the respondent, is beyond any legal fiction. The learned trial court, however, has taken these self-serving complaints made by the respondent or his mother also as an evidence against the appellant. [16]. This takes us to the third incident, namely, a complaint by the appellant to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda. The appellant has candidly admitted in her written statement as well as in her deposition that she made a complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda. She has, however, given a specific reason, namely, that in the midnight of 2.5.1991 and 4.5.1991 respectively, the respondent sent an unsocial element hired by him to her residence who was caught and thrashed by the neighbours. -: 10 :- Fortunately, the father of the appellant was staying with her during those days. The respondent has not been able to dispute this occurrence specifically. Had she been all alone, any untoward incident could have taken place. In these circumstances when the respondent was adopting all sorts of dubious means to brow-beat and terrorize the appellant so as to force her to vacate the house of his mother, what sin the appellant had committed by approaching the district administration for the protection of her life and liberty? This was a lawful action taken by her, which, with no stretch of imagination, can be termed as an act of cruelty on her part. [17]. Adverting to the allegation that the appellant gave beatings to the mother of the respondent, firstly, no evidence of causing such beatings, like medico-legal report, etc. has been brought on record. No independent person, who might have witnessed such an incident, has come forward to depose. Even the mother of the respondent has not come and deposed. Not only this, the eldest child of the parties was 18 years old when the divorce petition was filed. Even he could have been produced to depose the truth. In the absence of an iota of evidence, no reliance on the bald statement of the respondent, can be placed. There is no other evidence to support the allegation that the respondent was ever subjected to cruelty by the appellant. The conclusion drawn by the learned trial court on issue No.2 is also, thus, contrary to the evidence on record and is, therefore, reversed. [18]. There are, however, more than one reason to hold that the respondent founded his petition upon totally false allegations and it is rather he who has subjected the appellant with extreme cruelty. The evidence on record does suggest that she was physically tortured and has been deprived of basic necessities for survival and to live with dignity. She has lost her -: 11 :- eye sight due to cruel and callous attitude of the respondent who could not muster the strength to deny the said truth though has sought to explain that the appellant was not taken for treatment, as she was suffering from an incurable hereditary disease . It cannot be overlooked that it was a case where the marriage was solemnized long back in the year 1973. No fault was found with the appellant's behaviour when three children were sired and they grew up enough to look after themselves independently. It is thereafter only that the respondent started finding consistent faults with the appellant. From the zimni orders passed by the learned trial court, it is apparent that the respondent has been adopting one or the other unsavory means to delay or deny the payment of maintenance to the appellant. She was forced to visit the offices of higher authorities of the respondent as well as his friends in order to persuade him to pay maintenance to her. The fact that the respondent also got filed an 'eviction petition' through his mother to render the appellant homeless, is yet another strong circumstance to exhibit his vengeance against the appellant. [19]. The appellant's allegation that the respondent himself left the matrimonial home as he did not want to live with her, is further proved by the fact that on 28.8.1993, the divorce petition was put before the Lok Adalat where he compromised the matter and agreed to take the appellant with him. He, however, turned around and later on made a statement that the situation has changed and he is not ready to keep her . It is also on record that even for the recovery of the arrears of maintenance, the appellant was forced to file a civil suit. [20]. For the reasons afore-stated, the impugned judgment dated .6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, being contrary to -: 12 :- the facts and evidence on record, is liable to be set aside. [21]. The matter, however, is not as simple as to be rested here. The parties were married in the year 1973. They have been admittedly living separately since the year 1991. Their children have grown up and are married. In order to find out an amicable solution, their eldest son was also asked to be present in Court. He did come. The parties were heard in person also. The appellant is in a pitiable condition. She has almost turned blind and is now confined to a one room accommodation, which is stated to be in a dilapidated condition. The respondent has refused to carry out the necessary repairs even when the appellant's right to residence is a part and parcel of her right to maintenance. (Ref: B.P. Achala Anand v. S. Appi Reddy, (2005)3 SCC 313) She cannot spare money out of a meagre amount of Rs.600/- which she is getting as maintenance pendente-lite. Though the appellant's suit for recovery was decreed by both the courts below, however, the Regular Second Appeal preferred by the respondent was admitted and operation of those judgments was stayed. She, thus, could not recover even a penny from the respondent. In these peculiar circumstances, the intervention of the parties' son was sought but he too expressed his helplessness in resolving the dispute.

This was also not acceptable to the respondent. [22]. As the parties are living separately from the last 15 years and the bad blood against each other is still boiling hot, it is undoubtedly a case -: 13 :- of irretrievably broken marriage. The parties are at a point of no-return. While the respondent cannot encash his own misdeeds, the appellant also need not be foisted upon him at this stage as he is not ready to accept her for the re-beginning of their married life. The solution to such a dilemma lies in the principles enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohni, 2006(4) SCC 558. Applying the dictum laid therein and keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, as noticed above, I uphold the decree of divorce not on the ground of 'cruelty' or 'desertion' as granted by the learned trial court, rather after holding that it is a case of irrepairable broken marriage. The marriage is totally dead and has ceased to exist. The parties have no sentiments for each other. The decree of divorce, granted by the trial court, therefore, is kept intact subject to, however, the condition that the respondent husband shall pay a total sum of Rs.5 lacs to the appellant within a period of six months, i.e., a sum of Rs.1 lacs shall be paid by him within one month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order and the remaining four lacs in two equal installments of Rs.2 lacs each, the first one to be paid two months after the payment of Rs.1 lac and the balance amount of Rs.2 lacs shall be paid by him in another three months thereafter.

(Oral) The appeal is at the instance of the State challenging the award passed by the Additional District Judge, Patiala, against the compensation assessed for acquisition of land for construction of diversion of Railway Crossing for SYL Canal. The notification had been issued on 17.10.1985 under the Land Acquisition Act. The property situate was in Rampur Kaleran, HB No.94, Tehsil Sirhind, District Patiala. The Land Acquisition Collector had assessed the compensation of ` 72,990/- for chahi and nehri lands and in the appeal, the landowners had relied on the award passed by the FAO No.1346 of 1996 (O&M) - 2 - District Judge on 06.09.1990 in Alampur Village. The Government had relied on two transactions of sale Ex.R3 dated 03.03.1983 and R-4 dated 02.06.1983, but the Court chose to rely on the valuation assessed by the District Judge in proceedings relating to compensation in adjoining village. I have not the benefit of information of what the sale deeds recited as consideration, for, I secure no help from either of the parties. I find no error in the approach made by the Additional District Judge by its reference to the award of the District Judge in contemporaneous proceedings relating to determination of compensation in the immediate adjacent village. I maintain the award and dismiss the appeal.\n\n(K.KANNAN) JUDGE .10.2012 sanjeev",

JUSTICE ADARSH KUMAR GOEL HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AJAI LAMBA Present: Mr. VK Sandhir, Advocate, for the petitioners. Mr. Har Simran Singh Sethi, Advocate for Caveators. JUDGMENT: This petition challenges order dated 25.5.2007, Annexure P.1 cancelling order of posting of the petitioners to the Municipal Town Planning Wing as Building Inspectors. Case of the petitioners is that in the Building Department of Municipal Corporation, Amritsar, there are only seven Building Inspectors against twenty vacancies and, therefore, the petitioners were posted against the said vacant posts on 11.4.2007. Respondent Nos. 4 to 9 challenged the posting of the petitioners by filing a writ petition in this Court, which was disposed of vide order dated 23.4.2007 by directing that decision be taken on legal notice of the said respondents. Accordingly, order Annexure P.1 has been passed cancelling order of posting of the petitioners in the Town Planning Wing. A perusal of order Anenxure P.1 shows that the Principal Secretary to the Government of Punjab has taken into account service rules laying down the qualification for Inspectors which the petitioners did not possess. In the report Annexure P.7 submitted by the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, to the Government, it has been stated that the services of the petitioners became surplus after abolition of octroi in which department, the petitioners were working and there was scarcity of staff in the Town Planning department. In the writ petition, finding recorded in the impugned order Anenxure P.1 that the petitioners were not technically qualified under the rules, has not been disputed. Contention raised is that the petitioners were not getting any extra monetary benefit by working in the said department and no loss was caused to the private respondents and that the private respondents did not fulfil the qualifications. The petitioners cannot claim any vested right to be posted on any particular post, particularly in absence of qualification, even if there may be shortage of staff in a particular department. The impugned order cancelling posting of the petitioners in the department of Town Planning cannot be held to be illegal or in violation of any law. No interference is, thus, called for with the impugned order. The writ petition is dismissed. (Adarsh Kumar Goel) Judge July 3, 2007 (Ajai Lamba) 'gs' Judge",

JUSTICE VINOD K. SHARMA Present : Mr. Jasbir Rattan, Advocate for the appellant. Mr. Kanwaljit Singh, Sr. Advocate with Mr. Harmanjit Singh, Advocate for the respondent. **** VINOD K. SHARMA, J. Appellant-husband by way of the present appeal has challenged the judgment and decree passed by the learned Addl. District Judge, Kurukshetra dismissing his petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. Appellant-petitioner filed a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce on the plea that the marriage between the parties was performed on 8.10.1989 according to Hindu rites and ceremonies at Ambala City. After the marriage the parties resided at Pehowa, District Kurukshetra but the marriage was not consummated and, thus, no child was born out of the wedlock. On the first night the respondent wife declared to the petitioner that her marriage with the petitioner was performed against her wishes and on account of threat of her father of committing suicide in case of her refusal to marry the appellant-petitioner. It was also the case set up by the appellant-husband that respondent-wife claimed that she had waited for more than 40 years to marry a boy of her choice but her desire has not been fulfilled and, therefore, she would not permit the petitioner to consumate the marriage. Appellant further claimed that respondent did not resume cohabitation with the appellant-petitioner. The appellant did not disclose this fact to his parents on the next morning and rather tried to persuade the respondent so that she should not create tensions and problem, and should behave liken an Indian lady and to forget her past life. The respondent wife instead of mending herself, became arrogant, harsh and cruel to the petitioner as well as his family members. Thereafter father of the respondent was called and everything was made clear to him but nothing tangible came out. The appellant-petitioner was posted at Dhariwal, as an Inspector in Border Security Force, which was terrorist affected area and, therefore, he was granted one week's leave for the marriage and he on expiry of leave went back to his duty at Dhariwal. It is case of the appellant that the marriage was never consummated. The respondent left the matrimonial home and went to her parents house at Ambala City. It was only on persuasion of father of the petitioner and other relations, who visited the house of respondent at Ambala City, it was decided that the petitioner should keep the respondent at Dhariwal for a week and accordingly in the month of December, 1989 respondent went to Dhariwal where the petitioner was posted. The appellant-petitioner made arrangement for her stay in a house of some one but during her stay at Dhariwal also, the behaviour of the respondent remained the same. It is also allegation of the appellant-petitioner that he invited some officers of the B.S.F. to celebrate but respondent refused to attend the celebration which was a very humiliating for the appellant. It is also the allegation that when appellant invited some of his colleagues the respondent refused to join them and slept in a room complaining of headache and this cruel act of the respondent forced the petitioner to spend sleepless nights. Even during her stay at Dhariwal she did not permit the appellant-petitioner to consummate the marriage as respondent gave threat that she would commit suicide if she was forced to live with him. Only after a week respondent forced him to drop her at Ambala City. The appellant claimed that on persuasion of his parents he took one month's leave for the period 20.12.1989 to 20.1.1990 when father of the respondent brought her to Pehowa and advised the respondent to live like a pious lady but all in vain. On the first night during their stay at Pehowa during the vacations, the respondent wife wiped out her 'Sindoor' and 'Bindi' affixed on her forehead and broke all the bangles with a threat that ties of the marriage with the appellant-petitioner had been broken. The respondent did not allow the petitioner to touch her body with the same threat of committing suicide. In view of the allegations made above, it was pleaded that the life of the appellant was turned into hell. The respondent stayed at Pehowa only for ten days during the leave of one month. He again reported for his duty on 20.1.1990. The respondent-thereafter was again brought to Pehowa after a great persuasion by the father of the petitioner with the help of a Panchayat consisting of Durga Dass, Pawan Kumar and Surender Pal but the respondent again left the matrimonial home in the month of March, 1990 without permission of the father of the petitioner and she further made clear to the father of the petitioner that she should make arrangement for second marriage of the petitioner as she would not return to the matrimonial home. Thus, it was claimed that respondent deserted the appellant-petitioner since March, 1990 without any reasonable cause. Thus, divorce was sought on the ground of cruelty and desertion. The petition was contested by the respondent-wife. In the written statement it was contended that appellant had no locus standi to maintain the petition. Further he was estopped from filing the present petition by his own act and conduct. It was also pleaded that appellant had concealed the true and material facts from the Court. The respondent claimed that the marriage between the parties was arranged through matrimonial column in the newspaper after due verifications and satisfaction regarding the background and status of both the families. The marriage was performed in a traditional form with great pomp and show and sufficient dowry was given by the father of the respondent. It was asserted that the marriage between the parties was consummated and the parties cohabited on the first night. The respondent on the next day of the marriage felt that parents of the petitioner were not happy with the dowry given by the parents of the respondent and their behaviour was not good towards the respondent because they started taunting the respondent. After the marriage the appellant-petitioner stayed at Pehowa where they enjoyed all types of family life including physical relation between the two. It was further the case of the respondent that after the petitioner left Pehowa for his place of posting at Dhariwal, behaviour of the family of the petitioner was totally changed and they started misbehaving and insulting her and further declared that they have got no sufficient accommodation to keep the respondent at Pehowa and, therefore, they asked the respondent to bring a sum of Rs. 50,000/- so as to enable them to raise further construction. The respondent pleaded her helplessness which made behaviour of the parents of the appellant-petitioner to the respondent more rude. Brother of the respondent visited Pehowa to see her on 22.11.1989 and it was the parents of the appellant who sent the respondent with her brother and told her that she should not come back at her own and that when the petitioner would come, he will bring her to the matrimonial home. In December, 1989 respondent went to Dhariwal i.e. the place of posting of appellant and stayed with him for ten days. During her stay at Dhariwal appellant assured her that he will try for a family station and would keep the respondent there and asked the respondent to wait for some time more. She was left at Pehowa but the parents of the petitioner turned her out from matrimonial home in March, 1990 in three clothes. The respondent claimed that she was ready and willing to go with the appellant and it was the appellant who deserted her on the ground that he was posted in sensitive area and a non-family station. He also gave false assertion that respondent would be kept with him whenever he would be posted at a family station. On merit, it was pleaded that the appellant and respondent lived peaceful and happy life at Dhariwal and that the marriage has been consummated on the first night and further that both the husband and wife had physical relation on different occasion. Thus, it was prayed that the petition be dismissed. In replication, the pleas raised in petition were reiterated and that of written statement were denied. On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- . Whether the respondent, after solemnisation of marriage between the parties, treated the petitioner with cruelty. If so its effect ? OPP . Whether the respondent has deserted the petitioner since March, 1990, as alleged. If so its effect ? OPP . Whether the petitioner has no locus- standi to file the claim-petition ? OPR . Whether this Court has got no jurisdiction to maintain and try the petition ?OPR . Whether the petitioner is estopped from filing the petition by his own act and conduct ?OPR . Relief. Issues No. 1 & 2 were taken up together. In support of the plea the appellant appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and deposed that he was married with respondent on 8.10.1989 and that after the marriage the respondent was brought at Pehowa. On the first night, the respondent told him that she wanted to marry some other boy of her choice but her father forced her to marry to him. It was asserted that the marriage was not consummated. It was claimed that matter was told to his father 2-3 after the marriage when they went to the father of the respondent, who came to Pehowa and advised the respondent to cooperate with the appellant- petitioner. However, in spite of advice of her father there was no change in her behaviour. He also stated that he went to Dhariwal, his place of posting, after 2-3 days of marriage, where he remained under tension. In the second week of December, 1989 father of respondent dropped her at Dhariwal and thereafter the respondent stayed for 6-7 days in a quarter of his friend situated in the office of the Company. During her stay with him at Dhariwal, she did not attend to his friends and officers whom he invited for dinner. Similarly, she did not attend and join his other colleagues who visited the quarter. Thus, behaviour of respondent resulted in tension. The marriage was also not consummated at Dhariwal in view of the threat of suicide. The respondent was left at Pehowa, from where she went to her parents house at Ambala City. On 20.12.1989 he came to Pehowa on one month's leave and the respondent also came there and stayed there for three days. During the vacations of one month, respondent usually came to Pehowa and went back to Ambala. It was also stated that on the first visit to Pehowa during his vacations, the respondent wiped out the 'Sindur' and broke bangles and threatened to commit suicide if he touched her. Even during her stay at Pehowa the marriage was not consummated. It was also stated that the wife used to quarrel with the appellant and his family members, which resulted in great mental and physical torture. The other averments in petition were also reiterated. The appellant-petitioner further examined his father Tej Nath as PW-2, who deposed that after the celebration of the marriage between the parties, the respondent came to Pehowa and 2-3 days thereafter the appellant told him that the respondent had told to the petitioner that the marriage of respondent was performed against her wishes and that the respondent had threatened to commit suicide if he would touch her body. He stated that he went to father of the respondent and told about the incident on which father of the respondent accompanied him to Pehowa and made respondent understand the things. He also stated about the appellant-petitioner went back to place of his posting after six days as he had come on leave for ten days for the performance of marriage. He also deposed with respect to the attitude of the respondent during her stay with them. He also supported the appellant that the respondent wife stayed at Dhariwal for 6-7 days but she was brought back to Pehowa and during her stay at Dhariwal she had repeated the threat of suicide. The appellant went back to Dhariwal whereas the respondent-wife left for her parental house at Ambala. He also supported the version of the appellant with regard to the conduct of the respondent during one month's leave of the appellant. PW-3 Surender Sharma, brother-in-law of the appellant, deposed that on 3rd March, 1990, he accompanied by his father-in-law Tej Nath and Pawan Kumar visited the house of respondent at Ambala and discussed the matter with the father of the respondent. It was after persuasion that she was sent to Pehowa but she stayed there for only a period of one week and went back to her parents house. On the other hand, the respondent wife appeared as RW-1 and deposed that after the marriage on 8.10.1999 she went to matrimonial home on 9.10.1989 and thereafter she lived with the petitioner as his wife and they cohabited as husband and wife. Even on 10.10.1989 they cohabited and it was on 11.10.1989 she along with the petitioner and two brothers-in-law of the appellant went to her parents house to perform Phera ceremony but returned to Pehowa on the same day after taking meals and thereafter they cohabited as husband and wife and their relations remained cordial. She asserted her allegation of demand of Rs. 50,000/- by the parents of the appellant for the purpose to construct a room. It was claimed that during her stay at Pehowa the parties remained happy and her father and sister also came at Pehowa on festivals like Diwali and Karva-chauth etc. She claimed to have stayed at Pehowa when her husband was away to duty at Dhariwal. On 22.11.1989 the brother of the respondent came to Pehowa to take her as her sister had delivered a son and on that occasion, she was told by her mother-in-law that since there was shortage of accommodation with them, therefore, she should continue to stay at her parents house until her husband comes from the place of his posting. On 10.11.1987 Chander Shekhar, brother-in-law of the petitioner came to Ambala and told that she had been called by the petitioner at Dhariwal. On this she was first taken to Pehowa as her clothes etc. were at Pehowa and then she was taken at Dhariwal on .11.1989. She stayed at Dhariwal for ten days where she claimed that during her stay they lived peacefully and happily. She claimed that the appellant came to Pehowa along with her on one month's leave and then the appellant went to Tripura on training but she remained at Pehowa upto March, 1990. During her stay at Pehowa she wrote letters Ex. R-1to Ex. R-3 to her parents. She further stated that on the suggestion of her father-in-law she wrote a letter to her parents for sending her certificates as her father-in- law had told that he would make efforts for her job. On 15.3.1990, she wrote a letter Ex. R-2 at the instance of her father-in-law and mother-in-law as they wanted to go out of station and she was asked to go to her parents house with some one. Her sister came to Pehowa on 17.3.1990 and she accompanied her to Ambala. It was on that occasion that she was informed by her in-laws that she could be called back when her husband would come to Pehowa. However, thereafter nobody has come to take her to matrimonial home. It is further stated in evidence that her father-in-law had met her sister at her office at Ambala and on that occasion her sister had asked him as to when she would be taken to her matrimonial home but she was informed that the appellant was posted at non-family station and whenever he would come he would take the respondent. However, nobody turned to take her nor any message was received. The respondent stated that she was still ready to go to the matrimonial home and live with the appellant. Sukh Versha RW-2, sister of respondent appeared in the witness box and stated that she was posted in the office of Home Guards, Haryana. She stated that she visited Pehowa at the matrimonial home of the respondent on so many occasions and even on the occasion of Phera ceremony. The respondent told her that she was happy at the matrimonial home and that the petitioner was also happy at that time. She only blamed about the behaviour of the mother of the petitioner. On Karva-Chauth, the mother-in-law of respondent did not come to see her. She further stated that when she visited Pehowa she found appellant to be in happy mood and she was even served tea. No complaint was made to her about the behaviour of the respondent. She has stated having gone to Pehowa on receipt of letter Ex.R-2 to bring respondent at Ambala as the parents of the appellant were to go out of station for 3-4 days. However, thereafter nobody turned up to take her back to the matrimonial home. RW-3 Fakir Chand, father of the respondent, appeared in the witness box and supported the version of the respondent on material particulars. RW-4 G.P.S. Grewal deposed that in the year 1991 the parents of the parties had come together to his office at Ambala to know about the place of posting of the appellant and also to make a request that she be taken to matrimonial home. However, the father of the appellant refused to take her and even did not tell the particulars of the posting of the appellant. RW-5 Anju Sudan, another sister of the respondent appeared in the witness box to depose that the parties were happy in the matrimonial life. She further claimed that the respondent had told about the consummation of marriage. RW-6 Ramesh Kumar appeared in the witness box and deposed that he had gone to the house of the father of the appellant at Pehowa to give message about the death of uncle of the respondent. The learned matrimonial Court on appreciation of evidence did not accept the version given by the appellant that the respondent has not allowed the consummation of marriage. The Court observed that in case the stand of the appellant was correct there was no occasion for the respondent to have gone to Dhariwal merely after two months of marriage. The Court also did not belive that though the parties stayed together in one room at Chariwal, the marriage was not consummated as untoward incident may not happen. The learned matrimonial Court also observed that threat of suicide seems to be creation of appellant. The evidence, thus, was not believed. The learned Court further observed that the parties lived in Chobara of Vinod Kumar Gupta, friend of the appellant, which is surrounded by other houses. The Court observed that neither Vinod Kumar Gupta nor any other person from the locality was produced to show that the relationship between the parties at Dhariwal were cordial or strained. The learned Matrimonial Court did not believe the allegations that the respondent did not attend to his friends for want of corroboration from any other independent evidence. The Court observed that the appellant failed to examine any of his colleagues. The learned Court held that the material witnesses have been withheld by the appellant. The Court also held that as his statement suffered from inherent defect the same could not be believed to come to a conclusion that the respondent treated her with cruelty. The other part of the story of the respondent had claimed on the first night that she wanted to marry to another boy, was also disbelieved. The Court believed the evidence led by the respondent-wife. The Court did not believe the version of the father of the appellant as he had denied the factum of marriage having been performed through advertisement. The Court also observed that the evidence brought on record showed that the respondent and her father made efforts for rehabilitation of the parties. She was further said to have given detailed version that the parties cohabited at Pehowa and then at Dhariwal and also that they lived very happily. The learned Court also discussed the documentary evidence brought on record and, thus, held that the appellant has failed to prove that respondent had treated him with cruelty or that the appellant had deserted the matrimonial home. The issues framed were decided against the appellant and the petition was dismissed. Mr. Jasbir Rattan, learned counsel for the appellant referred to the statement of PW-1 i.e. the appellant to contend that the evidence on record showed that the respondent had not allowed the appellant to consumate the marriage and this fact stood further proved from the statement of PW-2, his father and, therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant was that this act of the respondent amounted to cruelty. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that cruelty can be both physical and mental. The learned counsel for the appellant also referred to the statement of PW-2 to contend that the real dispute between the parties was regarding age of Neelam which was wrongly shown less for the matrimonial alliance though she was older than the appellant. He further referred to the statement of other witnesses i.e. PW-3 and PW-4 and contended that the allegations made in the petition stood proved and, therefore, the finding of the learned matrimonial Court deserves to be set aside. He further referred to the statement of RW-1to contend that if the evidence is read in totality it would show that the respondent was not happy with the status of the family of appellant and complained about the shortage of accommodation. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant, therefore, was that if the evidence brought on record is seen in totality it would show that the appellant was treated with cruelty. The learned counsel for the appellant referred to the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh (2) Civil Court cases 663 (S.C.) to contend that no uniform standard can ever be laid down which may prove mental cruelty. It is the totality of the circumstances and evidence brought on record that a view can be formed whether the person is treated with mental cruelty or not. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh (supra) has been pleased to lay down as under :- 85. No uniform standard can even be laid down for guidance, yet we deem it appropriate to enumerate some instances of human behaviour which may be relevant in dealing with the case of 'mental cruelty'. The instances indicated in the succeeding paragraphs are only illustrative and not exhaustive. (i) On consideration of complete matrimonial life of the parties, acute mental pain, agony and suffering as would not make possible for the parties to live with each other could come with the broad parameters of mental cruelty. (ii) On comprehensive appraisal of the entire matrimonial life of the parties, it becomes abundantly clear that situation is such that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and continue to live with other party. (iii) Mere coldness or lack of affection cannot amount to cruelty, frequent rudeness of language, petulance of matter, indifference and neglect may reach such a decree that it makes the material life for the other spouse absolutely intolerable. (iv) Mental cruelty is a state of mind. The feeling of deep anguish, disappointment, frustration in one spouse caused by the conduct of other for a long time may lead to mental cruelty. (v) A sustained course of abusive and humiliating treatment calculated to torture, discommode or render miserable life of the spouse. (vi) Sustained unjustifiable conduct and behaviour of one spouse actually affecting physical and mental health of the other spouse. The treatment complained of and the resultant danger or apprehension must be very grave, substantial and weighty. (vii) Sustained reprehensible conduct, studied neglect, indifference or total departure from the normal standard of conjugal kindness causing injury to mental health or deriving sadistic pleasure can also amount to mental cruelty. (viii) The conduct must be much more than jealousy, selfishness, possessiveness, which causes unhappiness and dissatisfaction and emotional upset may not be a ground for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty. (ix) Mere trivial irritations, quarrels, normal wear and tear of the married life which happens in day to day life would not be adequate for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty. (x) The married life should be reviewed as a whole and a few isolated instances over a period of years will not amount to cruelty. The ill- conduct must be persistent for a fairly lengthy period, where the relationship has deteriorated to an extent that because of the acts and behaviour of a spouse, the wronged party finds it extremely difficult to live with the other party any longer, may amount to mental cruelty. (xi) If a husband submits himself for an operation of sterilization without medical reasons and without the consent or knowledge of his wife and similarly if the wife undergoes vasectomy or abortion without medical reason or without the consent or knowledge of her husband, such an act of the spouse may lead to mental cruelty. (xii) Unilateral decision of refusal to have intercourse for considerable period without there being any physical incapacity or valid reason may amount to mental cruelty. (xiii) Unilateral decision of either husband or wife after marriage not to have child from the marriage may amount to cruelty. (xiv) Where there has been a long period of continuous separation, it may fairly be concluded that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair. The marriage becomes a fiction though supported by a legal tie. By refusing to sever that tie, the law in such cases, does not serve the sanctity of marriage; on the contrary, it shows scant regard for the feelings and emotions of the parties. In such like situations, it may lead to mental cruelty. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant, therefore, was that admittedly there has been long period of continuous separation and, therefore, it could be presumed that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair. The marriage, therefore, is merely fiction though supported by a legal tie and refusal to grant divorce does serve the sanctity of marriage but on the contrary leads to mental cruelty. The learned counsel for the appellant thereafter placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satish Sitole Vs. Ganga AIR 2008 SC 3093 to contend that even if the husband has been unable to make out a ground for divorce but the facts show that the parties have been living separately for long period by making acrimonious allegations against each other then continuance of such marriage would itself amount to cruelty. In such situation the party would be entitle to divorce with adequate provision of alimony. The reliance was placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Naveen Kohli Vs. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) Civil Court cases 226 (S.C.) to contend that irretrievable breakdown of marriage has been recommended to be a ground for divorce. He also contends that it is not only the physical violence but conduct of spouse can also cause mental cruelty and torture. Mr. Kanwaljit Singh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent supported the judgment and decree passed by the learned matrimonial Court primarily on the ground that the appellant cannot be allowed to take benefit of his own wrong. The contention of the learned senior counsel for the respondent was that the respondent has always been willing to accompany the appellant. He further referred to the documentary evidence placed on record by way of letters to contend that the respondent has been happily living in matrimonial home and it was the appellant and his family members who did not want to keep her in matrimonial home. It is the contention that she has even not taken her dowry articles and Istri Dhan, which is still with the appellant. The learned counsel for the respondent contended that the allegations levelled about the non-consummation of marriage are false and have been specifically denied by the respondent and there is no reason, whatsoever, to disbelieve her statement. It is also the contention of the learned senior counsel for the respondent that finding of fact has been recorded by the learned matrimonial Court on appreciation of evidence. The learned counsel for the respondent further contended that the ground of act of cruelty are to be distinguished from ordinary wear and tear of family. The contention of the learned counsel for the respondent is that even if the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant believed to be true, cannot be said to be an act of cruelty. In support of his contention reliance was placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Savitri Pandey Vs. Prem Chandra Pandey AIR 2002 Supreme Court 591. The learned senior counsel for the respondent also referred to the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of Narinder Singh Vs. Rekha @ Pushpa 2007(5) RCR (Civil) 727 to contend that wife refusing to serve tea to friends of her husband and family members, is no ground to seek divorce on the ground of cruelty. The learned senior counsel for the respondent finally referred to the judgment of this Court in the case of Gurdeep Singh alias Tota Singh Vs. Jaspal Kaur 2009(1)RCR (Civil) 593 to contend that irretrievable marriage is not a ground for grant of divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. On consideration of the matter, I find no force in the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellant. The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satish Sitole Vs. Ganga (supra) is in exercise of Article 142 of the Constitution of India on the facts and circumstances of that particular case, therefore, it cannot be binding precedent to decide matrimonial cases. The appellant in view of the findings recorded by the learned matrimonial Court as also evidence brought on record has failed to prove cruelty or desertion. He cannot be allowed to take benefit of his own wrong in not settling respondent in matrimonial home. To claim divorce merely on the ground that the parties have been separately living for number of years cannot be a ground for divorce. The findings of the learned matrimonial Court do not call for any interference by this Court in this appeal. Dismissed with no order as to costs. February 24, 2009\n\n( VINOD K. SHARMA ) 'sp' JUDGE",

It was claimed that matter was told to his father 2-3 after the marriage when they went to the father of the respondent, who came to Pehowa and advised the respondent to cooperate with the appellant- petitioner. The appellant-petitioner further examined his father Tej Nath as PW-2, who deposed that after the celebration of the marriage between the parties, the respondent came to Pehowa and 2-3 days thereafter the appellant told him that the respondent had told to the petitioner that the marriage of respondent was performed against her wishes and that the respondent had threatened to commit suicide if he would touch her body. the appellant to contend that the evidence on record showed that the respondent had not allowed the appellant to consumate the marriage and this fact stood further proved from the statement of PW-2, his father and, therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant was that this act of the respondent amounted to cruelty."

CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K.KANNAN . Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment? . To be referred to the Reporters or not? . Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? ***** K.KANNAN, J. (ORAL) . The petitioner seeks for allotment of a plot in his capacity as a locally displaced person, he having suffered loss of property by acquisition -2- under Punjab Town Improvement Act of 1922. The claim of the petitioner is that as a displaced person, he was entitled to be offered an alternative plot of a similar size. The property which he had lost in acquisition was 300 sq. yds and he had applied for an allotment to the Chairman of the Improvement Trust in the year 1987 and he had also made a payment of Rs.500/- as earnest money on 25.8.1987. The grievance of the petitioner is that although his brother and sister, who had similarly lost property, had been favoured with allotment of plots, the same had been denied to him. . The writ petition, therefore, came to be filed seeking for a issuance of writ of mandamus for allotment of a plot which had been originally allotted to him by the Chairman, Improvement Trust, Ludhiana with the boundaries mentioned in the proceedings. . The objection on behalf of the Improvement Trust was that the notification for acquisition had been made on 8.7.1973 under Section 36 of the Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922 and the acquisition was made on .5.1975 as per Section 42 and award has been passed on 1.8.1975. It is a submission on behalf of the respondent that the petitioner had not made any application for allotment all the years till the year 1987 but the Chairman of the Improvement Trust had no authority to make allotment without confirmation by the Trust. The further objection was that the Chairman had no power to allot a commercial plot and the Rules that were applicable, when he moved an application in the year 1987, was only the Punjab Town Improvement (Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots ) Rules 1983. The Rules, apart from setting out the definition of locally displaced person set out how the allotment in respect of the displaced persons having a joint katha, being co-sharers, could be allotted only for one plot taking into account the whole of joint land acquired and further that the allotment could be made under Rule 11, only to persons who had applied for allotment within a period of three months from the date of the commencement of the -3- Rules. Such allotment would again be available only to persons, who owned more than half an acre of property, which was lost in the acquisition. . The first point for consideration would be the relevant rule that would be applicable. It could be noticed that there were at different times, three types of Rules, one Ludhiana Improvement Trust Land Disposal Rules, 1964; subsequently, Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots by Improvement Trust Rules, 1975 till it was replaced by Punjab Town Improvement (Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots ) Rules, 1983. The applicability of the relevant rule has been dealt with in several decisions of this Hon'ble Court and particularly the matter was considered in Smt.Sushma Palta and others Vs. State of Punjab and others reported in 2006 (4) RCR (Civil) 223, where a Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court was considering the applicability of the Rule, in relation to the definition of a locally displaced person. Adverting to a situation that the acquisition had taken place prior to 1975, the Division Bench held that the definition that would govern, cannot be the 1975 Rules but only the Rules of the year 1951 would be applicable. This issue came up again in yet another case which was disposed in second appeal in Kulwinder Singh Vs. Improvement Trust, Ludhiana, in SA No.2699 of 1997, where the Court held that an advertisement which has been issued in the year 1974 before the actual acqusition would not be sufficient compliance of the Rules of the year 1964, since the publication was to be effected in a particular manner after the acquisition is made and therefore, any advertisement issued even prior to the date of acquisition cannot fetter the right of the individual to apply for an allotment without reference to the date stipulated in the 1974 advertisement. Judgment of this Court was also confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Improvement Trust, Ludhiana Vs. Kulwinder Singh in Civil Appeal No.1487 of 2003. Gurdev Kaur Vs. State of Punjab and another in CWP No.17248 of 1999, again addressed the issue of allotment of a plot under -4- Ludhiana Improvement Trust Land Disposal Rules 1964, when the Court by application of the 1964 Rules directed the competent authority to pass an order of allotment of a suitable residential plot in a scheme area. The decision in Gurmukh Singh Vs. State of Punjab and others in CWP No.4242 of 1985, which the learned counsel for the respondent was fair to cite is the last judgment in the string of decision that considers the relevant rules that would be applicable and the manner of fixation of price. Referring to an acquisition of property and allotment of land to a locally displaced person prior to 1975, the learned single Judge held that the 1964 Rules would govern the right of the parties and the property could be allotted to him, if he is found eligible for such allotment at a rate at which the trust had lastly sold any residential plot in the development scheme. The entitlement under the 1964 Rules are set out through Section 2(b). . In this case, the allotment by the Chairman of the Board is attacked on the ground that the property was not even specifically described with reference to the khalta number or specific extent. It merely had set out the property by boundaries and the Chairman himself had issued several allotment letters by the same boundaries to other persons also and therefore, the offer which had been made was vague and hence not capable of enforcement . . The entitlement for allotment of a plot, in my view, cannot be denied and the petitioner shall be allotted a plot. Even the contention that the plot that was offered by the Chairman of the Board was vague, is contested by the counsel for the petitioner by saying that the property is specifically described with boundaries and there is no difficulty about identifying the same. Learned counsel for the respondent, however, contends that within the boundaries mentioned, there is larger extent of property more than 2000 sq. yds, which the petitioner is not entitled to. He contends that the Improvement Trust has passed a Resolution on 6.2.2001 -5- proposing to raise a monument in the memory of martyrs of Kargil at the property, which the petitioner claims having been allotted to him. The construction of the memorial was stayed by an order of this Court in this writ petition, when the place was sought to be demarcated by erection of steel grill fencing. . The exact location of the property and the extent of property, originally allotted to the petitioner as wholly falling within the boundaries, is a subject of dispute between the parties, which this court in its exercise of jurisdictional power under Article 226 of Constitution cannot unravel without any further evidence. If the property, which is available there within the boundaries is only limited to the extent of 300 sq. yds, even a subsequent Resolution setting it apart for constructing a monument, shall not be put out against the petitioner. It shall be duty of the respondent to look for some other property for such use. If, on the other hand, the extent of property is larger, and the petitioner shall not be entitled to allotment of such a large plot, then the respondent would be entitled to put it to use for which a Resolution has been passed and they shall be at liberty to allot to the petitioner any other alternative plot, which is available under the Scheme. . The writ petition is allowed in the above terms. The compliance of order shall be made within a period of three months. CR No.2515 of 1989 (O&M) There is no representation for the petitioner. The order of impleadment already made by the court below, is confirmed in the light of entitlement as formed in the order in the writ petition. The Civil Revision is therefore dismissed.

    "court": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH Date of decision: 11th December, 2008 Zile Singh (dead, through LRs) Petitioner Versus State of Haryana and others Respondents CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Ms. Munisha Gandhi, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. Jayender Singh Chandail, Addl. AG Haryana for respondent No1. Mr. H.S. Gill, Senior Advocate with Mr. Ramesh Dhiman, Advocate for respondents No.2 to 4. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. (ORAL) Present writ petition was filed by Zile Singh on 2nd November, . During the pendency of proceedings, he died on 16th March, 1996 and is now being represented by his legal representatives. Present petition has been filed seeking a writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing of Annexure P-10 and P-12 passed by respondent No.2 and 3. Vide Annexure P-10, an order was passed by the Managing Director, Haryana State Cooperative Supply & Marketing Federation Limited, that petitioner has embezzled 55 bags of wheat amounting to Rs.7425/- out of wheat stocks lying at Hodal Mandi and he failed to lift 29 bags of wheat of Hassanpur Centre lying with M/s Jai Kishan Trading Co., Hassanpur and had thus caused loss of Rs.3915/-. The Managing Director held that he has no reason as to why punishment proposed in the show cause notice should not be made final. In the show cause notice given to the petitioner, dismissal from the service was proposed. Vide Annexure P-12, an appeal preferred by the petitioner was dismissed by the Administrative Committee of the respondent Haryana State Cooperative Supply & Marketing Federation Limited (hereinafter referred to as, HAFED ). Briefly stated, case of the petitioner is that he joined HAFED as a Clerk on 1st November, 1960. He was promoted as Assistant in the year 1969. Due to good service record, he was promoted to the post of Manager Grade-B in the year 1976. It has been averred that during the entire service record, no adverse remark was reported against the petitioner. In May 1980, petitioner was transferred to Hassanpur Procurement Centre as Manager, In-charge of Wheat Procurement Centre, Hassanpur. In July, 1980 he was transferred from Hassanpur Procurement Centre to Hodel Procurement Centre. On 20th November, 1980, a chargesheet was served upon the petitioner, in which two charges were set out. The chargesheet has been attached as Annexure P-1, and the same reads as under: 1. That he has sold 55 bags of wheat valuing Rs.7425/- out of Hafed wheat stock of 131 bags lying in the Hodal Mandi. This stock was required to be lifted by him and stored in the Hafed godown. Instead of doing this lawful duty he sold bags out of this stock and embezzled its sale proceeds for his personal ends. Similarly, Shri Zile Singh has failed to arrange the lying of 29 bags of wheat of Hafed from Hassanpur Centre lying with M/s Jai Kishan Trading Co. Hassanpur. This stock is now not available with the said firm which emplies a direct loss to Hafed to the extent of Rs.3915/-. As such he is responsible for causing this loss to Hafed alongwith Shri S.S. Nagpal, Accountant-cum-Store Keeper. Reply was filed by the petitioner, in which he stated that when he joined at Hodel, 55 bags were pending with M/s Rawat Shop Hodal and this fact can be verified from the record. It was further stated Rail Head Agency (RHA) of the firm retained Rs.400/- and therefore, there was a conflict between the RHA and the firm. Subsequently, District Manager had resolved the dispute. It was decided that 44 bags would be given by the Mandi Firm and balance would be recovered from the Storekeeper S.S. Nagpal. Therefore, it was stated that petitioner had nothing to do with the embezzlement. Regarding second charge, it was stated that no bags of HAFED are lying at Hassanpur Mandi. The Inquiry Officer found the submissions made by the petitioner before the Inquiry Officer, to be unsatisfactory and held him guilty on both counts. Therefore, the show cause notice (Annexure P-4) was served, as to why he be not dismissed from service. Reply to the show cause notice was filed. The same has been annexed as Annexure P-5. Reply was also rejected and vide Annexure P-10, services of the petitioner were dismissed. Aggrieved against the same, petitioner had filed an appeal (Annexure P-11) and as stated earlier, vide Annexure P-12, appeal was dismissed. Dismissal order, in the present case, was passed on 26th April, and the appeal was dismissed on 6th March, 1987. Simultaneously, the employer respondent HAFED had initiated recovery proceedings against the petitioner for an amount of Rs.22,220/-, for embezzlement of bags of wheat, which was lying at Hodal Mandi and 29 bags of wheat of Hassanpur Centre, which were lying with M/s Jai Kishan Trading Co., Hassanpur. In the recovery proceedings so initiated by the employer, Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Palwal, District Faridabad, vide a well reasoned order (Annexure P-14), held as under: Hafed has only produced copy of P.V. report dated .6.80. Stock register and no other concrete evidence was produced. The evidence produced by Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A. Hodel which were Ann. 1 to 5 which were attached in this file at to 40 which are concrete evidence. And Zile Singh has given in writing that payment of the Transporter be made only after deducting the price of 40 bags. Shri Zile Singh has given the evidence of 30 bags which were left with the Transporter. But according to stock position, statement 20.5.81, against him 38-10 bags were remained. This statement was prepared by the District Manager, Hafed. Therefore, P.V. has no value. About 10 bags Shri Zile Singh has written in his letter that in one truck which was loaded in excess of which payment was taken after unloading the same by the Truck driver of the Transporter with some shopkeeper at Delhi and Shri Zile Singh has written in his statement that Transporter has deposited the price of 8 bags in Hafed R.H.A. Hodel. This statement was also heard and read by Shri Deepak Kumar, District Accountant, But he had not raised any objection to it. Even then if payment of 8 bags were not taken from the transporter then Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A. Hodel may be held liable. The price of the rest of the 30 bags must be deducted from the payment of the transporter at the time of payment. Payment of this was made by the then D.M. Hafed, Faridabad and at the time of payment to the Transporter, that amount was not deducted. Therefore, for this amount the D.M. Hafed Faridabad of that time is responsible. Therefore, case be prepared against him. Today dated 4.2.86, the order is announced in the open Court in the presence of Shri Nav Rattan Singh, District Manager, Hafed, Faridabad, Shri Deepak Kumar, District Accountant, Hafed, Faridabad and Shri Rajbir Singh, D.O. (M.S.) Hafed Faridabad (Petitioner) and Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A. Hodel (Defendant). Ms. Munisha Gandhi appearing for the petitioner has raised two fold submissions before this Court. Firstly, it has been stated that in the recovery proceedings, the plea raised by the petitioner has been accepted. Same plea was raised by the petitioner before the Inquiry Officer and therefore, in parallel proceedings, two contrary findings have been arrived at. It has been further submitted that order passed by the Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, who is an independent quasi-judicial authority, has absolved the petitioner of the charges and the order passed by Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Palwal should be taken into consideration by the Department, as the petitioner has proved his innocence. It has been further stated that appeal of the petitioner has been dismissed vide Annexure P-12 and the order of the appellate authority does not reflect any application of mind. It only states that after discussion, the Committee felt that there was no force in the appeal of Zile Singh, and rejected his appeal. It has been further stated that the coram of order (Annexure P-12) will show that the Managing Director, HAFED was present. It has been stated that the impugned order was passed by the Managing Director, HAFED, therefore, he could not participate in the Administrative Committee, as he could not be a Judge of his own cause. Therefore, order (Annexure P-12) is vitiated. Mr. H.S. Gill, Senior Advocate assisted by Mr. Ramesh Dhiman, states that the Managing Director, HAFED, present was not the same person. I am of the view that this contention cannot be accepted. Therefore, the order of the appellate authority is set aside. The order was passed by the Managing Director in his official capacity and the Managing Director is bound to defend the order before the Administrative Committee, therefore, the order (Annexure P-12) is liable to be set aside. Taking into consideration the fact that during pendency of the appeal, order Annexure P-14 has been passed in favour of the petitioner, legal representatives of the petitioner are permitted to file fresh grounds of appeal and may also place on record Annexure P-16 and P-17 before the Appellate Authority, which, on consideration of the same, will pass a speaking order. The appeal shall be decided within six months after the receipt of certified copy of this order. With these observations, present writ petition is disposed off.

The Tribunal has further held that the claimant/appellants were the legal representatives of deceased Gurmukh Singh and that the income of deceased Gurmukh Singh was Rs.650/- per FAO No.161 of 1988 2 month and the dependency has been worked out at Rs.200/- per month. A multiplier of 15 has been applied. The father of the deceased claimant/appellant No.1 has been found to be 50 years of age and mother of the deceased claimant/appellant No.2 has been found to be 45 years of age. The other claimants were the brother and sister. However, only Daljit Kaur, minor, who was 16 years of age, has filed the appeal being claimant/appellant No.3. The deceased was 23 years of age at the time of his death and was post graduate. Accordingly a multiplier of 15 was applied and a total claim of Rs.36,000/- as compensation was calculated. However, on account of the fact that the claimant/appellants had failed to prove the accident, their claim application was dismissed. It would be appropriate to make a reference to the analysis of evidence undertaken by the tribunal to reach the conclusion that the accident did not take place on 11.2.1987 at :30 p.m. The same reads as under:- In support of this issue, the claimants have examined Mohinder Singh, PW1. He has stated that on 11.2.1987 at about 5:30 PM he was coming on a Luna Moped on Moga- Ludhiana road and when he was at some distance from Aarti Cinema Chowk towards Moga side the bus came from the side of Moga which was being driven at a very fast speed and at that time the deceased was also going on a Luna Moped from the side of Moga and he was crushed by the bus driver under the bus when he was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk to go to Gurdev Nagar. In his cross- examination, he has stated that he did not see the deceased Gurmukh Singh going in front of him and he saw him for the FAO No.161 of 1988 3 first time after the accident and that he reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes of the accident. He has further admitted that it is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on that side of the round about which faces Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana. The learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the accident stands proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as referred above. In reply to this argument, the learned counsel for the respondents have argued that no accident is proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as he has clearly admitted in his cross-examination that he reached the place of accident after about 10 or 15 minutes after the accident and the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped coming from the side of Jagraon. This argument seems to be correct. In case Mohinder Singh PW1 reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident, then it means that he did not witness the accident. No other witness has been examined by the claimants to prove the accident. The case of the claimants is that one Jagdish Lal also witnessed the accident, but he has not been examined by them for the reasons best known to them. The respondents have examined Kamikkar Singh driver, respondent No.4 in rebuttal as PW1. He has denied the allegations that the accident took place with his bus. Under these circumstances, there is no evidence on the file to prove that the accident took place with the bus which was FAO No.161 of 1988 4 being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver respondent No.4 and Gurmukh Singh received injuries in that accident. Thus, this issue remains un-proved and is decided against the claimants. During the pendency of the appeal, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants filed an application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC with the prayer to place on record a copy of the FIR No.30 dated 11.2.1987, registered at Police Station Civil Line Ludhiana, an hour after the accident. The accident had taken place at 5:30 p.m. and the FIR was lodged at 6:45 p.m. Vide a separate order passed today, the afore-mentioned application has been allowed as it was not brought on record before the Tribunal. Mr. Satinder Khanna, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants has argued that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in discarding the statement made by Mohinder Singh PW1 on the ground that he was not an eye witness as he reached the place of accident after 10-15 minutes is absolutely illegal. The version disclosed in the FIR would highlight that the deceased Gurmukh Singh was going in front of Mohinder Singh, the author of the FIR, on his Luna Moped bearing registration No.PJL 5057. Mohinder Singh was also following him on his own Luna No. PAL 9024. According to learned counsel, the statement made in the court was recorded after about 8 months and the detailed authentic version has been disclosed in the FIR lodged after about one hour. Learned counsel has emphasised that had the respondents desired, they could have confronted PW1 Mohinder Singh with this FIR where the version is different than the one disclosed in the statement made before the court. He has argued that once the driver of a vehicle is tried on account of rash and negligent driving it has to be prima-facie concluded that the accident was FAO No.161 of 1988 5 caused on account of rash and negligent driving, therefore, learned counsel has argued that the findings recorded by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 are liable to be reversed and it must be held that the accident has been caused on account of rash and negligent driving by Kamikkar Singh, driver- respondent No.4. Mr.S.K.Bhanot, learned State counsel has however, submitted that the tribunal has taken into account the statement made by the witness Mohinder Singh (PW1) admitting that he had reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes and that the place of accident was not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon. So he has submitted that the FIR cannot be taken into consideration unless it is proved either by its author or any other person. Therefore, it has been suggested that the FIR cannot be taken into account at this stage and the findings deserve to be upheld. Having heard learned counsel and perusing the record of the Tribunal, I am of the considered view that the findings recorded by the Tribunal cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. The Tribunal has stretched the statement of PW1 Mohinder Singh that he reached the place of accident -15 minutes later. The statement of Mohinder Singh PW1 infact no where suggests that he was not an eye witness to the accident. The relevant portions of the statement in chief and the cross-examination are as under:- On 11.2.87 at about 5:30 PM I was coming on the Moga Ludhiana road on a Luna Moped. When I was at some distance from Aarti Cinema towards Moga side, bus No.PJG 3108 came from the side of Moga. It was being driven at a very fast speed. Gurmukh Singh was also coming on a Luna Moped from the FAO No.161 of 1988 6 side of Moga. He was ahead of the bus. When Gurmukh Singh was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk the bus crushed him to death. The bus was being driven by Kamikkar Singh driver. The bus driver did not blow the horn. The bus was out of his control on account of the high speed. Gurmukh Singh was aged about 23 years. He died at the spot. One Jagdish Lal witnessed the accident. At about 8 PM the dead body of Gurmukh Singh was taken by us to Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, where it was subjected to post mortem examination.---------- The accident took place in that chowk when Gurmukh Singh was negotiating a turn on his right side to go to Gurdev Nagar. It is incorrect to suggest that there is a bus stop on the Ludhiana Moga road in between Aarti Cinema chowk and the Aarti cinema and all the buses coming from the side of Moga stop on that bus stop. It is correct that there is a rickshaw stand in between Arti Cinema and the chowk on the left side of the road while coming from Moga. Aarti Cinema chowk is a thickly populated area and there is great rush of vehicles on that part of the road. It is incorrect to suggest that Gurmukh Singh was struck down by a truck who ran away and the bus was wrongly involved while bus was stationary on the bus stop. It is also incorrect to suggest that I was not present at the place and time of accident.---------- I had not stated in my police statement that I and the deceased were going to that side in connection with the business of our FAO No.161 of 1988 7 shop. I did not see the deceased going in front of me. I saw him after the accident. I reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident. It is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on the side of the round about. The place of accident is that part of the round about of the chowk which faces Gurdev Nagar road. I saw him dead for the first time. Many persons had gathered there at the place of accident.---------- A perusal of the statement made by PW1 Mohinder Singh would show that the deceased was going on his Luna Moped ahead of the bus and not in front of the bus. He further stated that the deceased was taking turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk and at that time the bus crushed him to death which was being driven by driver-respondent No.4. He reiterated the statement when cross-examined by the learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 and denied the suggestion that Gurmukh Singh infact had struck against the truck which ran away, while the bus was stationary on the bus stop or that he was not present at the place and time of accident. During the cross-examination by driver-respondent No.4 the witness has stated that he did not see the deceased going in front of him, but there was no contradiction between the examination-in-chief and cross- examination. As such as in the examination-in-chief the witness had stated that the deceased was going ahead of the bus. The witness further stated that he saw the deceased after the accident and had reached the place of accident or 15 minutes after the accident. The afore mentioned statement made during cross-examination does not necessarily mean that the witness was FAO No.161 of 1988 8 giving an eye witness account. In fact, the witness was explaining the circumstantial evidence which lead to an inference that the deceased was killed in the accident on account of rash and negligent driving of bus by driver Kamikkar Singh, respondent No.4. The afore mentioned version finds support from the contents of the FIR recorded after about one hour. It shows that driver-respondent No.4, after hitting Gurmukh Singh, the deceased, stopped the bus at a distance and on coming to know about the death of Gurmukh Singh-deceased, he had run away. In these circumstances the statement made in the FIR if has been used for the purpose of contradiction can also be used for the purpose of corroboration. Such is the position of law under Section 162 of Criminal Procedure Code 1973. According to the proviso to Section 162(1) of Cr.P.C, if the statement made in the FIR is proved then the same may be used by the accused and with the permission of the Court by the prosecution to contradict a witness in the manner provided by Section 145 of Evidence Act, 1872 and that any part of the statement made in the FIR could also be used for corroboration. The principle incorporated by Section 162 Cr.P.C. would be applicable and the section itself ipso-facto may not apply. If that be so than the FIR and the statement made before the court read together would lead to only one conclusion that there were adequate circumstances supporting the inference that accident was caused by the offending bus which was being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Tribunal are liable to be set aside. Even otherwise this court has held in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham reported as 1993(2) PLR 109 that once a driver has been tried of an offence of rash and negligent driving, it is prima-facie safe to conclude that FAO No.161 of 1988 9 the accident had occurred on that account.

I have also gone through the file of the Trial Court in Criminal Case No.137/2/87 which has been decided on .9.1992. Once the findings are recorded that the accident was the result of rash and negligent driving, the other question which require consideration is whether Rs.36,000/- awarded by the Tribunal in favour of the claimant/appellants was sufficient. A perusal of the record shows that the deceased Gurmukh Singh was a student of LL.B as is evident from his identity card of Government College, Ludhiana,wherein his roll number has also been disclosed. The afore mentioned photocopy of identity card is available at of the paper book. The Tribunal has proceeded on the assumption that he was drawing salary of Rs.650/- per month from a private school and would have parted with Rs.200/- to his parents, brother and sister. The Tribunal has failed to take into account the future prospectus of advancing his career by the deceased. He was a student of LL.B. and might have established his legal practice. Therefore, his salary at the rate of Rs.650/-, as a Teacher, could not have been the correct reflection of his income. The formula and the principles for working out the prospective income of a deceased have been explained in some details in G.M.Kerala SRTC Vs. Susama Thomos (1994) 2-SCC 176 and Sarla Dixit Vs. Balwant Yadav (1996)3-SCC 179. Following the afore mentioned principles the income of the deceased would work out as 650 x 3 2 = 975, which can be rounded to Rs.1000/-. The deceased would have contributed Rs.350/- per month to the claimant/appellants and the annual dependency comes to Rs.4200/-. A multiplier of 15 if applied then the total amount comes to Rs.63000/-. FAO No.161 of 1988 10 In view of the afore mentioned findings, the award of the Tribunal is modified and an amount of Rs.63000/- along with 10% interest is awarded to the claimant/appellants. The claimant/appellants No.1 & 2 are to apportion the award to the extent of 35% each and claimant/appellant No.3 along with claimant/respondents No.6 & 7 are awarded 10% each. The whole liability has to be discharged by respondents No.1 to 4 as respondent No.5 was merely an insurance company of the Moped. The appeal stands disposed of in the above terms.

    "summary": "The Tribunal has recorded findings that the claimant/appellants have not been able to prove the accident or the fact that the deceased Gurmukh Singh received injuries on account of rash and negligent driving of the bus by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. In his cross- examination, he has stated that he did not see the deceased Gurmukh Singh going in front of him and he saw him for the FAO No.161 of 1988 3 first time after the accident and that he reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes of the accident. In reply to this argument, the learned counsel for the respondents have argued that no accident is proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as he has clearly admitted in his cross-examination that he reached the place of accident after about 10 or 15 minutes after the accident and the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped coming from the side of Jagraon. Mr.S.K.Bhanot, learned State counsel has however, submitted that the tribunal has taken into account the statement made by the witness Mohinder Singh (PW1) admitting that he had reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes and that the place of accident was not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon."

    "court": "IN THE HIGH COURT FOR THE STATES OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH DATE OF ORDER: 1.12.2006 Hardeep ...Petitioner(s) Versus Sunita ....Respondent(s) CORUM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.M. AGGARWAL .*.*.*. Present: Dr. Surya Parkash, Advocate. Mr. Arun Jain, Advocate. M.M. AGGARWAL,J This is an appeal against judgment dated 24.4.1998 passed by Additional District Judge, Hisar whereby petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for dissolution of marriage filed by the present appellant i.e husband Hardeep against his wife Sunita respondent was dismissed. The marriage in this case had taken place on 10.5.1989 at Bahadurgarh. The parties had lived as husband and wife at Hansi but no child was born out of the wedlock. At the time of marriage, appellant is stated to be a Probationary Officer in Bank but he was preparing and #2# appearing for Central Services Examination. According to the appellant, respondent wife did not cooperate with him and started torturing him. She was suffering from inferiority complex and never wanted appellant to get high position in life. Then on .2.1990, when she was at matrimonial home at Hansi, she started quarrelling with him and other family members without any rhyme and reason and created a scene by coming out of the house into street and then when he along with his family members as also one Ram Kumar was present in the house, she deliberately poured kerosene oil upon herself and put her ablaze with the calculated mind of establishing that she could use coercive methods. Then he (husband appellant) had doused her flames. That respondent-wife was in fact guilty of attempting to commit suicide but she falsely got registered the case for the offence under Section 498-A IPC in which appellant, his aged parents of the appellant and sister-in-law were arrested and remained in jail for several days. Further petitioner-husband was selected in the Central Services to be posted as ACP but respondent-wife created problems. Later on, appellant was selected for HCS post and again respondent created problems against his appointment and the appellant could get the appointment only after filing writ in this Court. Earlier a petition for divorce had been filed by the husband in the year 1990, which was dismissed on merits on .10.1992 copy Annexure R-11 and appeal had been filed in this Court against that judgment but that was dismissed as husband did not pay the maintenance. In the earlier petition, ground of cruelty had been taken but since there was FIR of the occurrence dated 3.2.1990 and that matter was #3# pending trial, grounds of cruelty of incident of 3.2.1990 were not taken into consideration and discussed. In the present petition, there was an issue whether the petition was barred by principle of resjudicata. Additional District Judge had held that all the instances of cruelty except incident of .2.1990 were barred by principle of resjudicata and only incident of .2.1990 was considered and it had been held that the appellant was not entitled to decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty. Counsel for the appellant-husband had argued that the marriage took place in the year 1989. Parties had lived together only for short time and they are living separately since 1990 and it is a broken marriage. It was argued that false FIR was got registered of the incident of 3.2.1990. Appellant-husband, his father, mother and his sister were arrested and the appellant-husband could not get service as ACP and then as HCS Officer and he could get the service only after a writ petition was filed in this Court and order dated 22.7.1993 (copy Annexure P-2) was made. It was argued that in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 , it is a fit case, where marriage should be dissolved by decree of divorce. On behalf of the respondent-wife, it was argued that from the very beginning, petitioner-husband had made up his mind not to keep the wife. He had even written letter copy Annexure R-13 just after three months of the marriage. It was argued that the appellant cannot be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong. However, perusal of language of R-13 shows that petitioner wanted his wife to rise in life. From the record, it would come out that earlier petition for divorce had been filed in the year 1990 by the husband, #4# which was dismissed. There were proceedings under Section 125 Cr.P.C, which was got dismissed as withdrawn by the wife (copy Annexure P-4) on .11.1993. The present petition for divorce had been filed on 31.7.1995 and was decided on 24.4.1998, more than eight years back. Before hearing the arguments in this appeal, parties had been called to come present. They had appeared but then again it was found that no settlement between the parties in the form of mutual divorce or living together was possible. Husband is stated to be an HCS Officer whereas the wife is also stated to be employed in some private concern and may be earning some money. For the incident of 3.2.1990, an FIR No.308 dated 9.12.1990 under Section 498-A IPC had been registered at P.S City Bahadurgarh at the instance of father of the respondent-wife. Annexure P-3 shows that all the witnesses including respondent-wife had turned hostile in that case and did not support their allegations and then accused, who happened to be present appellant i.e husband Hardeep, his father, mother and sister had been acquitted on 16.8.1994. Even in spite of that, things did not improve and present petition for divorce had been filed in July 1995. Now more than 17 years have passed when the marriage took place. There had been litigation in the form of earlier petition under Section of the Hindu Marriage Act, 125 Cr.P.C, a criminal case for offence under Section 498-A IPC and second petition for divorce filed in 1995. Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 62 of the judgment reported in Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 had observed as under: Even at this stage, the respondent does not want divorce by mutual consent. From the analysis and evaluation of #5# the entire evidence, it is clear that the respondent has resolved to live in agony only to make life a miserable hell for the appellant as well. This type of adamant and callous attitude, in the context of the facts of this case, leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that the respondent is bent upon treating the appellant with mental cruelty. It is abundantly clear that the marriage between the parties had broken down irretrievably and there is no chance of their coming together, or living together again. When the case for the offence under Section 498-A IPC was registered and the husband, his sister and parents-in-law were arrested and thereafter during trial the witnesses turn hostile and husband and other relatives are acquitted, then it is itself a cruelty practised. This is further born out from the fact that father of the respondent-wife had written complaints copy Annexure P-1 so that husband does not get posting as ACP and then posting of the husband to the HCS was delayed at the instance of respondent or her father and husband could get appointment only through the intervention of the Court. In the case before Hon'ble Supreme Court, parties had been living separately for more than 10 years whereas in this case, they had been living separately for more than 16 years and there had been criminal and civil proceedings between the parties. The marriage has subsisted only in name. It has wrecked beyond the hope of salvage. Respondent still does not want divorce by mutual consent. Preservation of marriage is totally unworkable and is source of misery for the parties. Marriage has definitely #6# been irretrievably broken down.",

Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 62 of the judgment reported in Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 had observed as under: Even at this stage, the respondent does not want divorce by mutual consent. From the analysis and evaluation of #5# the entire evidence, it is clear that the respondent has resolved to live in agony only to make life a miserable hell for the appellant as well. This type of adamant and callous attitude, in the context of the facts of this case, leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that the respondent is bent upon treating the appellant with mental cruelty. It is abundantly clear that the marriage between the parties had broken down irretrievably and there is no chance of their coming together, or living together again. When the case for the offence under Section 498-A IPC was registered and the husband, his sister and parents-in-law were arrested and thereafter during trial the witnesses turn hostile and husband and other relatives are acquitted, then it is itself a cruelty practised. This is further born out from the fact that father of the respondent-wife had written complaints copy Annexure P-1 so that husband does not get posting as ACP and then posting of the husband to the HCS was delayed at the instance of respondent or her father and husband could get appointment only through the intervention of the Court. In the case before Hon'ble Supreme Court, parties had been living separately for more than 10 years whereas in this case, they had been living separately for more than 16 years and there had been criminal and civil proceedings between the parties. The marriage has subsisted only in name. It has wrecked beyond the hope of salvage. Respondent still does not want divorce by mutual consent. Preservation of marriage is totally unworkable and is source of misery for the parties. Marriage has definitely #6# been irretrievably broken down.\n\nUnder these circumstances, petition for divorce is allowed. It is directed that the marriage between the parties shall stand dissolved subject to the condition that the husband-appellant, who is an officer of Haryana Civil Services pays/deposits Rs.10,00,000/- as permanent alimony. Let Rs.5,00,000/- be paid within a period of three months and another Rs.5,00,000/- within six months. Failing to pay or deposit this permanent alimony as directed, this appeal and the petition for divorce shall stand dismissed. The amount as ordered be deposited in this Court.

    "summary": "Earlier a petition for divorce had been filed by the husband in the year 1990, which was dismissed on merits on .10.1992 copy Annexure R-11 and appeal had been filed in this Court against that judgment but that was dismissed as husband did not pay the maintenance. Additional District Judge had held that all the instances of cruelty except incident of .2.1990 were barred by principle of resjudicata and only incident of .2.1990 was considered and it had been held that the appellant was not entitled to decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty. From the record, it would come out that earlier petition for divorce had been filed in the year 1990 by the husband, #4# which was dismissed. This is further born out from the fact that father of the respondent-wife had written complaints copy Annexure P-1 so that husband does not get posting as ACP and then posting of the husband to the HCS was delayed at the instance of respondent or her father and husband could get appointment only through the intervention of the Court."

Through the present appeal the State has approached this court for reduction in compensation for the acquisition of land. Briefly, the facts of the case are that the State of Haryana vide notification dated 12.5.1995 issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, (for short, the Act ), acquired land forming part of Hadbast No. 38, in revenue estate of Bahadurgarh, District Jhajjar, for development and utilisation as residential and commercial area in Sector-9 and 9-A, Bahadurgarh. The Land Acquisition Collector assessed the market value of the land at Rs. 6 lacs per acre for the land situated on Bahadurgarh-Delhi road upto the depth of 3 acres, Rs. 4 lacs per acre for the land situated on Bahadurgarh-Najafgarh road upto the depth of 3 acres, Rs. 2.50 lacs per acre for nehri and chahi and Rs. 2 lacs per acre for barani and other kinds of land. The landowners/claimants feeling dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded by the Collector, filed objections. On reference under Section 18 of the Act, the learned court below determined the market value of the acquired land by granting increase of Rs. 50,000/- per acre in each category.

Mr. Vikas Jain, Advocate for respondent Nos.1 to 3. Respondent No.4 ex parte. Service of respondent No.5 dispensed with. L. N. MITTAL, J (ORAL) Plaintiff-Gurdev Singh having failed in both the Courts below, has filed the instant second appeal. Plaintiff-appellant alleged that he is in possession of the suit property, which is shamlat property, for more than twenty years. The defendants without any right, title or interest threatened to dispossess the plaintiff therefrom. The plaintiff sought permanent injunction restraining the defendants from forcibly dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property and from interfering in his possession thereon. Defendant Nos.1 to 4 contested the suit and denied the plaint averments. The defendants pleaded that plot Nos.12, 13, 29 and 9 min were allotted to Attar Singh migrant from Pakistan being evacuee property in lieu of his claim of property left in Pakistan. Attar -2- Singh was succeeded by his two sons Milkha Singh and Kartar Singh, who orally partitioned the said plots. Plot Nos. 29 and 9 min fell to the share of Milkha Singh and have been inherited by his sons defendant Nos.1 to 3, which became owners in possession thereof, who is the suit property. Plot Nos.12 and 13 fell to the share of Kartar Singh. Defendant Nos.1 to 3 delivered possession of the suit property to defendant No.4 vide agreement dated 13.03.1997, who is in possession thereof. Various other pleas were also raised. Defendant Nos.2 to 4 were later on proceeded ex parte. Defendant No.5 did not appear in spite of service and was proceeded ex parte in the trial Court. Learned Civil Judge (Junior Division), Nawashahr vide judgment and decree dated 17.09.2002 dismissed the plaintiff's suit. First appeal preferred by the plaintiff has been dismissed by learned Additional District Judge, Nawanshahr vide judgment and decree dated 09.08.2005. Feeling aggrieved, plaintiff has filed the instant second appeal. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the case file. Learned counsel for the appellant vehemently contended that the plaintiff-appellant is in possession of the suit property and, therefore, cannot be dispossessed therefrom except in due course of law. Reliance in support of this contention has been placed on a judgment of this Court in the case of Hukam Singh versus Tara Singh and others, 1992 Civil Court Cases 771 (P & H). The contention cannot be accepted because the plaintiff-appellant has miserably failed to prove his possession over the suit property. Oral statements -3- of plaintiff and another witness examined by him are not sufficient to prove that the plaintiff-appellant is in possession of the suit property. Third witness examined by the plaintiff is only a Draftsman, who prepared the site plan. On the other hand, statements of plaintiff's witnesses also stand rebutted by statements of the defendants' witnesses. Thus plaintiff's evidence is not sufficient to prove that he is in possession of the suit land. Moreover, mere tethering of cattle or storing of manure as pleaded by the plaintiff would not depict that he is in possession of the suit plot. Learned counsel for the appellant next contended that the lower appellate Court erroneously observed that plaintiff-appellant is not owner of the suit property and in fact even the plaintiff appellant has pleaded himself to be in possession thereof being Shamlat property. This contention also does not help the appellant because possession of vacant land is presumed to be of the owner. The evidence of plaintiff-appellant is not sufficient to prove that even without being owner of the suit land, he is in possession thereof. At the risk of repetition, it has to be mentioned that mere acts of tethering of cattle etc. do not clothe the plaintiff appellant with possession of the suit land. The plaintiff has even failed to prove the said acts that he is tethering cattle and storing manure etc. in the suit land. Learned counsel for the appellant next contended that defendants have failed to prove that the suit land was allotted to predecessor of defendant Nos.1 to 3 and has been sold by defendant Nos.1 to 3 to defendant Nos.4 and 5. It was also pointed out that learned lower appellate Court erroneously observed that defendant -4- Nos.4 and 5 are admittedly true owners of the suit land and the plaintiff appellant cannot seek injunction against them and earlier defendant Nos.1 to 3 were true owners. It was contended that finding of the trial Court on this aspect to the contrary has been reversed by lower appellate Court without recording any reasons. Relying on judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in M/s Nopany Investment (P) Ltd. versus Santokh singh (HUF), 2008(2) Civil Court Cases 300 (S.C.), learned counsel for the appellant contended that first appellate Court ought to give reasons for reversing the finding of the trial Court. The entire contention is misconceived and devoid of merit. Irrespective of whether defendants or any of them are owners of the suit property or not, the plaintiff cannot succeed unless he proves his own possession over the suit property. However, the plaintiff has failed to prove his possession over the suit property and, therefore, he has been rightly non-suited by the Courts below. There is concurrent finding by both the Courts below holding that plaintiff is not proved to be in possession of the suit property. The said finding is based on proper appreciation of evidence and is supported by cogent reasons. The said finding does not warrant interference in second appeal. No question of law, much less substantial question of law, arises for determination in the instant second appeal. The appeal is found to be without any merit and is accordingly dismissed. .11.2010.
