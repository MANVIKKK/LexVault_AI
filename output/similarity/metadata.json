State of Maharashtra Respondent Through jail. Mr.P.A.Pol, PP for State. CORAM: B.H.MARLAPALLE & SMT.ROSHAN S. DALVI,JJ. October 16, 2009. P.C. . Shri Farooq Mirza Hussein Ravi appellant no.2 and accused no.3 had submitted an application dated 8/10/2007 through the Superintendent, Yerwada Central Prison at Pune praying for the benefit of Section 427(1) of Cr.P.C. Said prayer was reiterated by his subsequent applications dated 29/2/2008 and 27/3/2008. . Criminal Appeal Nos.739 and 748 of 1982 came to be decided by a common judgment dated 1st August, 1984 by a Division Bench of this Court and the sentence awarded to accused no.3 - Farooq Mirza Hussein Miya Ravi (accused no.1 in Sessions Case No.508 of 1980) was directed to run concurrently with the sentence awarded to him in Sessions Case No.509 of . It is apparent that in Sessions Case No.508 of 1980 the applicant was arraigned as accused no.1 and in Sessions Case No.509 of 1980 he was arraigned as accused no.3. From the order of conviction and sentence passed in Sessions Case No. of 1980, these appeals came to be filed and while the appeals were allowed in respect of accused nos.1 and 4 partly, the order of conviction and sentence against applicant-accused was confirmed. From the report received by Mr.Pol from the Yerwada Central Prison at Pune it is clear that no appeal was filed from the order of conviction and sentence passed in Sessions Case No.508 of 1980. In the said case he was sentenced for the offence punishable under Section 392 of IPC on 31/8/1983 and sentenced to suffer RI for seven years. In Sessions Case No.509 of 1980 he was convicted for the very same offence and sentenced for the same period of seven years as per the order dated 18/9/1982 and, therefore, the sentence awarded to him in Sessions Case No.508 of 1980 was to run concurrently with the sentence awarded and confirmed by this Court in Sessions Case No.509 of 1980 and in the judgment and order dated 1/8/1984 referred to hereinabove this Court had extended the said benefit to the applicant. Despite this it appears that Criminal Writ Petition No. 3605 of came to be filed before this Court which was decided on /8/1984 and it was directed that the sentence awarded in Sessions Case No.508 of 1980 and Sessions Case No.1980 was to be concurrent and not consecutive. The applicant had surrendered to the jail to undergo sentence on 8/10/1983. On /4/1984 he was released on parole of 30 days and he absconded for almost twenty years i.e. till he was arrested on /4/2004. For the same he was punished and after his re-arrest on 4/4/2004 he was also given the benefit of set off within the meaning of Section 428 of Cr.P.C. and on suffering the sentence he has been released on 12/8/2008 by taking into consideration the orders passed on 1/8/1984 as well as on 7/8/1984 by this Court for the benefit under Section 427(1) of Cr.P.C. .

Respondents Mr. Santosh Shetty i/b Mr. M.M. Vashi for the petitioner. Mr. D.B. Sawant for the respondent Nos.1 and 2. CORAM: ANOOP V. MOHTA, J. DATED: 23RD AUGUST, 2004. ORAL JUDGMENT : . The present Petition is under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, filed by the petitioner (Assistant teacher) and thereby, has challenged the order and judgment dated 27th October, 1989, passed by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, Mumbai [for short Tribunal ], in Appeal No. GEN/71/SND/3 of , whereby, the Tribunal, had allowed the Appeal but only granted the benefit under Section 11(2)(e) of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 (for short MEPS Act ) and directed to pay six months' salary by way of compensation instead of reinstatement, although the termination order dated 30th March, 1988, of the petitioner was set aside. The Petitioner, being aggrieved, therefore, has basically prayed for reinstatement as permanent Assistant Teacher and all other benefits. . Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. The basic issue which needs to be answered in this Petition is the right of the petitioner, being an open category candidate, to have a status of permanency as Assistant Teacher on a reserved post. . The provisions of the MEPS Act and the Rules made thereunder govern the recruitment and conditions of service of employees in private Schools. The relevant Sections are Sections 4, 5 and 9. The relevant Rules are called the Maharashtra Employees of Private School Rules [for short `MEPS Rules']. The relevant Rules, which covers the case in hand, are Rule 9 and 28. . The petitioner was appointed temporarily in the post of Assistant Teacher for the period 1984-1985 and 1985-1986. Thereafter, he was appointed on probation for a period of two years under Section 9(5) of the MEPS Act. The said appointment order itself contained a clause that his appointment would be subject to the approval of the Education Department of District Sindhudurg. The respondent-Management, however, by an order dated 30th March, 1988, terminated the services of the petitioner. The petitioner, therefore, preferred an Appeal under Section 9 of the MPES Act and Rules. The School Tribunal, after considering the contentions raised, including the written submissions filed by respondents, passed the impugned order and held that the impugned termination notice dated 30th March, 1988, was illegal, invalid and improper. Accordingly, the Appeal was allowed. However, not granted reinstatement with back wages, after recording the statement that 'a suitable substitute from S.T. category is posted'. The respondents were directed to give him six months salary only. . It appears from the record, as well as, the Written Statement filed by the Management that the post in question was reserved for SC/ST candidate. As per the advertisement, the petitioner was appointed for the respective years, subject to the approval from the Education Department, Zilla Parishad, Sindhudurg. The said appointment was purely temporary. As there was no candidate available, belonging to the said reserved category, petitioner was appointed temporarily, on the said post. The said process was continued for two years more. The respondent's case is that as the candidate belonging to the reserved category were not available or did not respond to the advertisement and, therefore, were left with no choice, but to appoint the petitioner on a temporary basis. The foundation of the respondents cannot be overlooked as the post was meant for reserved categories and this post was always subject to the approval from the Education Department. There is no dispute that the petitioner belongs to the open category. The petitioner's entitlement to enjoy the post, in the circumstances, would be subject to the non-availability of reserved category candidate or such other candidate. The fact that he was appointed from time to time from the year 1984 upto 1987-1988, by that itself, nowhere gives any right to such candidate to claim permanency, even after expiry of the alleged probation period, in the facts and circumstances of the case. . In this background and in view of the submission as raised and as referred in the Written Statement, as well as, recorded by the Tribunal in paragraph , I am also of the view that now, at this stage, i.e. after more than 15 years, it is difficult to accept the prayer of reinstatement. The finding given by the Tribunal is also justified to maintain the order to the effect that 'unless the said post becomes de-reserved', a candidate appointed temporarily on such vacancy of ST/SC category would have only status of 'temporary' candidate. . A candidate from the open category cannot claim a right of permanency, on the said reserved post. There is nothing pointed out that such post becomes de-reserved automatically after lapse of time or any other such things. In the circumstances, appellant being open category candidate would have no right to hold the post meant for reserved category candidate. The `quota' or any action based on the Reservation Policy cannot be disturbed without following the due procedure of law. . It needs to be mentioned here that if candidates belonging to the SC/ST category are not available, the petitioner's case may be considered by the Management, if there is still a vacancy and/or the post is still required to be filled in. However, the Management is at liberty to consider this aspect, if a case is made out on merit. . In view of this observation, I decline to interfere with the finding recorded by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, dated 27th October, 1989, hence termination is upheld. . The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of. No order as to costs. Certified copy expedited. [ANOOP V. MOHTA, J.]",

Perused the order dated 29.1.2003. By the report the Receiver seeks modification of order dated 29.1.2003 passed by this Court on the Receiver's report. Order dated 29.1.2003 reads as under:- \"The learned Counsel appearing for plaintiff /decree holder states that there is no order passed in execution of the decree, according to which, the Receiver can take possession of the property to which the decree relates. The statement is accepted. In view of this statement, the Receiver's report is disposed of.\" According to the Receiver's report there is an order made by the Court directing the Receiver to take possession of the property. Even assuming that the statement made by the Receiver in the report is correct, the Receiver is appointed in execution of a decree for benefit of the decree holder. When the Receiver takes possession in execution of the decree obviously it is for the benefit of the decree holder. But when the decree holder himself says that the Receiver is not entitled to take possession then, in my opinion, the inquiry should end. The learned Counsel appearing for decree holder even today says that there is no order authorising the Receiver to take possession of the property in relation to which the decree is passed. He has made the same statement before the Court on 29.1.2003 also, which has been recorded by the Court. In this view of the matter, there is no point in Receiver maintaining possession because the Receiver is maintaining possession obviously for the benefit of the decree holder. In this view of the matter therefore, the Receiver is directed to hand over the possession of the property back to the party from whom the Receiver has taken possession. The Report is disposed of. ---",

Joshi, for the Plaintiffs in S. 4339/95 & Defendant in TS /95 of 4 CORAM: G.S. PATEL, J DATED: rd March 2015 PC:- . Testamentary Suit No. 72 of 1989 arose out of the Testamentary Petition No. 494 of 1989 upon a caveat being filed. The disputes between the Caveator and the Petitioner were resolved and Minutes were filed on 2nd December 1992. . Despite these minutes, it appears that the Petition remained pending since certain office objections had not been removed. While it remained in that state, a second Caveat was filed on the very same Testamentary Petition No. 494 of 1989. This resulted in that very Petition being once again renumbered, this time as Testamentary Suit No. 56 of 1995. Thus, the position was that in a single Testamentary Petition propounding one Will, there were two contested actions each separately numbered as a Suit. . The Caveator in the first Testamentary Suit No. 72 of 1989 then filed Suit No. 3255 of 1995 seeking to have the Minutes of the order dated 2nd December 1992 set aside. . There is a fourth action, and this is a Suit No. 4339 of 1995, which is for partition. . On 27th March 2012 issues were framed in Testamentary Suit No. 56 of 1995 and in partition Suit No. 4339 of 1995. There of 4 was thereafter, a further order of 6th July 2012 which inter alia directed that Suit No. 3255 of 1995 (seeking to set aside the Minutes of the order dated 2nd December 1992) was to be heard along with the subsequent Testamentary Suit No. 56 of 1995. In Suit No. 3255 of 1995 issues were framed on 20th March 2012. . The result of this is that, leaving aside the partition Suit, Suit No. 3255 of 1995 and Testamentary Suit No. 56 of 1995 were required to proceed to trial. The Plaintiff in Suit No.3255 of 1995 is or was the Caveator/Defendant in the first Testamentary Suit No.72 of 1989. Since evidence in Suit No.3255 of 1995 and Testamentary Suit No. 56 of 1995 is common, the concerns of the Plaintiff in Suit No.3255 of 1995 in relation to the challenge to the Will in Testamentary Suit No.72 of 1989 are fully taken care of. . Mr. Shukla, learned Counsel for the Plaintiffs in Testamentary Suit No. 56 of 1995, states that the Plaintiff in that Suit has already led the evidence of two witnesses, both of whom has been cross examined not only by the Caveator in Testamentary Suit No. 56 of 1995 but also by the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 3255 of . Reserving his right to lead evidence in rebuttal, Mr. Shukla closes the Plaintiffs case in the subsequent Testamentary Suit No. of 1995. . The Caveator/Defendant in Testamentary Suit No. 56 of and the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 3255 of 1995 will now file and serve their respective Affidavits of Documents, compilations of documents and Affidavits in lieu of Examination in Chief on or before 23rd March 2015. List this group of matters for marking of of 4 documents of the Defendant in Testamentary Suit No. 56 of 1995 and the Plaintiffs in Suit No. 3255 of 1995 on 30th March 2015, high on board. (G. S.

Clause 1 speaks of temporary alternate accommodation on getting of which the Petitioner and the Respondent were to stay together as per the undertaking given by the Respondent who was the petitioner in the writ petition. Learned counsel for the Respondent states that he has not obtained the possession of the temporary accommodation but he is ready to have the permanent accommodation. The grievance of the petitioner is that she is not allowed to occupy the permanent accommodation. Therefore he cannot take care of her. The matter has been complied in terms of the undertaking given. The contempt petition therefore does not lie. It is therefore dismissed.",

Kakad Investments & Ors. .. Defendants Mr. S.S. Deshmukh i/b Pravin B. Gole for the Plaintiff. Mr. Swanand Chougule for Defendant No.1. Mr. Dilip R. Talekar, Insolvency Registrar present in Court. CORAM : K.R. SHRIRAM, J. DATED : 7TH OCTOBER, 2016. P.C. The Suit came to be settled by consent of the parties on 8th October 1985. Consent terms were drawn. A consent decree in terms of the consent terms is passed. The consent decree states that it is to operate as a conveyance in favour of the Plaintiff. The Consent Decree becomes a conveyance as defined under Section 2(g) (iii) of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958, which runs thus : S.2(g) Conveyance includes, (i) (ii) (iii) Every decree or final order of any Civil Court. (iv) By which property, whether movable or immovable, or any estate or interest in any property is transferred to, or vested in, any other person, inter vivos, and which is not otherwise specifically provided for by Schedule I . Waghmare 1/3 .s.2459.1985.doc Hence a consent decree passed pursuant to Consent Terms operates as a decree of the court. The said definition came into force on 10th December , pursuant to the substitution of the definition for the previous definition by the Amendment Act of 1985. Upon the consent terms operating as a decree of the court and being termed a conveyance in favour of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff derived title to the suit property. The Plaintiff as the owner of the suit property, acquired all the rights of ownership. The utilization and enjoyment of those rights require the original document of conveyance to be in the possession of the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff to be able to use the document to show his title. This becomes essential more specially when the Plaintiff is required to transfer his title either by way of mortgage, sale, lease, etc, when the original document of title would be required to be handed over to the transferee. The Plaintiff has got the consent decree operating as conveyance registered and stamped in accordance with Law. The Plaintiff is required to be returned the original document of title. Waghmare 2/3 .s.2459.1985.doc All original documents produced by parties are, as a matter of practice returned to them after the final judgment is pronounced and the suit is disposed of. There is, therefore, no reason not to return the original document of title to the Plaintiff. Further, this issue has been dealt with by a decision of this Court in K. Raheja Corporation Private Limited Vs Mrs Goolestan Peter Coelho and Others, where it was directed that a consent decree be handed over to the Plaintiff in that case. I also find support of an order dated 23.12.2015 passed in Suit No.2225 of 1993. In a matter such as this, therefore, the Plaintiff would be entitled to the return of the original consent decree. The office of the Prothonotary and Senior Master shall make a certified copy of the consent decree filed in the suit and operating as a conveyance to be kept on record of this suit and return the original decree to the Plaintiff within four weeks.

Pratap for Mr.D.K.Desai and Mrs.M.K. Desai. Mr.P. Ramarao, Official Liquidator present. CORAM : S.J. VAZIFDAR, J. DATED : 26TH FEBRUARY, 2009. P.C. : 1. There is nothing on record which warrants impleading the son of the director against whom misfeasance proceedings were initiated. The director expired in March, 2001. His son was not a director of the company. The report does not indicate any connection between the son and the company or even between the son and any of the assets of the company. In the circumstances, the directions sought in paragraphs 6(a) of the report are refused. 2. The wife of the director was also a director of the company. Hence the report is made absolute in terms of paragraph 6(b). Mr.Pratap states that the director s wife is not aware of the working of the company as she was not incharge of the affairs of the company. Be that as it may, an affidavit is required to be filed by her. Affidavit shall be filed within eight weeks from today.",

Deshpande, Advocate for the Official Liquidator with Mr. Deepak Persoya, Official Liquidator CORAM : ANIL L. PANSARE, J. DATE : -03-2025 On 21-3-2025, following order was passed. Heard. . The Laxmi Bank Limited has filed this petition with following prayers. (a) That the company be ordered to be would up by this Honourable Court under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956; (b) The Official Liquidator or some other fit and proper person be appointed as the Official Liquidator with all powers under the . . The Laxmi Bank Ltd. has averred that the company by name, Gopaldas Mohatta & Company Limited was incorporated at Nagpur on 25.05.1941. The name of the company was later on changed to Navbharat Trading Company Private Limited (company under liquidation), in the meeting of shareholders dated 28.07.1947. The authorized capital of the company was Rs.10,00,000/- and the subscribed and issued capital was Rs.1,61,200/-. The company had multiple objects including trading, financing, etc. It appears that the company had issued three cheques to Laxmi Investment Company Pvt. Ltd., total amounting to Rs.1,35,000/-. It further appears that Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. had a current account with the petitioner bank at Bombay, Fort Branch. The aforesaid three cheques were presented by Laxmi Investment Company Ltd., which were returned with remark, Refer to drawer . According to the petitioner, the Company did not have sufficient funds in its :BHC-NAG:3212 (2) cmp 8.1961 account with the said branch. The petitioner bank, however, paid the amount of the aforesaid three cheques drawn on company s account with an assumption that the amount of cheques deposited by the company in its account would be met. According to the petitioner, the amount, that was payable by the company under liquidation was to the tune of Rs.1,14,000/- and accordingly on 18.07.1961, the liquidator of the petitioner company addressed a notice of payment to Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd., calling upon the company to pay the sum of Rs.1,14,000/-. The envelope containing notice was, however, not accepted by the company under liquidation. . I am informed that not only the company under liquidation i.e. Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. but also the other company, Laxmi Investment Company Pvt. Ltd. and Laxmi Bank are under liquidation. In addition, a company namely, National Commercial Corporation Ltd. was also under liquidation in Company Petition No.9/1961, which came to be dissolved by this Court vide order dated 09.06.2022. . Thus, what remains is the three other companies which are subject matter of Company Petition No.8/1961 (present petition) in respect of Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd., Company Petition No.12/1961 in respect of Laxmi Investment Co. Ltd. and Company Petition No.14/1960 in respect of Laxmi Bank Ltd., the proceeding being initiated by the Reserve Bank of India. The winding up proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. have been initiated by Laxmi Bank. . Thus, it appears that Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. were holding accounts with Laxmi Bank. It further appears that some financial benefits were extended by Laxmi Bank to Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd and accordingly Laxmi Bank proceeded to file liquidation proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. however, prior thereto Laxmi Bank itself was subject matter of winding up proceeding at the instance of the Reserve Bank of India. That appears to be the reason why Liquidator of Laxmi Bank has filed the proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company Pvt. Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. (3) cmp 8.1961 . Coming back to the present proceeding, the Official Liquidator submits that as on 31.12.2024, Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. has no assets except one fixed deposit of Rs.1,48,117/-. The Official Liquidator submits that there are two creditors. One is Laxmi Bank, for Rs.3,60,000/- another is Sales Tax Department, Akola for Rs.36,357/-. Mr. Deshpande, learned counsel for the Official Liquidator, submits that the claim of Laxmi Bank will have to be processed first, in terms of Section 529 of the Companies Act, 1956 and since the amount lying to the credit of the company is not sufficient to pay the entire amount of Laxmi Bank, the Company under liquidation is not in a position to pay dues to the Sales Tax Department, Akola. . The Official Liquidator, however, seeks further time to verify whether there are any other assets belonging to Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. Stand over to 28.03.2025. As could be seen, Laxmi Bank Limited has initiated the present petition. The amount due and payable to Laxmi Bank Limited is/was Rs. 1,14,000/-. . The Official Liquidator submits that there are no assets of Navbharat Trading Company Private Limited. He submits that the amount of Rs. 1,48,117/- is, however, lying to the credit of company and accordingly, seeks permission to pay the amount to Laxmi Bank Limited after adjusting amount towards administrative and other expenses. Permission granted. The amount be paid within two weeks from today. . The Official Liquidator shall pay to Laxmi Bank Limited the amount which is lying to its credit after meeting administrative and other expenses. . The Official Liquidator submits that upon doing aforesaid exercise, nothing would remain with Navbharat Trading Company Private Limited to continue with liquidation proceedings and hence (4) cmp 8.1961 request is made to dissolve the company under Section 481 of the Companies Act, 1956. . Thus, it appears that the Official Liquidator cannot proceed with the winding up of the company for want of fund and asset. It is thus just and reasonable to order dissolution of the company in terms of Section 481 of the Companies Act. Hence, following order is passed. ORDER (i) Company named Navbharat Trading Company Private Limited stands dissolved in terms of Section 481(1) of the Companies Act, 1956 subject to compliance of direction in paragraph no. 2 of the order. (ii) The Official Liquidator shall forward copy of order to the Registrar of Companies in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 481 of the Companies Act. (iii) The Official Liquidator shall file report of payment of dues to the Registrar(Judicial) of this Court within two weeks from today. (iv) The company petition is disposed of in above terms.

DATE : -03-2025 Heard. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has initiated present proceedings to wind up Laxmi Bank Limited. RBI noted various discrepancies which includes utilization of bank s fund for personal use by the Chairman-cum-Director of the bank as also extending cash credit facility to certain entities without holding stocks. RBI found that continuance of the company i.e. Laxmi Bank Limited will be prejudicial to the interest of its depositors and accordingly proposed winding up. The Official Liquidator submits that there were depositors/unsecured creditors. The total amount due and payable to the depositors was Rs. 1,78,03053/-, out of which Rs. 1,51,29,784/- has been paid. Thus, balance amount of Rs. 26,73,269/- is to be paid. The Official Liquidator submits that to the credit of bank is lying an amount of Rs. 1,53,71,295/-.

The Laxmi Investment Company Private Limited, which is a company under liquidation, was incorporated on 29.12.1944 under the provisions of the Indian Companies Act VII of 1913 as a public company limited by shares. . The Official Liquidator appointed for Laxmi Bank Pvt. Ltd., filed proceedings for winding up of the company under liquidation viz. Laxmi Investment Company Pvt. Ltd. on the count that five cheques for aggregate sum of Rs.2,39,000/- were issued by the company in favour of M/s. National Commercial Corporation Pvt. Ltd. The company was holding account with petitioner bank (which is also in liquidation). It appears that the company was not having sufficient funds. The petitioner bank, however, cleared the cheques on the assurance given by the company to pay back the sum. Thus, in a way, the Over Draft facility was extended by the petitioner bank to the company under liquidation who failed to deposit the aforesaid amount and accordingly present petition came to be filed. . Having heard Mr. Shrinivas Deshpande, learned counsel for the Official Liquidator, the status of the company is such that, to its credit an amount of Rs.6,00,000/- approximately is lying. There are no assets nor is there any liability except for payment to the (2) 1cmp12.61 petitioner - the Laxmi Bank Ltd. Accordingly the Official Liquidator has proposed dissolution of the company. . The request being in tune with the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 (for short the, Act of 1956 ), it is accepted. As stated above, the amount lying to the credit of the company is about Rs.6,00,000/-. The amount payable to the petitioner is Rs.2,39,000/-. There are no other creditors. The amount be paid to the petitioner, in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1956, including interest, if any, after deducting the administrative and other ancillary charges. Since there is no other creditor, nothing survives in the petition. The affairs of the company, thus, stands completely wound up. . In view thereof, company namely, the Laxmi Investment Company Pvt.

Respondents Mr. Santosh Shetty i/b Mr. M.M. Vashi for the petitioner. Mr. D.B. Sawant for the respondent Nos.1 and 2. CORAM: ANOOP V. MOHTA, J. DATED: 23RD AUGUST, 2004. ORAL JUDGMENT : . The present Petition is under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India, filed by the petitioner (Assistant teacher) and thereby, has challenged the order and judgment dated 27th October, 1989, passed by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, Mumbai [for short Tribunal ], in Appeal No. GEN/71/SND/3 of , whereby, the Tribunal, had allowed the Appeal but only granted the benefit under Section 11(2)(e) of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 (for short MEPS Act ) and directed to pay six months' salary by way of compensation instead of reinstatement, although the termination order dated 30th March, 1988, of the petitioner was set aside. The Petitioner, being aggrieved, therefore, has basically prayed for reinstatement as permanent Assistant Teacher and all other benefits. . Heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. The basic issue which needs to be answered in this Petition is the right of the petitioner, being an open category candidate, to have a status of permanency as Assistant Teacher on a reserved post. . The provisions of the MEPS Act and the Rules made thereunder govern the recruitment and conditions of service of employees in private Schools. The relevant Sections are Sections 4, 5 and 9. The relevant Rules are called the Maharashtra Employees of Private School Rules [for short `MEPS Rules']. The relevant Rules, which covers the case in hand, are Rule 9 and 28. . The petitioner was appointed temporarily in the post of Assistant Teacher for the period 1984-1985 and 1985-1986. Thereafter, he was appointed on probation for a period of two years under Section 9(5) of the MEPS Act. The said appointment order itself contained a clause that his appointment would be subject to the approval of the Education Department of District Sindhudurg. The respondent-Management, however, by an order dated 30th March, 1988, terminated the services of the petitioner. The petitioner, therefore, preferred an Appeal under Section 9 of the MPES Act and Rules. The School Tribunal, after considering the contentions raised, including the written submissions filed by respondents, passed the impugned order and held that the impugned termination notice dated 30th March, 1988, was illegal, invalid and improper. Accordingly, the Appeal was allowed. However, not granted reinstatement with back wages, after recording the statement that 'a suitable substitute from S.T. category is posted'. The respondents were directed to give him six months salary only. . It appears from the record, as well as, the Written Statement filed by the Management that the post in question was reserved for SC/ST candidate. As per the advertisement, the petitioner was appointed for the respective years, subject to the approval from the Education Department, Zilla Parishad, Sindhudurg. The said appointment was purely temporary. As there was no candidate available, belonging to the said reserved category, petitioner was appointed temporarily, on the said post. The said process was continued for two years more. The respondent's case is that as the candidate belonging to the reserved category were not available or did not respond to the advertisement and, therefore, were left with no choice, but to appoint the petitioner on a temporary basis. The foundation of the respondents cannot be overlooked as the post was meant for reserved categories and this post was always subject to the approval from the Education Department. There is no dispute that the petitioner belongs to the open category. The petitioner's entitlement to enjoy the post, in the circumstances, would be subject to the non-availability of reserved category candidate or such other candidate. The fact that he was appointed from time to time from the year 1984 upto 1987-1988, by that itself, nowhere gives any right to such candidate to claim permanency, even after expiry of the alleged probation period, in the facts and circumstances of the case. . In this background and in view of the submission as raised and as referred in the Written Statement, as well as, recorded by the Tribunal in paragraph , I am also of the view that now, at this stage, i.e. after more than 15 years, it is difficult to accept the prayer of reinstatement. The finding given by the Tribunal is also justified to maintain the order to the effect that 'unless the said post becomes de-reserved', a candidate appointed temporarily on such vacancy of ST/SC category would have only status of 'temporary' candidate. . A candidate from the open category cannot claim a right of permanency, on the said reserved post. There is nothing pointed out that such post becomes de-reserved automatically after lapse of time or any other such things. In the circumstances, appellant being open category candidate would have no right to hold the post meant for reserved category candidate. The `quota' or any action based on the Reservation Policy cannot be disturbed without following the due procedure of law. . It needs to be mentioned here that if candidates belonging to the SC/ST category are not available, the petitioner's case may be considered by the Management, if there is still a vacancy and/or the post is still required to be filled in. However, the Management is at liberty to consider this aspect, if a case is made out on merit. . In view of this observation, I decline to interfere with the finding recorded by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, dated 27th October, 1989, hence termination is upheld. . The Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of. No order as to costs. Certified copy expedited. [ANOOP V. MOHTA, J.]",

    "court": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH Criminal Revision No. 1057 of 1997 Date of Decision : July, 02, 2010 Balbir ....Petitioner Versus State of Haryana .....Respondent CORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE T.P.S. MANN Present : Mr. Ishwar Lal, Advocate Mr. Manish Deswal, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana T.P.S. MANN, J. (Oral) The petitioner was tried for an offence under Section 379 of the Indian Penal Code on the allegations that on 8.3.1991 at about 5.00 p.m. in the area of Bus Stand, Sadhaura, he committed theft of Rs.110/- by taking that amount out of the possession of complainant-Maha Singh. Vide judgment and order dated 10/11.10.1995, Additional Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jagadhri convicted him for the aforementioned offence and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-. Aggrieved of his conviction and sentence, the petitioner filed an appeal but the same was dismissed by Additional Sessions Judge, Yamuna Nagar on 3.11.1997. Consequently, he was taken into custody so as to serve the sentence imposed upon him. He then filed the present revision in which he was granted the concession of Crl. Revision No. 1057 of 1997 -2- bail on 10.12.1997. Learned counsel for the petitioner has not challenged the conviction of the petitioner for the offence under Section 379 IPC. However, he has submitted that the occurrence in question had taken place more than nineteen years earlier. The amount said to have been stolen by the petitioner was recovered from him when he was shown to have been apprehended while running away from the spot. The petitioner is not a previous convict. He has already deposited the fine imposed upon him by the trial Court. Out of the sentence of one year, he has served an actual period of one and a half months. Therefore, the sentence of imprisonment imposed upon the petitioner be reduced to that already undergone by him. On the other hand, learned State counsel has opposed the prayer made on behalf of the petitioner by submitting that the petitioner had pushed the complainant while alighting from a bus at Bus Stand Sadhaura and in the process took out Rs.110/- from the right pocket of the pant worn by the complainant. He tried to run away from the spot but was overpowered by the persons present there and the amount of Rs.110/- was recovered from him. Therefore, he does not deserve any leniency in the matter of sentence. When the petitioner was heard by the trial Court on the quantum of sentence, he had stated that he had small children to support and was the only bread earner of the family. The petitioner has been Crl. Revision No. 1057 of 1997 -3- facing the agony of criminal prosecution since the month of March, . From the records, it is apparent that after being taken into custody on 8.3.1991, the petitioner was released on bail on 9.3.1991. He was again taken into custody on 3.11.1997 when his appeal against his conviction and sentence was dismissed by the lower appellate Court. It was only on 10.12.1997 that he was ordered to be released on bail. Taking into consideration the totality of the circumstances, the Court is of the view that no useful purpose would be served by sending the petitioner behind the bars, once again, for undergoing the remainder of his sentence. Ends of justice would be amply met if the substantive sentence of the petitioner is reduced to that already undergone by him. Resultantly, the conviction of the petitioner under Section IPC is upheld. His substantive sentence of imprisonment is reduced to that already undergone by him. Except for the modification in the quantum of sentence of imprisonment to the extent as indicated above, the revision fails and is, therefore, dismissed. ( T.P.S. MANN ) July 02, 2010 JUDGE ajay-1",

JUSTICE T.P.S. MANN Present : Mr. D.S. Malwai, Advocate as Amicus Curiae for the petitioner. Mr. Rajiv Sharma, Advocate for Union Territory, Chandigarh. T.P.S. MANN, J. (Oral) The petitioner was tried for the offence punishable under Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act on the allegations that on 13.6.1990, he was found in possession of about 500 bottles of sweetened carbonated water (orange) for sale in village Darua and the sample drawn therefrom was found to contain brominated vegetable oil, use of which was not permitted. Vide judgment and order dated 13.9.1994, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Chandigarh convicted the petitioner for the aforementioned offence and sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for one month. The amount of fine was paid. Aggrieved of his conviction and sentence, the petitioner filed -2- an appeal but the same was dismissed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Chandigarh on 1.3.1997 by maintaining his conviction and sentence. Learned counsel for the petitioner has not challenged the conviction of the petitioner. However, he has submitted that the sample was drawn from the petitioner on 13.6.1990. After receipt of the report from the Chemical Examiner, the criminal proceedings were initiated against the petitioner in the month of October, 1990 when a criminal complaint was filed by the Food Inspector. Ever since then, the petitioner has been facing the agony of criminal prosecution. The present revision has remained pending in this Court for the last more than 13 years. Consequent upon the dismissal of his appeal by the lower appellate Court, the petitioner was taken into custody on 1.3.1997 and it was only on 18.3.1997 that he was granted the concession of bail during the pendency of his revision. Therefore, the substantive sentence of the petitioner be reduced to that already undergone by him. Learned counsel representing the Union Territory of Chandigarh has opposed the prayer made on behalf of the petitioner by submitting that as the sweetened carbonated water (orange) sold by the petitioner was found adulterated, therefore, the petitioner has rightly been sentenced to minimum imprisonment and fine and the same cannot be reduced. In Parshadi V State of Haryana 2004(2) R.C.R. (Criminal) , the sentence of a similarly situated accused, who stood convicted under Section 7 read with Section 16(1)(a)(i) of the Act was reduced to -3- that already undergone by him as he had been facing the trial for a period of fourteen years. However, his fine was enhanced. While doing so, the Court relied upon a number of judgments, viz, Mahavir V. State through Govt. Food Inspector, 2000(4) RCR(Crl.) 208, Behari Lal V. State of (U.T.) Chandigarh, 2000(1) RCR(Crl.) 222, Des Raj V. The State of Haryana, 1996(1) RCR 689, Vijay Kumar V. The State of Haryana 1996 (2) RCR(Crl.) 554 (P&H), Mohinder Singh V. State (Chandigarh Administration), 1997(2) RCR(Crl.) 168 (P&H) and Satpal V. State of Haryana, 1997(4) RCR(Crl.) 15 (P&H). In Narinder Kumar V. State of Haryana 2008(2) All India Criminal Law Reporter 288, this Court, once again, reduced the sentence of a similarly situated convict to that already undergone by him as the occurrence pertained to the year 1984. It is a fact that the sword of criminal prosecution has remained hanging on the head of the petitioner for the last more than 20 years. The present revision has remained pending in this Court for more than 13 years. Out of the sentence of six months imposed upon him, the petitioner has already undergone a period of three weeks. When the petitioner was heard by the trial Court on the quantum of sentence, he had pleaded that he was a young person of 27 years of age and had a long way to go. There is no material on the file that the petitioner is a previous convict or that he is involved in any other crime. Keeping in view the observations made by different High Courts in the aforementioned judgments, I am of the view that no useful purpose would be served by sending the petitioner behind the bars, once again, so as to undergo -4- remainder of his sentence. Ends of justice would be amply met if the substantive sentence of the petitioner is reduced to that already undergone by him and at the same time enhancing the fine of Rs.1,000/- to Rs.10,000/-. Resultantly, the conviction of the petitioner for the offence under Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act is maintained. His substantive sentence of imprisonment is reduced to that already undergone by him. The fine of Rs.1,000/- is enhanced to Rs.10,000/-. The enhanced amount of fine be deposited by the petitioner with the trial Court within three months from today, failing which he shall be required to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months. The revision is, accordingly, disposed of. ( T.P.S.MANN ) May 27, 2010 JUDGE satish",

Present revision petition is directed against the order passed by the Rent Controller whereby application filed by the petitioner for leading additional evidence has been dismissed. Learned counsel for the petitioner has assailed the order. He has submitted that landlord was residing at a distant place. For this reason, he could not depose before the Rent Controller at the time of affirmative evidence. The court below has, thus, erred in rejecting the application for leading additional evidence. He has relied upon judgment of this court reported as Charan Singh vs. Ajit Singh 1999(Suppl.) Civil Court Cases 458. Learned counsel for the respondent has opposed the plea. He submits that petitioner has merely delayed the matter. Petitioner was granted ample opportunity to lead evidence in affirmative. He is merely trying to fill up lacuna in the case. Thus, trial court has rightly rejected his prayer for leading additional evidence. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. An eviction petition was instituted by respondent- landlord in the year 2001. After issues were framed, 7 effective opportunities were granted to him for leading evidence but petitioner failed to examine any witness. Petitioner closed his evidence on 05.05.2003. He, however, tendered a copy of the rent note which was taken on record by the trial court as mark A . Thereafter, evidence of the respondent was recorded. At the time case came up for rebuttal evidence, petitioner made an effort to lead affirmative evidence. He examined one witness Ram Phal, an official from Food & Supply department. Instant application for leading additional evidence was moved thereafter. Trial court rejected the plea observing that petitioner was granted sufficient opportunity to lead his evidence in affirmative but he failed to do so. I find no infirmity with the order passed by the court below. The judgment relied upon by counsel for the petitioner in Charan Singh case (supra) is not applicable to facts of this case. In any case, petitioner has not been able to show that evidence could not produced earlier despite due diligence. On the other hand, he was granted 7 effective opportunities but he failed to adduce evidence. Eviction petition has been pending before the Rent Controller for more than a decade. There is no ground to interfere in revisional jurisdiction of this court. Dismissed. May 09, 2013 (RAJAN GUPTA) Ajay JUDGE",

    "case_id": "Criminal Revision was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation to impugn the judgment dated 27.2.1996 rendered by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur. Complaint under Section 85(g) of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 ( hereinafter referred to as the Act ) was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation through its Insurance Inspector/ Manager, Local Office, Dhariwal, on the allegations that accused Rakesh Kumar Ohri (Proprietor) was and continued to be the Principal Employer of M/S. Raman & Company (Rice Mill), Awankhe Gate, near D.A.V.School, Dina Nagar in terms of Section 2(17) of the Act and at the time of committing of offence was in-charge and was responsible to the establishment for the superannuating of control of the business of the establishment. The accused has failed to produce the record, namely, wages/salaries registers, contribution registers, return of contributions, registers of employees' under Regulation 32 and other record pertaining to the payment of contributions, Inspection book, payment vouchers and ledgers and cash books for inspection before Insurance Inspector on 10.8.1993 and 22.9.1993 for the period from 1.7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Due to non- production of the record as mentioned above, accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Accused was summoned to face trial. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued. Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Accused moved an application dated 11.2.1995 for dropping the proceedings on the allegation that complaint was instituted after the expiry of period of limitation, as per Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. Notice was issued to the complainant. Ultimately, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, opined that complaint is not maintainable being time barred and was dismissed. Feeling dissatisfied with the order dated 27.2.1996 this revision petition was instituted. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the revisionist argued that main complaint was presented on 10.11.1993. After summoning, accused had appeared on 23.11.1994. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued on 5.1.1995. Under the Act, no limitation is provided. Maximum sentence under Section 85(g) of the Act is two years and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-. Contribution is every month. Due to non-deposit of contribution offence under Sectilon 85(g) is a continuing offence. Learned counsel for the revisionist cited ESIC Vs. C.C.Santhakumar, JT 2006(10) SC 549. Learned counsel for the respondent argued that as per Section 468 Cr.P.C. complaint was not within limitation. Court has no power to take cognizance beyond the expiry of limitation. Due to non-production of record, complaint should have been filed within six months. As per the Act, question of limitation can be agitated at any stage even after cognizance is taken. In the present case, cognizance was taken on 5.1.1995 when notice was issued. As per allegation of the revisionist, respondent failed to produce record pertaining to the payment of contributions, inspection book, payment vouchers, ledgers and cash book etc for investigation for the period from .7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Complaint was presented in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur on .11.1993. Notice was issued to the accused to appear in the Court. After appearance of the accused, on 23.11.1994, notice under Section 85(g) was issued on 5.1.1995. Record is silent as to on which date application for dropping proceedings under Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. were presented. Due to non-production of record, accused are liable for the commission of offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Section 85(g) of the Act is reproduced as under:- (g) is guilty of any contravention of or non- compliance with any of the requirements of this Act or the rules or the regulations in respect of which no special penalty is provided. ( he shall be punishable (i) where the commits an offence under clause (a), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years but- (a) which shall not be less than one year, in case of failure to pay the employee s contribution which has been deducted by him from the employee s wages and shall also be liable to fine of ten thousand rupees; (b) which shall not be less than six months, in any other case and shall also be liable to fine of five thousand rupees. Provided that the Court may, or any adequate and special reason to be recorded in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a lesser term. (ii) where he commits an offence under any of the clauses (b) to (g) (both inclusive), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to four thousand rupees, or with both.) In E.S.I.C. v. C.C. Santhakumar, JT 2006 (10) SC , the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:- 21. It is clear, therefore, that the right of the Corporation to recover these amounts by coercive process is not restricted by any limitation nor could be the Government by recourse to the rule-making power prescribed a period in the teeth of Section 68. . In the above judgment this Court has clearly held that Section 68 of the Act empowers the Corporation to resort to coercive process, to recover the contribution from the employer as if it were an arrear of land revenue and the said right is not restricted by any limitation. This is a crucial Section. . Similarly, no limitation is provided in Chapter VII. It deals with the imposition of penalty or levy of damages upon failure to pay contributions. It consists of Sections 84 to 86A. . When the Act itself does not provide for any limitation on the Corporation right to claim, the employers cannot rely upon Regulations 32 to , dealing with the period for maintenance of registers, to imply any limitation. Gurdeep Singh Vs. State and others, (3) 289 was relied by the learned trial Court for disposing of the application for dropping proceedings wherein it was held that: A. Delhi Police Act, 1978, Sections 93 and and 2 ( r)- Altercation took place inside the house No offence under Section 93 made out- Offence under Section 93 is made out if accused used any street or public place for threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intend to provoke breach of peace.

The prosecution case is that on 9-5-1993 at about 11-00 a.m. in the area of bus stand Katani Kalan, the petitioner was driving Bus No. CH-01G-5061 and due to his rash and negligent driving, while attempting to overtake a tempo, it ran over the same and hit an electric pole and thereafter ran over one Maghi Ram, who was standing on left side of the road, as a result of which the latter died. The petitioner was convicted by the Judicial Magistrate st Class, Ludhiana and sentenced to RI for one year under Section -A IPC and a fine of Rs. 2,000/- and six months' RI under Section IPC. It was further ordered that non-payment of fine will entail him with three months' RI. All the sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The petitioner filed appeal, which was also dismissed by learned Additional Sessions Judge, Ludhiana. Hence he has come up in the present revision petition. Sh. Nitin Kumar appearing for the petitioner has very fairly stated that since the witnesses have been believed by both the Courts below and they have returned the findings of fact, it would be difficult for him to dislodge the testimony of the witnesses before a revisional court. Criminal Revision No. 407 of 1998 (2) Making an alternative prayer for reduction of sentence, Mr. Nitin Kumar submits that the occurrence took place in May 1993. A period of 15 years has elapsed. The petitioner has suffered a protracted trial. He was taken into custody on 18-4-1998 and was enlarged on bail on 20-5-1998 i.e. he has undergone one month and two days. Taking into consideration the totality of circumstances, I find no justification in sending the petitioner behind bars once again after 15 years. The sentence awarded by the trial Court is reduced to the period already undergone by the petitioner, subject to payment of fine of Rs.25,000/-, which ( if realised) shall be disbursed to the legal heirs of deceased Maghi Ram. The amount of fine shall be deposited before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ludhiana within three months from today. In case of failure to deposit the amount of fine, the present revision shall be deemed to have been dismissed and the petitioner shall undergo the remnant sentence, as awarded by the trial Court. With the aforesaid modification in the sentence, the revision petition stands disposed of.",

JUSTICE HEMANT GUPTA HON BLE MR. JUSTICE JASWANT SINGH Present: - None for the petitioner Mr. A.P.S. Maan, Addl. AG. Punjab for respondent HEMANT GUPTA, J The petitioner is a dealer under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act, 1948 and also under Central Sales Tax Act, . The petitioner sold cotton seed oil which is claimed by the petitioner as edible oil fit for human consumption and on which sales tax @ 1% is leviable in terms of notification dated .1.1979. Such claim of the petitioner was not accepted by the Assessing Authority, Bathinda in its order dated 25.1.1990. It was found that the Central Sales Tax on inter state sales of cotton seed oil other than edible oil fit for human consumption is 4% against C forms whereas the petitioner has deposited only 1%. The assessment was framed accordingly. The issue raised in the present petition was also raised in CWP No. 6919 of 1987. The said writ petition was allowed on 18.7.1991 by the learned Single Bench of this Court. But Letter Patent Appeal against the said judgment was accepted by the Division Bench of this Court vide the judgment CWP No. 11761 of 1989 reported as (1998) 118 PLR 103 State of Punjab and ors vs. Milkhi Ram Oil and Dall Mills decided on 21.8.1997. It has been held that the cotton seed oil is not edible oil in the hands of dealer. Thus, the issue whether the cotton seed oil is not edible oil stands concluded in the case of Milkhi Ram Oil (supra). In view of the said decision, present petition is dismissed for the reasons recorded in the case of Milkhi Ram Oil (supra). (HEMANT GUPTA) JUDGE .9.2011 (JASWANT SINGH) preeti JUDGE",

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mr. Atul Lakhanpal, Senior Advocate with Mr. Surinder Batra, Advocate for the appellant. Mr. Deepak Jindal, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana for the State. Mr. Sudhir Sharma, Advocate for the complainant. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. In the present case accused had fired shot from a country- made pistol, which had hit knee of Balwan. The accused made a disclosure statement and got recovered the country-made pistol. Amar Singh appeared as PW-2 and supported the version given by ASI Dharamvir PW-3. In pursuance of the disclosure statement made, pistol Ex.P1 and empties Ex.P2 to P4 were recovered on 8th March, 1995. The trial Court had convicted the appellant for offence under Section 25 of the Arms Act and had sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years. It was further ordered that the sentence shall run concurrent with the sentence awarded to the accused under Section 307 IPC. This Court had separately decided Criminal Appeal No.554- SB of 1997, wherein it was held that accused had fired shot at Balwan and had caused an injury which fall under Section 308 IPC and has Criminal Appeal No.557-SB of 1997 sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years. The testimony of Amar Singh PW-2 and ASI Dharamvir PW-3 has been relied in the case under Section 308 IPC, where Amar Singh had appeared as PW-12 and ASI Dharamvir had appeared as PW-15. Therefore, once recovery of weapon in pursuance of disclosure statement has been proved and it has been held by the Court that fire arm was used to cause injury, there is no justification to substitute the well reasoned judgment of the trial Court. However, as the trial Court had stated that the sentence awarded under Section 25 of the Arms Act shall run concurrent with the sentence awarded under Section 307 IPC, this Court acting as an appellate Court also affirms this finding and orders that sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment awarded to the appellant under Section 25 of the Arms Act shall run concurrent with the sentence of three years rigorous imprisonment awarded to him under Section 308 IPC. With the observations made above, present appeal is disposed of. [KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA] JUDGE th January, 2010 rps",

The said writ petition has been disposed of on 13.1.1994 where the Court has held that Corporation was bound to make allotment of industrial plots to the petitioners as per the terms and conditions mentioned in the letters of allotment. The Bench has also given the liberty to the Corporation to claim additional price in the plot on account of enhancement of compensation under the Land Acquisition Act. The review is sought on the basis that he was not a party to the writ petition. The cancellation of allotment of plots had a direct bearing to his own right, he being an allottee. The petitioner cannot any longer be aggrieved since through the decision of CWP No. of 1987 the Court has held that the cancellation of allotment would be ineffective and has directed the allotment. . The review application is disposed of as unnecessary in view of the judgment quashing the order of cancellation of allotment in CWP No. 8486 of 1990.

    "court": "In the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh Date of decision: 1.9.2008 Labha and another ......Appellants Versus State of Punjab .......Respondent CORAM: HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE JASBIR SINGH HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE SABINA Present: Ms.G.K.Mann, Advocate, for the appellants. Mr.Rajesh Bhardwaj, DAG, Punjab. **** JUDGMENT SABINA, J. Labha and Kuldip Singh @ Keepa have filed this appeal challenging their conviction and sentence under Section 302/34/450 IPC vide impugned judgment dated 11.9.1998 passed by Sessions Judge, Amrisar. Prosecution story, in brief, is that on 24.7.1996 the complainant took his dinner along with his father Jiwan Dass, younger brother Surinder Kumar and cousin brother Rajinder Mohan. Thereafter, the complainant along with Surinder Kumar and Rajinder Mohan slept on the cots on the roof of the rooms, whereas, Jiwan Dass slept on a cot on the roof of the varandah, opposite to them. An electric bulb was on in the courtyard. About 10.30/11.00 p.m. complainant woke up on hearing alram raised by his father and saw that Labha armed with datar was giving blows on the face of his father while he was sleeping. Kuldip Singh @ Keepa was empty handed and had held Jiwan Dass from his legs. Complainant raised hue and cry which woke up Surinder Kumar and Rajinder Mohan. Labha gave 4-5 datar blows on the face of Jiwan Dass. When they raised alarm accused fled away from the spot with their weapon. Motive behind occurrence is that accused used to purchase goods from their shop on credit and they had been abused by Jiwan Dass on account of some payment. Due to this reason they had murdered him in connivance with each other. Out of fear and trauma, complainant did not report the matter to the police during night. The matter was reported to the police in the morning and statement of complainant was recorded at about 9.00 a.m. on 25.7.1996. On the basis of the statement of the complainant formal FIR No. 116 dated .7.1996 was registered by the police of police station Lopoke. Inspector Gurbhinder Singh visited the spot along with the complainant. The dead body of Jiwan Dass was recovered from the cot on the roof of the veranda. He prepared inquest report with regard to the recovered dead body and lifted blood stained earth from the spot and recorded statements of the witnesses. Rough site plan was prepared and the dead body was sent for post mortem examination. Dr. Ashok Chanana conducted the post mortem examination on the dead body of Jiwan Dass on 26.7.1996 at about .00 a.m. and found following injuries on the person of the deceased:- . A horizontal incised wound 6 x 1.5 cm with clotted blood was present on the front of the nose in its middle. The nose was divided into two portions. Clotted blood was present at the site. . A horizontal incised wound 7 x 1.4 cm with clotted blood was present on the face, 3 cm below injury No.1. . An incised wound 1.6 x 2 cm was present from the right cheek upto the left ear. It passed through the upper lip. Clotted blood was present at the site. The mouth contained 50 ml. of fluid and clotted blood. . An incised wound obliquely placed 7x 1.4 cm with clotted blood was present on the left mandibular region. The underlying mandible was fractured. Clotted blood was present at the site. . An incised wound obliquely placed 3 x 1.2 cm with clotted blood was present on the back of left middle finger. He further opined that injuries were ante mortem in nature and cause of death was shock as a result of cumulative effect of injuries which were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. The time between injuries and death was rapid and between death and postmortem examination was about 24 to 36 hours. Accused were arrested on 2.8.1996. During interrogation of accused Labha on 4.8.1996 blood stained datar was got recovered on the basis of his disclosure statement. After completion of investigation and necessary formalities accused were sent up for trial. Charge was framed against them under Section 302/34 and IPC on 30.4.1997 to which they did not plead guilty and claimed trial. At the trial, prosecution in order to prove its case examined Dr.Ashok Chanana (PW-1), Narinder Kumar (PW-2), Rajinder Mohan (PW-3) and Gurbhinder Singh ( PW-4). After the close of prosecution evidence accused, when examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C., prayed that they were innocent and have been falsely involved in this case. Learned trial Judge, Amritsar believed the prosecution version and held the accused guilty of the charge framed against them. Accused Labha was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.1,000/- under Section 302 IPC and rigorous imprisonment for three years with fine of Rs.500/- under Section 450 IPC. Accused Kuldip Singh @ Keepa was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.1,000/- under Section 302/34 IPC and rigorous imprisonment for three years with fine of Rs.500/- under Section 450 IPC. Hence, the present appeal. In appeal, it has been argued that it was a case of blind murder and the appellants had been falsely involved in this case. The presence of five witnesses at the spot was doubtful. There was inordinate delay in lodging the FIR, which made the prosecution case untrustworthy. The names of the eye witnesses were not mentioned in the inquest report nor the weapon used was described therein. Learned State counsel, on the other hand, has submitted that the presence of the complainant could not be doubted at the spot being son of the deceased. The presence of the remaining witnesses can also not be doubted at the spot. There was no unexplained delay in lodging the FIR. Present case rests on an eye witness account. Complainant is the son of the deceased and his presence in the house i.e. place of occurrence cannot be doubted. Rajinder Mohan (PW-3) is the cousin brother of the complainant and his presence at the spot also cannot be doubted. Complainant, while appearing in witness box as PW-2, has deposed as per his statement in the FIR, which is duly corroborated by Rajinder Mohan (PW-3). Complainant woke up on hearing alarm raised by his father, whereas, Rajinder Mohan (PW-3) woke up on alarm raised by the complainant. Both the said witnesses witnessed the occurrence. The occurrence had allegedly taken place at about 10.30/11.00 a.m. and the matter was reported to the police in the morning. As per the Investigating Officer, the complainant had met him at about 7.30 a.m. on .7.1996 and, thereafter, he recorded his statement. After recording of the FIR, the special report was immediately sent to the Magistrate, which was received by him at 11.15 a.m. The complainant must have been in a trauma and panic when he saw his father being murdered. Apparently it took some time for the complainant to report the matter to the police regarding murder of his father. The complainant has explained the delay that out of fear they did not move out anywhere at night and next day he along with Surjit Singh, Sarpanch of the village left to lodge the FIR. At this stage, it would be significant to examine the site plan Exhibit PJ. A perusal of the same reveals that dead body of Jiwan Dass was lying on a cot at Mark 'A' on the veranda, whereas, the complainant and eye witnesses were sleeping on the roof of the rooms opposite the veranda. An electric bulb was on at point 'E' near the place where the complainant and eye witnesses were sleeping. There is another aspect also. The complainant in his cross- examination deposed that roof of the house, where they were sleeping, could be 12 ft. high from the ground, whereas, roof of the house where his father was sleeping might be 9 ft. high. This appears plausible because generally roof of rooms is at a higher level than that of veranda A perusal of the site plan Ex. PJ as well as from the cross-examination of complainant it transpires that the occurrence could be witnessed by the eye witnesses from the place where they were sleeping and immediately it may not have been possible for them to rescue Jiwan Dass. It strengthens the prosecution case that the witnesses were present at the spot and had witnessed the occurrence. The moment all the eye witnesses woke up and raised alarm, accused fled away from the spot. Admittedly, Jiwan Dass was sleeping at the time of occurrence. Injuries have been inflicted by accused Labha with the knife (datar) on the face of the deceased. The ocular version in this regard is duly corroborated by the medical evidence. Since the deceased was sleeping when the occurrence took place, he could not have offerred any resistance at that time and, as such, it was not necessary for any person to have held him from his legs. Rather this would have woken up the deceased before he was attacked. Apparently, the possibility that accused Kuldip Singh @ Keepa has been falsely involved in this case cannot be ruled out. Especially when there was no occasion for him to restrain a sleeping man. His presence at the spot is doubtful. However, so far as accused Labha is concerned, the statements of the witnesses qua his infliction of injuries on the person of the deceased are reliable and inspire confidence. The weapon used by accused Labha was recovered on the basis of his disclosure statement. As per the report of serologist knife was found to be stained with human blood. The fact that the names of the eye witnesses are not mentioned in the inquest report Exhibit PC is not material as Surjit Singh, Ex-Sarpanch and Samma Singh had merely identified the dead body, as per column No.4. It was not necessary for the Investigating Officer to have mentioned the names of all the other persons in the said column. Moreover, the inquest report was prepared after the statement of the complainant was recorded, who had duly named the assailants in his statement. As such, the fact that dead body was not identified by the PWs' is not significant. In column No.12 of the inquest report it had been mentioned that the injuries had been caused with a sharp edged weapon. Merely because this weapon had not been specifically named in the said column does not damage the case of the prosecution which is otherwise duly established from the ocular and medical version qua appellant Labha. Even otherwise it is a settled law that any lapse committed by the Investigating Officer cannot be said to be fatal to the prosecution case if otherwise established. Although complainant has spelt out motive to commit the crime by the accused but in a case of eye witnesses account, motive looses its significance. After going through the entire evidence on record, we are of the opinion that the prosecution has been successful in proving its case against appellant Labha and his conviction and sentence are liable to be upheld. So far as appellant Kuldip Singh @ Keepa is concerned, he is liable to be acquitted by giving him benefit of doubt as possibility of his having been falsely involved in this case cannot be ruled out. Accordingly, this appeal is partly allowed. Appeal qua appellant No.1 Labha is dismissed and his conviction and sentence under Section 302 and 450 IPC is maintained. Appeal qua appellant No.2 Kuldip Singh @ Keepa is allowed and he is acquitted of the charge framed against him. (SABINA)",

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate for the appellant. Ms. Hemlata Balhara, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana for the State. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. Taqdir Singh son of Lehri Singh has preferred the present appeal and has challenged the judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 30th July, 1998, whereby he was held guilty of offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The trial Court had sentenced the appellant under Section 452 IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant was further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1 years under Section 376 IPC. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 of Police Station Sahlawas was present at Jhajjar, when the prosecutrix PW-1 (whose name has been withheld to protect her identity) along with her husband Nahnu Ram PW-5 appeared and made statement Ex.PA, on the basis of which FIR No.32 dated .05.1996 was registered at Police Station Sahlawas. The prosecutrix stated that her parents belong to Dadri Toe. About 11 months before the occurrence, she was married with Nahnu Ram. She was staying in her matrimonial home at village Chandol. She had set up a separate residence with her husband three months before the occurrence and her in-laws were residing in another house. On 3rd May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m. her husband had gone to village Bhakli to do the work of Halwai (sweet maker) in a marriage and she was alone at her house. At about .00 p.m., she went to sleep in the courtyard after bolting the door of her house. She had retired to her bed after taking her meals. At about 11.00 p.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time, the present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had gagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear only. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her mouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied both of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in both the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were broken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide resistance. The accused had broken the string of Salwar of the prosecutrix, removed her panty and forcibly committed sexual intercourse upon her. After the occurrence, the accused untied the hands of the prosecutrix, removed the cloth from her face and ran away from the spot. In the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in- law Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was sent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm to her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house, since the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of the people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant along with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police. She was going to the Police Station to lodge the report when the police officials met her and she got her statement recorded. It was further stated that Taqdir had left his house from the day of incident and was not available. In the present case, occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, at about 11.00 p.m. The prosecutrix had made statement Ex.PA to ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 on 7th May, 1996 at 1.20 p.m. Case was registered at Police Station Sahlawas on 7th May, 1996 at 3.30 p.m. The above said FIR was investigated and report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted against the accused appellant. The case, along with the accused, was committed to the Court of Sessions Judge, Rohtak and was entrusted for trial to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Rohtak. On 19th September, 1996, the trial Judge charged the appellant for offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The charge stated that on 3rd May, 1996 at about 11.00 p.m. in the area of village Chandol, the appellant committed house-trespass by entering the house of the prosecutrix, used as human dwelling, having made preparation to wrongfully restrain the prosecutrix and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 452 IPC. It was further stated that on the same day, time and place, he had committed offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecutrix appeared as PW-1 and reiterated as to what was stated in her statement Ex.PA, contents of which have been noticed above. She further sated that Taqdir was her neighbour. In cross examination, this witness admitted that her mother had got a case registered against Hari Singh and Smt. Bala wife of Hari Singh on the accusation that Hari Singh had given a kick blow in the stomach of mother of the prosecutrix, due to which she got aborted and the child died. She denied the suggestion that earlier her mother had compromised the matter after acceptance of money. This witness further stated that when the accused appeared near her cot, he was having a 5 feet long Parna (cloth) in his hand. She further stated that the elder brother of her husband was sent to relay the information to her husband. She further deposed that due to breakage of her bangles at the time of incident, she had sustained injuries on her arm s skin but the injuries did not bleed. It was stated that her underwear and Salwar were stained with semen. The police had taken into possession the broken bangles, ring and clothes from the house of prosecutrix. She denied the suggestion that she had lodged false case against the accused to save Bansi son of Sube, a driver and accused in a case under Section 377 IPC. Bansi is stated to be Ustad (teacher) of husband of the prosecutrix as he allegedly used to impart lessons to him in driving. She further stated that it was not in her knowledge that Bansi was named as accused for having committed unnatural intercourse with son of the accused.

    "court": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH Criminal Appeal No. 691-SB of 1998 Date of decision: 23rd February, 2010 Taqdir Singh Appellant Versus State of Haryana Respondent CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate for the appellant. Ms. Hemlata Balhara, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana for the State. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. Taqdir Singh son of Lehri Singh has preferred the present appeal and has challenged the judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 30th July, 1998, whereby he was held guilty of offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The trial Court had sentenced the appellant under Section 452 IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant was further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1 years under Section 376 IPC. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 of Police Station Sahlawas was present at Jhajjar, when the prosecutrix PW-1 (whose name has been withheld to protect her identity) along with her husband Nahnu Ram PW-5 appeared and made statement Ex.PA, on the basis of which FIR No.32 dated .05.1996 was registered at Police Station Sahlawas. The prosecutrix stated that her parents belong to Dadri Toe. About 11 months before the occurrence, she was married with Nahnu Ram. She was staying in her matrimonial home at village Chandol. She had set up a separate residence with her husband three months before the occurrence and her in-laws were residing in another house. On 3rd May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m. her husband had gone to village Bhakli to do the work of Halwai (sweet maker) in a marriage and she was alone at her house. At about .00 p.m., she went to sleep in the courtyard after bolting the door of her house. She had retired to her bed after taking her meals. At about 11.00 p.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time, the present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had gagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear only. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her mouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied both of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in both the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were broken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide resistance. The accused had broken the string of Salwar of the prosecutrix, removed her panty and forcibly committed sexual intercourse upon her. After the occurrence, the accused untied the hands of the prosecutrix, removed the cloth from her face and ran away from the spot. In the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in- law Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was sent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm to her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house, since the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of the people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant along with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police. She was going to the Police Station to lodge the report when the police officials met her and she got her statement recorded. It was further stated that Taqdir had left his house from the day of incident and was not available. In the present case, occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, at about 11.00 p.m. The prosecutrix had made statement Ex.PA to ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 on 7th May, 1996 at 1.20 p.m. Case was registered at Police Station Sahlawas on 7th May, 1996 at 3.30 p.m. The above said FIR was investigated and report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted against the accused appellant. The case, along with the accused, was committed to the Court of Sessions Judge, Rohtak and was entrusted for trial to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Rohtak. On 19th September, 1996, the trial Judge charged the appellant for offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The charge stated that on 3rd May, 1996 at about 11.00 p.m. in the area of village Chandol, the appellant committed house-trespass by entering the house of the prosecutrix, used as human dwelling, having made preparation to wrongfully restrain the prosecutrix and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 452 IPC. It was further stated that on the same day, time and place, he had committed offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecutrix appeared as PW-1 and reiterated as to what was stated in her statement Ex.PA, contents of which have been noticed above. She further sated that Taqdir was her neighbour. In cross examination, this witness admitted that her mother had got a case registered against Hari Singh and Smt. Bala wife of Hari Singh on the accusation that Hari Singh had given a kick blow in the stomach of mother of the prosecutrix, due to which she got aborted and the child died. She denied the suggestion that earlier her mother had compromised the matter after acceptance of money. This witness further stated that when the accused appeared near her cot, he was having a 5 feet long Parna (cloth) in his hand. She further stated that the elder brother of her husband was sent to relay the information to her husband. She further deposed that due to breakage of her bangles at the time of incident, she had sustained injuries on her arm s skin but the injuries did not bleed. It was stated that her underwear and Salwar were stained with semen. The police had taken into possession the broken bangles, ring and clothes from the house of prosecutrix. She denied the suggestion that she had lodged false case against the accused to save Bansi son of Sube, a driver and accused in a case under Section 377 IPC. Bansi is stated to be Ustad (teacher) of husband of the prosecutrix as he allegedly used to impart lessons to him in driving. She further stated that it was not in her knowledge that Bansi was named as accused for having committed unnatural intercourse with son of the accused. Head Constable Bharat Singh PW-2, Constable Nafe Singh PW-3 and Constable Krishan Kumar PW-4 tendered their affidavits Ex.PB, PC and PD respectively to prove link evidence. Nahnu Ram, husband of the prosecutrix appeared as PW-5. He stated that on 3rd May, 1996, he had gone to village Bhakli to do the job of Halwai (sweet maker). On 4th May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m., he received the information through his cousin Ram Kishan and came back to his house at 6.30 p.m. He divulged the occurrence to the Sarpanch and other respectables of the village and on their advice that the culprit should be punished, he along with his wife proceeded to the Police Station, when on the way police party met him and his wife got recorded the statement to the police. In cross examination, this witness stated that the broken bangles were put in a match box by a Sub Inspector. He admitted that his father and the father of accused Taqdir were real brothers. Dr.Aruna Sangwan, Medical Officer, Community Health Centre, Jhajjar PW-6 medico legally examined the prosecutrix on 7th May, at 3.45 p.m. No external mark of injury was found, except that there was an old fracture on the right thigh with shortening. In examination of external organs, a whitish discharge was found present in the vagina. Old tags of hymen were present. Vagina admitted two fingers. Vaginal swabs from posterior fornix were taken. Sample of the pubic hair of the prosecutrix was also taken. This witness stated that since the prosecutrix had changed her clothes, they were not taken into possession. This witness had not ruled out the possibility of prosecutrix having sexual intercourse. In cross examination, this witness stated that there was no external mark of injury on the body of the prosecutrix and there was no semen mark on her thigh. SI Jagdish Chander PW-7 had prepared the report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. ASI Sumer Singh PW-8 proved registration of the formal FIR Ex.PA/1 on receipt of ruqa Ex.PA. Dr.Ram Kumar, Medical Officer PW-9 had examined the accused appellant and had opined that there was nothing to suggest that the accused was not fit to perform sexual intercourse. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 was the Investigating Officer. He deposed regarding various facets of the investigation. This witness further stated that on 13th May, 1996, he had arrested the accused. This witness stated that when he had inspected the spot, he had not found any broken bangles. This witness admitted that the house of the accused and the door of house of the prosecutrix open in the same street. He stated that the boundary wall between the houses of the accused and that of the prosecutrix was having a height of three feet. Sunil Kumar Bhatnagar, Draftsman PW-11 had prepared the scaled site plan of the spot Ex.PO. Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix was given up as won-over. The Public Prosecutor had placed on record report Ex.PK of the Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban, Haryana, wherein it was stated that human semen was detected on multicoloured terrycot Salwar and on yellow/brown nylon underwear. Thereafter, prosecution closed its evidence. Statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating circumstances were put to him. He denied the same and projected the following version in his statement: Yes. I am innocent. I have been falsely implicated in this case only to save Bansi s/o Sube Singh who is friend and Guru of the husband of the prosecutrix in motor driving, as there was case against him under Section 377 IPC and in charge of P.S. Sahalwas Jagdish Chander was relative of my village and interested in compromise in the case under Section 377 IPC. Both parties were apprehended from the village on the same day but they were sent to home in evening and I was kept in Thana more than 5 and 6 days. In defence, Jagminder Singh Draftsman was examined as DW-1. He proved the site plan Ex.D1. This witness stated that the door of the house of accused faces the street towards the Northern side of his house. Thereafter, there is a small turning at the northern-western corner of the house of accused and thereafter, the street goes to the door of the house of prosecutrix. Mauji Ram DW-2 stated that as a Sarpanch, he had not heard of any incident. This witness stated that it was not in his knowledge that the accused and cousin of Nahnu Ram were challaned under Section /151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had only heard about a family dispute. Het Ram DW-3 stated that he had learnt that Taqdir had been challaned under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had heard nothing about the accused. In cross examination, this witness stated that there was no case registered against the accused under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. Sabha Chand Chaukidar DW-4 stated that the circumstances regarding arrest of the accused were not in his knowledge. I have heard counsel for the parties. Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate appearing for the appellant, has stated that the prosecutrix was aged about 19-20 years. It is further submitted that at the time of incident, prosecutrix was 21 weeks pregnant. It is submitted that according to the prosecution story, accused came to the house of the prosecutrix at 11.00 p.m. He had tied the hands of the prosecutrix with a cloth and had allegedly gagged her mouth with the cloth. It is contended that according to the prosecutrix, the accused while leaving, had untied her hands and had removed the cloth from her mouth, still the prosecutrix had raised no noise to attract anybody and narrate the incident. These circumstances according to the counsel, make the version projected by the prosecutrix unnatural, improbable and unconvincing. It is urged that this Court should appreciate the arguments in light of the fact that for four days, the prosecutrix had not reported the matter to the police. The occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, 1996, whereas, the report was lodged with the police on 7th May, 1996. Counsel has further stated that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles and ring of little finger were broken at the spot and the same were taken into possession by the Investigating Officer. This fact was also reiterated by Nahna Ram PW-5, husband of the prosecutrix. But ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 had stated in categoric terms that no bangles were taken into possession and the same were not found at the spot. This according to the counsel, is a material contradiction between the testimony of three prime witnesses examined by the prosecution. Furthermore, it was averred that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles had caused injuries on her arms but no such injury was found in the medico legal report, therefore, the medical evidence in no way corroborates the ocular version. It is submitted that vaginal swabs were sent to the laboratory but no semen was found. There were no external or internal marks of injury suffered by the prosecutrix. It is further submitted that Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, to whom the occurrence was narrated for the first time, was not examined by the prosecution. Even brother of husband of the prosecutrix, who had relayed the information to Nahnu Ram, husband of the prosecutrix, at the place of his avocation, was not examined. Adding force to the above stated arguments, it is urged that the suggestions given by the accused and the version narrated by him in his statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. assumes importance, as present and the former Sarpanch of the village had appeared in defence as DW-2 and DW-3 respectively and stated that no occurrence had taken place. This according to the counsel, belies the explanation furnished by the prosecutrix to explain the delay that the villagers had prompted her to lodge the report so that the culprit should be punished. Counsel for the State has urged that the testimony of prosecutrix aspires confidence and can be relied upon without any corroboration. There are certain features of this case, which compel this Court to arrive at a conclusion that the testimony of the prosecutrix can be relied upon without any corroboration: (a) Father of the accused and the father of husband of the prosecutrix were brothers, therefore, the accused and husband of the prosecutrix are closely related. (b) On the day of occurrence, in connection with his avocation, husband of the prosecutrix had gone out of the village and the prosecutrix was alone at her house when in the night accused had trespassed into her house. (c) The version projected regarding the alleged inimical relations has not been proved by the defence. No copy of the FIR, report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. or the Court proceedings has been placed on record to prove that the alleged friend (Ustad) of husband of the prosecutrix was involved in a case under Section 377 Cr.P.C. Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that the prosecutrix and her husband will level false allegations of rape to absolve a friend of the husband, especially when the accused is closely related to them. Thus, except a bald suggestion and a version under Section Cr.P.C., nothing has been brought on record to corroborate the same. The suggestion propounded by the defence and the version given under Section 313 Cr.P.C. are to be rejected, being not probable. Once this Court has held that the relations between the parties were normal, then it is difficult to believe that the prosecutrix will put reputation of her family at stake by leveling false allegations. (d) It is not the case of the accused that it is a case of consent. The arguments raised by the defence counsel that there was a delay of four days in lodging the report to the police; no injury on the person of the prosecutrix was found in the medical evidence, therefore, she had not offered any resistance; the bangles were not recovered and that the defence witnesses have belied the version of the prosecutrix, are to be rejected in the context of circumstances enumerated above. The Hon ble Apex Court, in State of Maharasthra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550, observed as under: 15. It is necessary at the outset to state what the approach of the court should be while evaluating the prosecution evidence, particularly the evidence of the prosecutrix, in sex offences. Is it essential that the evidence of the prosecutrix should be corroborated in material particulars before the court bases a conviction on her testimony ? Does the rule of prudence demand that in all cases save the rarest of rare the court should look for corroboration before acting on the evidence of the prosecutrix ? Let us see if the Evidence Act provides the clue. Under the said statute Evidence means and includes all statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to the matters of fact under inquiry. Under Section 59 all facts, except the contents of documents, may be proved by oral evidence. Section 118 then tells us who may give oral evidence. According to that section all persons are competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rational answers to those questions, by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind. Even in the case of an accomplice Section provides that he shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. However, illustration (b) to Section 114, which lays down a rule of practice, says that the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is corroborated in material particulars. Thus under Section 133, which lays down a rule of law, an accomplice is a competent witness and a conviction based solely on his uncorroborated evidence is not illegal although in view of Section 114, illustration (b), courts do not as a matter of practice do so and look for corroboration in material particulars. This is the conjoint effect of Sections 133 and 114, illustration (b). . A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to illustration (b) to Section 114 which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no doubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix who does not lack understanding must be accepted. The degree of proof required must not be higher than is expected of an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that exception has rightly been taken to the approach of the High Court as is reflected in the following passage: It is only in the rarest of rare cases if the court finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is so trustworthy, truthful and reliable that other corroboration may not be necessary. With respect, the law is not correctly stated. If we may say so, it is just the reverse. Ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an injured person who is a victim of violence, unless there are special circumstances which call for greater caution, in which case it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is independent evidence lending assurance to her accusation. . We think it proper, having regard to the increase in the number of sex violation cases in the recent past, particularly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to remove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman who is a victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be corroborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare cases. To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare cases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust of another with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult womanhood. It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman that her story of woe will not be believed unless it is corroborated in material particulars as in the case of an accomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where it concerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society as in some of the western and European countries. Our standard of decency and morality in public life is not the same as in those countries. It is, however, unfortunate that respect for womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases of molestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman is now required to suffer indignities in different forms, from lewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape. Decency and morality in public life can be promoted and protected only if we deal strictly with those who violate the societal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the court in such cases must take into account the fact that such crimes are generally committed on the sly and very rarely direct evidence of a person other than the prosecutrix is available. Courts must also realise that ordinarily a woman, more so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling a false charge concerning her chastity. In the light of the observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court above, this Court cannot ignore that on the Salwar and underwear of the prosecutrix, human semen was detected. It is not necessary that in every case, vaginal swabs must contain semen. Sometimes the accused may discharge the semen outside the vagina. No question to this effect was asked to the prosecutrix. Furthermore, it was stated by the prosecutrix that her hands were tied and her legs were weak, therefore, she could not offer resistance to the accused, who was a well built young man. Non- examination of Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, and elder brother (cousin) (Jeth) of husband of the prosecutrix, is also of no consequence as the testimony of the prosecutrix corroborated by her husband is sufficient for reliance, as the same aspires confidence. In Gita Ram v. State of H.P. 2002 Cri.L.J.3832, Himachal Pradesh High Court has held that the delay in lodging of the report is of no consequence as victim of sexual assault face a lot of difficulty to come forward to depose against the accused, as the reputation of family of the prosecutrix is at stake. Relying upon the judgment rendered in State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh (1996) 2 SCC 384, Himachal Pradesh High Court observed as under: 22. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh , (1996) 2 SCC : (1996 Cri LJ 1728), their Lordships took note of the existing rate of crime against women and held : (SCC p 403, para 21) : (at Pp 1739-40, Para 20 of Cri LJ). 21. Of late, crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the society towards the violation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must remember that a rapist not only violate the victim's privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female. The Courts, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If for some reason the Court finds it different to place implicit reliance on her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the trial Court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations. Referring to an earlier judgment in State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550 : (1990 Cri LJ 889), the Supreme Court in Gurmit Singh case (1996 (2) SCC 384 : 1996 Cri LJ 1728) held : (SCC Pp 395- , paras 8-9) : (at p 1735, Para 7 of Cri LJ). The Courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self respecting woman would come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. The inherent bashfulness of the females and the tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are factors which the Courts should not overlook. The testimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the Courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion ? The Court while appreciating the evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is a witness who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to insist upon corroboration of her statement to base conviction of an accused. The evidence of a victim of sexual assault stands almost on a par with the evidence of a injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable. Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which is not found to be self inflicted, as considered to be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield the real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding. Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. It must not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person s lust and it is improper and undesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount of suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice. Interference have to be drawn from a given set of facts and circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead uniformity lest that type of rigidity in the shape of rule of law is introduced through a new form of testimonial tyranny making justice a casualty. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even, if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as deprobable. In State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990 (1) SCC 550 : 1990 Cri LJ 889), Ahmadi, J. (as the Lord Chief Justice then was) speaking for the Bench summarised the position in the following words : (SCC p 559, para 16 : (at Pp 894-95, Para 16 of Cri LJ). A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on a par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care of and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to Illustration (b) to Section 114 which required it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the Court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the Court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the Court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We are in respectful agreement with the above exposition of law. In the instant case our careful analysis of the statement of the prosecutrix has created an impression on our minds that she is a reliable and truthful witness. Her testimony suffers from no infirmity or blemish whatsoever. We have no hesitation in acting upon her testimony alone without looking for any corroboration. However, in this case there is ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix. . In the light of the above said ratio of the decision of the Apex Court, I find that in the case on hand the testimony of the prosecutrix discussed hereinabove suffers from no infirmity and she is a reliable and truthful witness. There is ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix in the form of the deposition of PW 2 to whom the prosecutrix had narrated the incident in the evening on the same day and she disclosed the occurrence to her husband immediately after he returned from attending the fair. Medical evidence is not of much relevance for the reason that prosecutrix was examined by Dr. Shyam after about 24 days from the alleged day of occurrence and further because she is a married woman and was habitual of sexual inter course. In the present case, the prosecutrix was medico legally examined after four days of the occurrence. In Karnel Singh v. State of M.P. 1995(3) RCR (Criminal) , it was observed as under: 7. The submission overlooks the fact that in India women are slow and hesitant to complain of such assaults and if the prosecutrix happens to be a married person she will not do anything without informing her husband. Merely because the complaint was lodged less than promptly does not raise the inference that the complaint was false. The reluctance to go to the police is because of society s attitude towards such women; it casts doubt and shame upon her rather than comfort and sympathize with her. Therefore, delay in lodging complaints in such cases does not necessarily indicate that her version is false. In view of the observations of the Hon ble Apex Court, it is necessary to notice the judgments relied by the counsel for the appellant. Reliance has been placed upon Tameezuddin @ Tammu v. State of (NCT) of Delhi 2009(4) RCR (Criminal) 345. A perusal of the said judgment reveals that the same is not attracted on the facts of the present case. Their Lordships of Hon ble Apex Court took into consideration the testimony of PW-1 prosecutrix where she told the appellant that everything was forgiven and forgotten. Another judgment relied by the counsel for the appellant rendered in State of Haryana v. Dilawar 2009(3) RCR (Criminal) 2001 is also not attracted, as the Court has given credence to the fact that Zile Singh PW-6 in that case had not supported the prosecution. Similarly Kishan v. State of Haryana 2009(3) RCR (Criminal) 480, a judgment rendered by a Single Bench of this Court is also not attracted on the facts of the present case, as it was held that the evidence of the prosecutrix was neither reliable nor trustworthy. It was further held that each case depends on its own facts and circumstances. Another judgment cited by counsel for the appellant, rendered by a Division Bench of Hon ble Apex Court in Pandurang Sitaram Bhagwat v. State of Maharashtra 2005(1) RCR (Criminal) 858 also states that each case is to be determined on the factual matrix of that case. This Court has already held that testimony of the prosecutrix aspires confidence, therefore, in view of the discussion made above and the observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court in the judgments relied, this Court is of the opinion that present appeal is devoid of any merit and is thus, liable to be dismissed. Counsel for the appellant has relied upon another judgment of this Court rendered in Balkar Singh v. State of Haryana 2007(4) RCR (Criminal) 597 to contend that taking into consideration long pendency of the trial, sentence awarded upon the appellant should be reduced to the minimum period prescribed. This Court is of the view that there are no special or adequate reasons to reduce the sentence awarded upon the accused appellant. It is not a case where the accused and the prosecutrix had eloped together. It is also not a case of love affair, where because the age of the prosecutrix was less therefore, the sentence should be reduced. In the present case, the appellant had committed offence of rape to satisfy his lust, therefore, there is no scope for reduction in sentence awarded to the accused appellant. Hence, this prayer is also declined. Dismissed. [KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA] JUDGE February 23, 2010 rps",

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mr. Harbhagwan Singh, Senior Advocate with Mr. Amit Kumar, Advocate for the appellant. Mr. Manish Deswal, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana for the State. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. Present appeal has been filed by Vidya Parshad Tiwari son of Ram Saran Tiwari. He was named as an accused in case FIR No.729 dated 14.06.1997 registered at Police Station Central Faridabad under Section 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to as, the Act ). The appellant has been convicted by the Court of Special Judge, Faridabad. The appellant was a Depot holder for supplying sugar and kerosene as ration to the beneficiaries under the Public Distribution System. The trial Court came to the conclusion that the accused had failed to maintain the account books properly regarding the months of May and June, 1997. He failed to account for 4 quintals 42 kilograms and 50 grams of sugar and 1005 liters of kerosene pertaining to the quota for the month of May, 1997. The appellant also failed to account for 900 liters of kerosene out of the allotted quota for the month of June, 1997. The appellant had not maintained the sales and stock registers in consonance with the provisions of Clause-9 of the Haryana Prevention of Hoarding and Maintenance of Quality Order, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as, the Quality Order ). Furthermore, it was held that the sale register of sugar for the month of May 1997 contained various blank entries against which signatures of the consumers were appended and thus, he had also violated Clause-6 of the Quality Order. For these violations, the appellant was held guilty of offence under Section 7 of the Act. Having held the appellant guilty, he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of one year and to pay a fine of Rs.5000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months. It has been submitted that the appellant had deposited the fine. In the present case, FIR was registered on the basis of a written communication sent by J.B. Gondia, District Food and Supplies Controller, Faridabad. It was stated in the FIR that the complainant along with his staff on 13th June, 1997 had conducted the inspection of the premises of Vidya Parshad Tiwari, Depot holder, Rajiv Nagar, Faridabad. The appellant had received 6 quintals of levy sugar from the wholesale godown of CONFED, Faridabad in the month of May 1997 for distribution to the ration-card holders. After inspection of the registers, it came to the light that the Depot holder had misappropriated 4 quintals 42 kilograms and 50 grams of sugar and there were blank entries in the register, which were allegedly signed by the consumers. At the time of inspection, there was no stock in the ration Depot. Furthermore, in the month of May 1997, the Depot holder lifted 2860 liters of kerosene for distribution. The Depot holder had not made any entry regarding the quantity of kerosene distributed to the ration-card holders. According to the register, the Depot holder had shown distribution of kerosene to 265 ration-card holders. If a maximum of 7 liters of kerosene per ration-card holder is taken into consideration, then also the Depot holder could not distribute more than liters of kerosene. In this manner, the Depot holder had misappropriated 1005 liters of kerosene. In the month of June 1997, the Depot holder had lifted 2860 liters of kerosene. No entry was shown in the sale register regarding quantity of the kerosene received and its distribution to the ration-card holders. The Depot holder had shown the distribution of kerosene to 280 ration-card holders. If a maximum of 7 liters of kerosene per ration-card holder is taken into consideration, then the total distribution will come to 1960 liters. In this manner the Depot holder had misappropriated 900 liters of kerosene. These violations gave rise to the presumption that the goods meant for distribution through Public Distribution System were sold at a higher price in the open market. For these alleged irregularities and violation of the Quality Order, Special Judge, Faridabad served notice of accusation upon the appellant on 12th January, 1998. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. J.B. Gondia, District Food and Supplies Controller, Faridabad appeared as PW-1. He reiterated as to what was stated in the complaint Ex.PA, contents of which have been noticed above. In cross examination, this witness stated that no ration-card holder came with any grievance at the spot against the accused. However, the following suggestion was put to this witness: It is wrong to suggest that the accused was ill in those days and in his absence kerosene and sugar were distributed to the card holders by his younger brother who might not have been able to maintain the record properly. I did not verify from the card holders whose names were entered in the registers that he or she had actually not received kerosene or sugar. It is wrong to suggest that the accused has been falsely implicated in this case. A perusal of the above suggestion reveals that the accused was conscious of not maintaining the record. Rishi Pal ASI PW-2 had arrested the appellant on 16th July, . Rurra Ram ASI PW-3 was entrusted with the investigation on th June, 1997. He had recorded the statements of the witnesses and had also prepared the rough site plan Ex.PB. Prosecution has placed on record the Quality Order as Ex.PC. Mr. Harbhagwan Singh, Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant, has extensively referred to the Quality Order Ex.PC. This order defines a Dealer as under: 2.(b) Dealer means a person engaged in the business of sale or storage for sale of any article, whether such business is carried on in retail or in wholesale, and include the distributing agent of the selling agent of such person; Clause 3 of the Quality Order reads as under: 3. The Government may, by notification, in the official Gazette, in respect of any article; (a) the maximum quantity which may, at any one time, be possessed by a dealer or a producer; (b) the maximum quantity which may, at any one time, be possessed by any consumer; (c) the maximum quantity which may, in any one transaction be sold to any person by a dealer or a producer; (d) the quantities fixed in respect of any article under this clause may be different in different localities; Provided that no stock limit shall be fixed in respect of producers regarding sugar, khandsari, gur and shakkar. It will also be apposite here to reproduce Clause 9 of the Quality Order: 9.(1) The physical stock balances of various articles in a fair price shop, authorized and approved by the Government or by any officer authorized by it in this behalf, shall conform to the book balance as per account books maintained by him. (2) All purchases, sales and production made will be correctly accounted for in the account books maintained and shall conform to the actual transaction made. It is contended before me that the Government has issued no notification under sub-clause 1 of Clause 6. It is further submitted that in terms of Clause 3 also, no notification was issued. It has been urged before me that until under Clauses 6 and 9, the State Government had prescribed maximum quantity of any article which may be sold to any consumer or group of consumers, it cannot be held that there was any misappropriation of kerosene or sugar by the appellant. I have given my thoughtful consideration to the submissions made before me. The prosecution may have failed to prove on record the subsequent notification which prescribes maximum quantity of an article which can be issued to a card holder. It is evident that the prevailing practice demands that sale and stock registers ought to have been truthfully filled by the appellant. The appellant is also conscious of this fact. Therefore, a suggestion was given that due to sickness, the appellant may not have filled up the registers and the Depot was managed by his brother Ram Parkash Tiwari. The statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating circumstances were put to him. He denied the same and stated as under: I am innocent. Entries in the registers Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-4 are in the handwriting of my brother Ram Parkash Tiwari, who committed some mistakes. Furthermore, Ram Parkash Tiwari was examined as DW-1, who in examination in chief stated as under: Vidya Parshad accused is my brother. On 11th of April, he had gone to his native village as our mother was ill at that time. He returned around 15th or 16th of June, 1997. In his absence I had looked after the running of his ration depot. I had distributed various articles to the consumers against ration cards. I could not maintain appropriate entries in the account books because of rush and my lack of experience. Thus, it is a case of the accused that the requisite registers were not maintained and they had not depicted the quota received, the sales effected and the stocks available. Consequently, there was a violation of Clause 9 of the Quality Order, which specifically provides that physical stock balance of various articles in a fair-price-shop should conform to the book balance as per the account books maintained by the Dealer. Having held that the appellant had not maintained the registers in consonance with the procedure prescribed, it is difficult for this Court to assume that the stock not available was sold in the open market. Thus, this Court at the most can say that the appellant was remiss in his duty to maintain the necessary registers and account books. The offence under Section 7 of the Act is punishable for a term which should not be less than three months but which may extend upto seven years. Furthermore, all offences under the Act are to be tried in a summary manner under Section 12-A of the Act and the maximum sentence which a Court can award for a summary trial is two years. The inspection, in the present case, was carried in the month of June 1997. The appellant is in corridors of the Courts for the last about years and he has suffered mental pain and agony of a protracted trial. Since this Court has already held that the appellant had failed to maintain the requisite registers and the account books, it would be in the interest of justice in case sentence of the appellant is reduced from one year to three months rigorous imprisonment. With the aforesaid modification in sentence, present appeal is disposed of. [KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA] JUDGE March 23, 2010 rps",

    "court": "-1- IN THE HIGH COURT FOR THE STATES OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH Date of Decision: 26.04.2013 Rameshwar Dass Singla ...Petitioner Versus State of Punjab and another ...Respondents CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AMOL RATTAN SINGH Present: Mr. Puneet Gupta, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. K.K. Gupta, Addl. Advocate General, Punjab for the respondents-State. *** Amol Rattan Singh, J. . In this petition, the petitioner has sought the benefits of the service rendered by him with the Government of Himachal Pradesh, as a College Lecturer, towards protection of substantive pay, pay fixation and other benefits, including pensionary benefits, for his subsequent service with the Punjab Government. . At the very outset, Sh. Puneet Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, stated that he only presses the case for grant of benefit of the said service in Himachal Pradesh, for pensionary benefits. . The admitted facts of the case are that, the petitioner was appointed as a Lecturer of Economics in the Education Department of -2- Himachal Pradesh on 29.09.1967, in the pay scale of `300-600/-. He was confirmed as such w.e.f. 10.03.1972. . In response to an advertisement issued by the Punjab Public Service Commission, for recruitment to the post of Statistical Officer (PAS Class-I), in the Agriculture Department of the Punjab Government, the petitioner applied through proper channel and his application was forwarded by the Director of the Education Department, Himachal Pradesh to the Secretary, Punjab Public Service Commission, Patiala, vide letter dated 31.08.1973, (annexed as Annexure P-1 with the petition). . Having been duly selected by the Commission, he was appointed as Statistical Officer, in the pay scale of `400-1250/-. Consequent thereupon, the Director of Education, Himachal Pradesh, ordered his relieving on 27.05.1974, with the condition that he would resign his post on the expiry of two years from the date of his relieving, in case he does not join back in the department; that's to say, his lien was retained for a period of two years, in the Department of Education, in Himachal Pradesh. He was actually relieved by the Principal, Government College, Nahan (Himachal Pradesh), on the afternoon of 30.05.1974, on which date he was drawing a substantive pay of `450/-. He joined thereafter, in Punjab. Thereafter, he resigned from Himachal Pradesh, and his resignation was accepted w.e.f. 31.05.1976, vide order dated .10.1976, which is also annexed as Annexure P-3 with the petition. . It is stated by the petitioner, and not denied by the respondents, that upon entering into service in Punjab, he represented to -3- the respondents that his pay at the rate of `450/- be protected, as he was a confirmed employed of the Himachal Pradesh Government and that the same benefit had been granted to one Sh. Sukhdev Singh, who was earlier working with the Himachal Pradesh Government and was subsequently employed by the respondent department, i.e. Directorate of Agriculture, Punjab. . Vide letter dated 13.9.1988, the petitioner was informed that his case for counting temporary service rendered in the Government of Himachal Pradesh, would be considered as soon as he is confirmed in his present post, i.e. the post of Statistical Officer. Though, in the reply, it is stated that his representation was rejected in the year , but it is, at the same time, admitted that it was subsequently decided on 19.04.1988, that his case for counting of previous service would be considered upon his confirmation. . Thereafter, the petitioner was confirmed in the Punjab Agriculture Service, Class-I, on 02.11.1992, upon which he again represented for benefit of previous service. The representation having been rejected in March, 1994, he yet again represented on 04.10.1994 that his case be considered sympathetically, upon which he was again informed on 19.05.1995 that his case had already been rejected earlier. These factual aspects are not denied in the reply filed by the respondents. . The stand taken in the reply filed, is that, since the petitioner had not requested the Punjab Public Service Commission for protection of his pay for pensionary purposes, at the time when he applied for the post of Statistical Officer, Punjab, his case has been -4- rejected. As opposed to this, the case of Sh. Sukhdev Singh, cited by the petitioner, was accepted, in view of the fact that he had made such a representation, along with his application, to the Punjab Public Service Commission, which had accepted the same. Consequently, the Government had implemented the decision of the Punjab Public Service Commission. . Sh. Puneet Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, has drawn my attention to copy of a Memo dated 20.03.1986 (Annexure P- ), issued by the Department of Finance and addressed to all the Heads of Departments in the State of Punjab, duly received by the Director, Agriculture, Punjab, i.e. respondent No.2. The said memo/circular states, in effect, that, after consultations between the Governments of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, it has been decided, on reciprocal basis, that the proportionate pensionary liability in respect of those temporary employees, who had rendered temporary service under either the Punjab or the Himachal Pradesh Governments, prior to obtaining posts under the other State Government, would be shared by such previous government to the extent that such service qualified for pensionary benefits. The said circular is reproduced here, in extenso: Copy of Memo. No.16/98/80-IFP-III/4525, dated: 20.03.1986 from Deputy Secretary Finance(s), Government of Punjab, Department of Finance (Finance Personnel III Branch) addressed to all the Heads of Departments and others. Subject: Allocation of Pensionary liability in respect of temporary service rendered under the Government of Punjab and the Government of Himachal Pradesh. Sir, -5- I am directed to refer to the subject noted above and to say that the Government of Punjab has been considering in consultation with the Government of Himachal Pradesh the question of sharing, on a reciprocal basis, the proportionate pensionary liabilities in respect of those temporary employees who had rendered temporary service under either of the State Governments of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh prior to obtaining posts under the other State Government on their own volition in response to advertisements or circulars, including those by the State Public Service Commissions and who are eventually confirmed in their new posts. It has since been decided by the Government of Punjab, with the concurrence of the Government of Himachal Pradesh, that:- i) in cases in which an employee has rendered temporary service under the Government of Himachal Pradesh before joining service with the Government of Punjab, the liability of pensionary benefits for the service will be shared by the Government of Himachal Pradesh to the extent that service would have qualified for the grant of pension under the pension rules applicable to the employees of the Government of Himachal Pradesh; ii) the liability of pensionary benefits for the temporary services rendered under the Government of Punjab before joining service with the Government of Himachal Pradesh will be shared by the Government of Punjab to the extent that service would have qualified for pension under the rules of the Government of Punjab; iii) the amount of pension shall be determined by the Government from the service of which the employee finally retires in acordance with the pension formula applicable in that Government at the time of retirement of the employee; and iv) the gratuity, if any, received by the employees for temporary service under either State Government will have to be refunded by them to the State Government from which it was received for the service under that Government. . This benefit will be admissible only to the following categories of employees namely:- i) those who having been retrenched from the service of the either of the State Governments obtained on their own employment under these State Governments either with or without interruption between the date of retrenchment and the date of retrenchment and the date of new appointment; and -6- ii) those who while holding temporary posts under either of the State Governments apply for posts under the other State Government through proper channel/with permission of the Administrative authority concerned. . The benefit may be allowed in such cases also in which an employee is required, for administrative reasons/ for satisfying technical requirement, to tender resignation from the temporary post held by him before joining the new appointment, and a certificate, to the effect that such resignation had been tendered for administrative reasons/to satisfy a technical requirement to join the new posts with the permission of the Administrative authority concerned may be issued by the authority accepting the resignation. Necessary record may also be made in the service book under proper attestation to enable the employee concerned to get this benefit at the time of retirement. . These orders shall come into force with effect from the 31st March, 1982 and cases of all employees retiring on that date or thereafter will be regulated accordingly. No.16/9889-IFPIII/4526, dated: Chandigarh the, 20.03.1986 A copy, each, with spare copy signed in ink, is forwarded to:- i) The Accountant General (Accounts and Entitlement) Punjab, Chandigarh. ii) The Accountant General (Audit), Punjab, Chandigarh. for information and necessary action. Endst. No.5367-5427-/10-61-XVIII/E1(4), dt. Chandigarh, the 15.4.86 A copy is forwarded to:- ) All the State Level Officers. ) All the Chief Agricultural Officers. ) EI(1), EI(2), and EI(7) Assistants of Establishment Branch-I ) Supdt. Estt. Branch II (with Four spare copies) ) All Officers/Branch Incharges (except Supdt. Establishment Branch I & II) in the Department of Agriculture, Pb. Chandigarh, for information and necessary action. Sd/- D.D.A (HQ) for Director of Agriculture, Punjab. -7- . The reply given by the respondents to the relevant para (Para No.8), where the said circular has been referred to and relied upon by the petitioner, is the same; that is, that at the time of his selection, the petitioner had neither requested the Punjab Public Service Commission for protection of his pay on his selection as Statistical Officer, nor had the Punjab Public Service Commission recommended the same. . On a query put to Sh. K.K. Gupta, learned Addl. Advocate General, Punjab, he has relied upon the same submissions as made in the written statement; and has further argued that, it was for the petitioner to apply to the Himachal Pradesh Government to grant him such pensionary benefits. . I absolutely fail to understand, as to how the stand taken in the written statement, and by the learned counsel for the respondents, is tenable in any manner, in the face of the clear cut circular/instructions issued by the Finance Department, vide Memo dated 20.03.1986, reproduced hereinabove. As to why the petitioner (now a pensioner), should be made to run to the Government of Himachal Prades to claim his pensionary benefits, when the present respondents (State of Punjab in the Department of Agriculture), are bound by the said circular/instructions, is not understandable. The circular makes it incumbent upon the Punjab Government, to claim proportionate share of the petitioner pension from the Himachal Pradesh Government. It needs mention that nowhere in the reply is it stated that the petitioner's earlier service in Himachal Pradesh, does not qualify for pension. . No doubt, no plea has been raised by the respondents, but it is, nevertheless, necessary to deal with the same that, the said -8- circular/instructions, refer to only service rendered by temporary employees in either State, for the purpose of such service is to be counted in the either State, towards pensionary benefits. However, this cannot be a bar for an employee better placed than a temporary employee, who was confirmed in the first State and, thereafter, joined service of the second State. Thus, if benefit of temporary service in another State can be given to an employee in the second State, there is no rational basis, whatsoever, for denying such benefit to an employee who was confirmed in the first State and, subsequently was employed in the other State. . Further, though the Government of Himachal Pradesh has not been impleaded as a party in the present writ petition, however, in view of the fact that the Memo dated 20.03.1986 categorically refers to a reciprocal agreement between the two States, it would not be necessary for such impleadment, in view of the fact that the liability to be foisted on that Government, would be in terms of the reciprocal agreement so reached. . I, therefore, hold that the respondents would be bound by the said circular/instructions (dated 20.03.1986), which are not denied by them, and, as such, the petitioner would be entitled to the benefits of the same, as per its terms and conditions. . The writ petition is thus allowed, to the extent of grant of pensionary benefits to the petitioner, by counting his service rendered in Himachal Pradesh. The respondents are directed to work out all the pensionary benefits, admissible to the petitioner after counting the service rendered by him in the Government of Himachal Pradesh, prior -9- to his joining service in the State of Punjab on the post of Statistical Officeer. Such benefits would be worked out and paid to the petitioner within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order. . Needless to say, the liability to be incurred upon the Government of Himachal Pradesh would be taken up by the respondents with that State Government in terms of the reciprocal agreement reached between the two States, referred to in the Circular dated 20.03.1986.

It was further ordered that out of the amount of fine, Rs.3000/- shall be paid as compensation to the injured. Mr.Bipan Ghai, Senior Advocate assisted by Mr.M.L. Saini, Advocate, appearing for the appellant, has out-rightly submitted that he will not be able to assail the conviction of the appellant, as the injured Mukesh PW-6 had deposed against the appellant and his evidence has been held to be reliable by the trial Court. In his examination in-chief, Mukesh PW-6, had stated that on 6th December, 1993 at about 5.00 p.m. he was present in his house in village Pachagaon when he heard a noise outside the house. On hearing the noise, he along with his mother Ratni came out of the house and found that Joginder accused was beating his brother Narinder Singh. When he wanted to separate his brother, the accused appellant Kishan gave two lathi blows on his head, as a result of which he became unconscious. His mother took him to the house and therefrom, he was taken to Pushpanjli Hospital, Gurgaon. It is further stated in the examination in-chief that he remained in the Pushpanjli Hospital, Gurgaon from 6th December, 1993 to 8th December, 1993. In his cross examination, this witness stated that before the occurrence in question, neither there was any dispute nor any quarrel with the accused. Mukesh PW-6 had given his age as 16 years at the time of recording of his evidence. The testimony of Mukesh PW-6 had been corroborated by his mother Ratni PW-8. Dr.Ashwani Kumar, Medical Practitioner appeared as PW-7 and deposed that on 6th December, 1993 he was employed as a part-time consultant at Pushpanjli Hospital, Gurgaon. He had admitted Mukesh on th December, 1993 and discharged him on 7th December, 1993. At the time of discharge, Mukesh was fully conscious and his condition was stable. Mukesh was again examined on 10th December, 1993 by Dr.Rajeev Sharma PW-4. He found following injuries on the person of Mukesh: . Cut lacerated wound on left side parietal region 2 cm from the mid-line, size 2 cm x 1 cm. . Deep abrasion size 2 cm x 0.5 cm, two fingers below and posterior to injury No.1. This witness in the cross examination stated that probability of both the injuries having been caused by one blow or by fall on hard surface cannot be ruled out. Dr.Monika Chaudhary PW-5 stated that she had conducted radiological examination of Mukesh and found that there was a fracture of left parieto occipital bone. Dr.Raj Kumar PW-14 stated that Mukesh was admitted in Ward No.5/3 with head injury. He was discharged on 20th December, . There was a fracture of skull of left parieto occipital bone and it was a depressed fracture. In view of the medical evidence noticed above, the learned counsel has prayed for reduction of sentence without assailing the conviction. From the medical evidence noticed above, it has emerged that the injured Mukesh had suffered two injuries. Injury No.2 was abrasion whereas injury No.1 had caused fracture of left parieto occipital bone. The injured was admitted on 6th December, 1993 in a private hospital and was discharged on 7th December, 1993. He was again admitted in Medical College and Hospital, Rohtak on 10th December, 1993 and was discharged on 20th December, 1993. It has nowhere emerged in the evidence that the injury had caused oedema of the brain or had caused any permanent damage to the injured Mukesh PW-6. Furthermore, the trial Court has found that the offence in the present case will not fall under Section 308 IPC but under Section 325 IPC. Occurrence, in the present case, had taken place in the year . A period of more than 16 years has already elapsed. The appellant is in the corridors of the Court since long and has suffered mental pain and agony of a protracted trial. Taking all these factors into consideration, this Court is of the view that ends of justice will be fully met in case sentence awarded upon the appellant is reduced from 3 years to 1 years rigorous imprisonment. With the modifications in sentence noticed above, present appeal is disposed of.",

Mr. Vishal Munjal, Additional Advocate General, Punjab. -.- MOHINDER PAL, J. Impugned in this appeal is the judgment of conviction and the sentence order passed by the learned Sessions Judge, Ludhiana, convicting and sentencing the appellants under Section 498-A and 304-B of the Indian Penal Code (for short `the Code'). For the former offences, the appellants were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay fine of Rs.500/-, each, in default whereof to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for one month and for the latter -2- offence the appellants were sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for seven years. The substantive sentences of imprisonment awarded to the appellants were ordered to run concurrently. The instant case was registered at the instance of Kahan Singh, brother of Harbans Kaur (deceased). As per facts of the case, Harbans Kaur (deceased) was married to appellant Tapinderpal Singh on 18.2.1994. Sufficient dowry was given at the time of marriage by the parents of Harbans Kaur according to their status. Seven or eight days after the marriage, appellant Tapinderpal Singh, husband of Harbans Kaur, Avtar Singh, her father-in-law and Kartar Kaur, her mother-in-law started telling her that her parents had not given sufficient dowry. On this account, she was mal-treated and was asked to bring Rs.25,000/- from her parents. Harbans Kaur stated the fact of demand of dowry and ill-treatment by the accused on her visit to her parents prior to `Lohri' festival. Kahan Singh, brother of Harbans Kaur, Gurcharan Singh, a cousin brother of Harbans Kaur and the mother of Harbans Kaur went to the house of the accused one day prior to the `Lohri' and at that time Harbans Kaur stated that she was being subjected to ill-treatment on account of demand of dowry. Kahan Singh, Gurcharan Singh and the mother of Harbans Kaur told the accused that they were not in a position to pay the amount and that the same would be paid to the accused after harvesting the crop. On 3.2.1995, complainant Kahan Singh along with -3- Gurcharan Singh again went to meet Harbans Kaur in her matrimonial house. On reaching there, they came to know from the neighbours that Harbans Kaur had been taken to hospital at Sudhar. Then they went to the hospital and learnt that Harbans Kaur had died. Suspecting foul play, complainant Kahan Singh went to the police and got registered the instant case against the appellants. After completion of investigation and due formalities, challan against the accused was presented before the Ilaqa Magistrate, who committed the case to the Court of Session. Charge under Sections 498-A and 304-B of the Code was framed against the accused, who did not plead guilty to the charge and claimed trial. At the trial, the prosecution examined Draftsman Sukhwinder Singh (P.W.1), Dr. S.K. Gupta (P.W.2), complainant Kahan Singh (P.W.3), Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4), Sub Inspector Sikattar Singh (P.W.5), Assistant Sub Inspector Makhan Singh (P.W.6) and Constable Balbir Singh (P.W.7).

Versus Hem Chand son of Shri Amra Ram, caste arora, resident of Main Market, Charkhi Dadri. ....Respondent. CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAM SUNDER. Present: Sh.O.P.Goyal Sr.Adv., with Ms.Pawanpreet Kaur Adv. For the petitioner. None for the respondent. JUDGMENT: This revision petition is directed against the judgment dated 28.01.1991 rendered by the Appellate Authority (Additional Distt. Judge), Bhiwani vide which it dismissed the appeal against the order dated 29.09.1989 of the Rent Controller, Charkhi Dadri, fixing the fair rent of the demised premises @ Rs.86/- including house tax w.e.f. 06.01.1988. . The landlord/petitioner inducted the respondent, as a tenant in the demised premises as fully detailed, in the ejectment application, at a monthly rental of Rs.78/- + house tax. The ejectment of the respondent/tenant, was sought, on the ground, that he had been in arrears of rent from. 01.11.1987 to 31.12.1987 + house tax, amounting to Rs.108/-. Prayer for fixation of fair rent, was also made, on the ground that after 01.09.1982 when the fair rent, was earlier fixed, there has been an increase in the price index. Accordingly, a combined application under Sections 13 & 4 of Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973, was CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.1436 OF 1991 -2- filed by the landlord/petitioner. . Upon notice, the respondent/tenant, put in appearance, and filed written statement, wherein, he admitted the relationship of landlord and tenant. The rate of rent, at Rs.78/- per month (including house tax), was admitted. It was stated that the arrears of rent, demanded by the landlord/petitioner, had already been paid by him. It was further stated that the fair rent of the shop in-question, at Rs.78/- per month, had already been fixed and there had been no increase in the price index, and, thus, there was no question of fixing the fair rent again. . In the replication, filed by the landlord/petitioner, he reiterated all the averments, contained in the petition and repudiated those contained in the written statement. . On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were struck, by the Rent controller:- . Whether the respondent is liable to be ejected from the premises indispute, as alleged? OPA . Whether there are grounds for the fixation of fair rent, if so at what rate ? OPA . Whether the applicant has no locus-standi to file the application ? OPR . Whether the application is bad for non-joinder of necessary parties ? OPR . Relief. . The parties led documentary, as well as oral evidence, in support of their case. After hearing the Counsel for the parties, and on, going through the record of the case, the Rent Controller, fixed the fair rent at Rs.86/- (round figure) per month, w.e.f. .01.1988 including house tax. Since the Counsel for the landlord/petitioner conceded that the respondent had paid the arrears of rent, including cost and interest, no finding was recorded on issue No.1, as the same was rendered redundant. -3- . Feeling aggrieved, against the judgment dated .09.1989, the landlord preferred an appeal, which was dismissed by the Appellate Authority (Additional Distt. Judge), Bhiwani. . Dissatisfied with the judgments of the Courts below, the instant revision petition, was filed by the landlord/petitioner. . Notice of the petition, was given to the respondent/tenant. Initially, Counsel for the respondent/tenant, put in appearance but, lateron none appeared on his behalf. . I have heard the Counsel for the petitioner and have gone through the record of the case carefully. . The learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the formula for fixing the fair rent, depicted in Section 4(2) of Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973, was interpreted and approved by a Division Bench of this Court in Yoginder Mohan Versus Krishan Lal 2000(1) PLR 788. It is to be determined, as to whether, the Courts below, fixed the fair rent in accordance with the formula, referred to above, and in consonance with the principle of law laid down in Yoginder Mohan's case (supra). Admittedly, the basic rent, in this case, was Rs.78/- per month including house tax in the year 1982. The application, out of the decision whereof, the instant revision petition has arisen, was filed on 06.01.1988. The price index of the year 1982 was Rs.285.3 paise and of the year 1987 i.e. one year preceding the filing of the application was Rs.395.7. Under these circumstances, the difference came to be Rs.110.4 or Rs.110/- (round figure). The percentage of difference, between the two figures of price index, came to be Rs.38.69%. The Court could grant increase or decrease to the maximum of 25% under Section 4 (3) of the Act which came to be 9.67%. On this basis the increase in the fair rent came to be Rs.7.54 (78/9.67x100). The -4- fair rent, therefore, came to be Rs.78+7.54 = Rs.85.54. The round figure of fair rent, therefore, came to be Rs.86/- per month w.e.f. .01.1988 including house tax. The calculations were also depicted by the Counsel for the revision petitioner, in a separate chart, which are in consonance with the decision rendered by the Courts below. The Courts below, in my opinion, rightly calculated the fair rent, in accordance with the formula, referred to above, and the principle of law, laid down, in Yoginder Mohan's case (Supra). The judgments of the Lower Courts, therefore, do not suffer from any illegality or infirmity and, therefore, no interference is called for therewith. . For the reasons recorded hereinbefore, the revision- petition, is dismissed with no order as to costs. December 05, 2007 (Sham Sunder) mamta m Judge",

Respondents CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN Present:- Mr. H. S. Saini, Advocate for the petitioners. Ms. Lisa Gill, Advocate for the respondents. **** K. Kannan, J (oral). . The writ petitioners who were Junior Assistants posted as Readers in the subordinate judiciary challenge the reduction of pay scales and recoveries sought to be made when through the proceedings of the Government of Punjab, Department of Finance, notification issued on 19.5.1998, the government had decided to amend the Second Schedule to the Punjab Civil Service Revised Pay First Amendment Rules of 1998. The amendment was issued to take effect from .1.1996 retrospectively. . The petitioners' complaint is that they had been working as ministerial staff as Senior Clerks and Junior Assistants who were put on time scale of Rs.1500-2700 and after 1.1.1996 the scales had been revised and assigned to the scale of Rs.5000-8100. By the impugned proceedings through an office order dated 13.9.1999, the junior assistants were put in the time scale of Rs.4400-7000 w.e.f. 1.1.1996. This resulted in a reduction of scale of pay for persons who had drawn a higher pay when the scales were revised to 5000-8100. When the revision of scales had taken place, it was reduced from Rs.5000-8100 to 4400-7000 and no pay protection had been given to them unlike other classes of persons to whom such protection was given. According to the petitioner the retrospective reduction of scale without protecting the pay which they were drawing was arbitrary. It also discriminated when certain other classes of persons, who like the Duplicating Machine Operators, belonging to the operational staff had been given pay protection when the scale of pay had been reduced. Similarly even in the National Training Institute the craft instructors were given pay protection by applying it uniformly to all persons, whether promoted before or after 1.1.1996. . All the petitioners are persons who had been promoted after 1.1.1996 and who had obtained the higher revised scale but when the revision of scale had been made to a lower scale the higher salary drawn was not protected. Learned counsel for the petitioner refers to a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chairman Railway Board and others Vs. C.R. Rangadhamaiah and others (1997) 6 SCC 623 that dealt with the case of effect of retrospective amendment withdrawing vested or accrued rights of government employees. The Hon'ble Supreme Court held that any retrospective amendment which has the effect of taking away an accrued right of an employee would be liable to be struck down. Learned counsel also refers to a situation of 10 other employees similarly placed, who were working as Junior Assistants in various other departments like Colleges in U.T.Administration, Chandigarh and who were afforded the pay protection while retrospective application of scale of pay was sought to be made through an intervention of order of the Central Administrative Tribunal in OA No. 316/CH/2001 by its order dated .3.2003. According to him, the petitioners could not have any relief before CAT only because they were members of the judiciary and therefore they have sought relief before this Court and they should also enjoy the same relief as the persons similarly situated. . The office order, while reducing the scales of pay to Rs.4400-7000 against the existing scale of Rs.5000-8100 could not have restricted the benefit of pay protection only to persons who had been promoted even before 1.1.1996. If the revision of pay scales had not been brought immediately on 1.1.1996 and all the petitioners had been provided for higher scales from 1.1.1996 an office order that was brought on .9.1999 could not deny such protection to persons who had been promoted subsequently on 1.1.1996 and who had received the higher scales. The revised scale of Rs.4400-7000 should be applied only after providing for protection of salary at the scale which they were drawing. Accordingly, the impugned office order under Annexure P-1 is quashed. . The writ petition is allowed with protection granted as aforesaid. There shall, however, be no order as to costs. (K.

(Oral) In the present case, Special Judge Sirsa in a most cryptic manner, without any application of mind, has discharged the accused only on the ground that in application submitted by DSP, it has been stated that only charge under Section 323 IPC is made out. It was incumbent upon the Court to apply its own mind and arrive at its own conclusion. The report of DSP cannot be accepted as a final word. The Special Judge Sirsa could not make out the difference that application was for discharge from custody and not discharge from case. Furthermore, no notice was issued to complainant before accepting the request in writing made by the DSP. The mandate laid in Bhagwant Singh v. Commissioner of Police & Anr.

Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? *** Present: Shri Sumeet Sangwan,Advocate, for Shri Harish Rathee, Advocate, for the petitioner. None for the respondent. *** DR.BHARAT BHUSHAN PARSOON, J In this Civil Writ petition filed under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner has sought a writ in the nature of Mandamus or any other writ or orders against the respondent-M.D. University (hereinafter to be referred to as the respondent-University ), to consider his case for promotion to the post of Assistant with effect from the date, his juniors were promoted, along with other consequential benefits. Direction was also sought against the respondent-University for placing the petitioner at serial No. 261 above Shri Rajbir Singh, in the seniority list, taking into account the date of joining of the petitioner on the post of Clerk on ad hoc basis. Claim of the petitioner is that the petitioner was appointed as Clerk on adhoc basis on 25.3.1983 , vide letter (Annexure P-1). His services were regularized on the said post vide order dated 10.11.1983 ( Annexure P-2). Taking the wrong date of appointment of the petitioner as a regular clerk i.e 28.11.1983, he was placed at serial No. 330 in the seniority list and for this reason he was not promoted as Assistant. Further claim of the petitioner is that in fact he joined his duties on .3.1983 and thus he should have been placed at serial No. 261 in the seniority list. It is averred that the petitioner was wrongly not promoted as Assistant and even his representation (Annexure P-7) for assigning appropriate place in the seniority list, was not considered. In addition, the petitioner has claimed that the respondent- University violated its own service rules for non-teaching employees. It is also claimed that the petitioner was treated differently though he was similarly situated with other employees, whose services rendered on adhoc basis were counted towards their probation period but the same benefit was denied to the petitioner. The stand of the respondent-University on the contrary is that no right much less statutory, has been infringed. It has been explained that the petitioner was initially appointed as a Clerk purely on adhoc basis and for a period of six months and that too subject to compliance of certain conditions with effect from 26.3.1983 and had been given extension from time to time. One of the conditions contained in the letter of appointment was that the petitioner has to qualify the written test as well as typing test in English at a speed of 30 words per minute. On his passing the written test, services of the petitioner were regularized by the University with effect from 22.11.1983 but, he was further required to pass the type test. Later on, when he could not qualify the type test, relaxing this condition, on expiry of two years of his probation period, he was confirmed with effect from 28.11.1985. It is claimed that service rendered by the petitioner on adhoc basis, thus , cannot be counted towards his seniority. It has also been explained that before preparing the final seniority list, in May 1988 objections were invited from the concerned officials within 10 days of the issue of the circular, with clear stipulation that in absence of any objections raised within the stipulated period, the seniority list will be treated as final and that since the petitioner had not raised any objection, it was finalized thereafter. Qua claim of the petitioner that other non-teaching employees promoted as Assistants were given the benefits of adhoc service in counting their service period, it is clarified that they had been appointed on regular basis without any rider or conditions attached to their appointment, which was not the case of the petitioner, as he was required to qualify the written examination as also the typing test. In short, the University had claimed that the petitioner had correctly been placed in the seniority list according to the Rules of the University. Prayer for dismissal of the petition was made. Since, there is no representation on behalf of the respondent-University in this petition and the matter is of 1992, instead of adjourning the case for the appearance of the counsel for respondent- University, it is considered appropriate to dispose of the matter after hearing learned counsel for the petitioner. I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused the documents placed on the record. In the seniority list issued by the respondent-University name of the petitioner is appearing at serial No. 330, taking the date as .11.1983 i.e the date of his regularization. No doubt, pursuant to his appointment on adhoc basis, the petitioner had joined his duties on .3.1983 but the said period of service rendered on adhoc basis was not counted towards the period of regularization. The reason is not far to seek. It is rather revealed that the petitioner was appointed on 25.3.1983 purely on adhoc basis for a period of six months on the post of a clerk and he joined on 26.03.1983 and was required to qualify the prescribed written test as well as typing test in English and further his services were liable to be terminated at any time without any notice. Accepting these conditions contained in the appointment letter dated 25.3.1983, the petitioner joined his duties on 26.3.1983. Vide letter dated 10.11.1983, services of the petitioner were ordered to be regularized, subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions contained therein which included Verification of character and antecedents as also production of medical fitness Certification from a competent authority . On the fulfillment of said conditions, services of the petitioner were regularized with effect from 22.11.1983 i.e the date on which the said conditions had been fulfilled by the petitioner. Notwithstanding regularization of services of the petitioner with effect from 22,12,1983 (as per communication of 25.10.1984), the petitioner was required to pass the type test in English at the speed of 30 words per minutes before being considered for confirmation on completion of probation period of one year which was to be counted with effect from 22.11.1983. Despite the extension of period of probation, the petitioner had failed to qualify the requisite type test from time to time, till the expiry of period of two years of probation and even thereafter. Showing benevolent mercy, the respondent-University relaxed the condition of passing of typing test and after completion of the extended period of probation of two years, the petitioner was confirmed as a Clerk. From the factual matrix as discussed earlier, it is clear that passing of the typing test was a condition precedent for regularization. Coupled with character verification and antecedents as also production of medical fitness certificate, without waiting for the passing of requisite typing test, services of the petitioner were regularized vide letter dated .10.1984 (Annexure P-3). Since the petitioner was required to qualify the typing test during the period of probation one year, on his failure to do so his services were to be terminated automatically on this ground. Condition No.3 of letter dated 25.10.1984 (Annexure P-3) is extracted as under:- You will, therefore, be on probation for a period of one year in the first instance and the probation will be counted with effect from .11.1983. You will, however, have to qualify the type test in English at the speed of 30 words per minutes before you are considered for confirmation on the completion of your probationary period. In the event of your failure to qualify the type test, your services may stand terminated automatically on this ground . The University instead of terminating services of the petitioner for his failure to qualify the typing test, provided him sustenance and support by relaxing the condition of passing of typing test but the petitioner instead of showing his gratitude towards the University has raised his accusing finger at the respondent and that too without any basis. Stand of the University that the seniority list was prepared on the basis of date of joining of the concerned employees on regular post, and that too after considering the objections from the concerned officials, could not be assailed by the learned counsel for the petitioner. Thus, it is clear that adhering to the Service Rules, the University had acted fairly and had rather relaxed the condition of passing of the typing test when the petitioner had not been able to qualify the said test even during the extended period of probation of two years. In fact this large hearted approach of the University had attributed towards the retention of the petitioner in service otherwise in terms of (extracted earlier), the petitioner was to be off the job. As far as counting of adhoc service rendered by the petitioner is concerned, when the petitioner had not been able to qualify the requisite typing test (which was a condition precedent), he was neither eligible to be appointed as a clerk nor was to be retained in service. The period of adhoc service of the petitioner could not be counted towards the probation period. Stand of the petitioner that he has wrongly been placed at serial No. 330 in the seniority list, taking the date of his joining the post of clerk inter-alia on regular basis (i.e after complying with the other requisite conditions), is without any substance. When clerks other than the petitioner, were promoted as Assistants in terms of their seniority viz-a-viz from the date of joining regular service, they cannot be considered juniors to the petitioner. Looking from another angle, the petitioner was regularized on the post of a clerk vide letter dated 25.10.1984 with effect from .11.1983 ignoring the service rendered by him on adhoc basis and only after counting the regular service rendered by the petitioner, he was confirmed as a clerk with effect from 28.11.1985 vide communication dated 22.3.1986. He, however filed the present writ petition only on .1.1992. Thus, there is long delay in filing the petition revealing that the petitioner had been in long slumber. Consequently, when the petitioner has not been able to show violation of any Service Rules and when his appointment was on adhoc basis, dehors the Rules and was subject to the condition of qualifying the written examination as also of passing of requisite type test in English, the respondent University was right in excluding the period of adhoc service for determination of the seniority. It was also so held in 2001(3) RSJ 15 (SC)- State of Punjab and others Vs. Gurdeep Kumar Uppal and others; 2000(4) RSJ 167 (SC)- State of Haryana Vs. Haryana Veterinary and A.H.T.S. Asson and another and Civil Appeal No. of 2012 (arising out of SLP No. 29274 of 2009) State of Haryana and others Vs. Vijay Singh and others. As a result of above discussion the writ petition is without any merit and is dismissed. July 8, 2013 (DR.BHARAT BHUSHAN PARSOON) Malik JUDGE",

(ORAL) In the present case, it has been submitted by learned counsel for the State that report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted on 16th September, 1998. I have heard learned counsel for the petitioner. Disputed questions of fact are involved in the present case, which cannot be gone into in proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. At this stage, counsel for the petitioner submits that he may be allowed to withdraw the present petition to raise all arguments before the trial Court at the time of framing of charge. Counsel for the petitioner is sanguine that even from the challan submitted, no offence is made out and he will be discharged. Since the present petition was filed in year 1998 and proceedings in the FIR emanated in year 1997, taking into consideration CRM No. 2197-M of 1998 long pendency of the case, it will be just and appropriate in case the personal appearance of the accused before the trial Court is exempted. Accordingly, it is ordered that the personal appearance of the accused shall remain exempted before the trial Court, subject to his filing an undertaking that he shall cause his appearance as and when required by the trial Court. He shall also file an undertaking that the evidence, if any, recorded in his absence but in the presence of his counsel, shall be binding upon him. The trial Court may incorporate any other conditions in the undertaking to be submitted by the accused. With these observations, present petition is disposed off.

    "court": "[1] IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH Date of decision: 17.10.2007 Raghbir Singh Petitioner Versus State of Haryana Respondent Coram: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Harbans Lal Present: Mr. Ajay Kansal, Advocate for the revisionist. Mr.PS Sullar, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana Harbans Lal, J. This revision is directed against the judgment dated 5.2.1992 rendered by the Court of Shri Darshan Singh, Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Hisar, whereby he convicted and sentenced the revision petitioner to undergo RI for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- or in default thereof to further undergo RI for a period one and half month, as well as judgment dated 8.7.1994 rendered by the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Hisar vide which the period of substantive sentence inflicted by the learned trial Court has been reduced from 6 months rigorous imprisonment to three months rigorous imprisonment maintaining the amount of fine of Rs.1000/- as well as its default clause. As set up by the prosecution, the revisionist- Raghbir Singh is a bus conductor in the employment of Haryana Roadways and is posted in the Office of General Manager, Haryana Roadways, Hisar (hereinafter to be referred as the G.M. ). On 30.6.1990 he was entrusted with bus fare tickets of the value of Rs. 27584/- for being issued to the passengers. He did not deposit the tickets nor the sale proceeds thereof. Thereupon, the G.M. sent a letter Ex.PW3/A to S.H.O., Police Station City Hisar on [2] .7.1990. On its basis, FIR Ex.PW5/A was recorded. The revisionist was placed under suspension vide order dated 12.9.1990. He put in his appearance before the G.M. on 12.11.1990 and explained his absence from .7.1990 to 13.11.1990. The latter sanctioned earned leave to the revisionist for the aforesaid period vide order dated 21.11.1990 (copy Ex.D2) and ordered his reinstatement w.e.f. 14.11.1990. He deposited a sum of Rs. 25052/- on 5.10.1990. Mr. Ajay Kansal, Advocate appearing for the revisionist has strenuously urged that as emanates from the evidence produced in defence, the revisionist remained at rest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and on leave from .7.1990 to 30.11.1990, which leave no scope for doubt that he never remained on duty after 30.6.1990 and as its consequence, there was no occasion for him to sell the tickets. He further puts that he deposited Rs.25402/- as well as the unsold tickets in the office of the G.M. on .10.1990 and in turn, the latter had written a letter for withdrawal of the case and in these premises, no criminal offence is made out against the revisionist. He further submits that in view of the legal position laid down in re: State of Punjab vs. Amarjit Singh, 1992(1) Recent Criminal Reports, 619, the courts below have gravely erred in recording the conviction of the petitioner. The next argument raised by the counsel appearing for the revisionist is that the prosecution has utterly failed to prove by leading any evidence on the file that the tickets issued to the revisionist on 30.6.1990 [3] were sold by him and in the absence of the same, no criminal offence under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code is made out. He further added to it that as transpires from the evidence trickled from the respective mouths of the prosecution witnesses, the revisionist was not on duty and was on rest/leave from 1.7.1990 till 13.11.1990 and these circumstances lead to the only inference that after 30.6.1990 he never remained on duty. To tide over these submissions Mr. PS Sullar, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana has maintained that the said amount was deposited by the revisionist after registration of the case and as would be apparent from the evidence, revisionist got manipulated the sanction of his leave and thus, it would be going too far to say that the charged offence is not established against the revisionist. I have given a deep and thoughtful consideration to the rival submissions. In Amarjit Singh's case (supra), on 29.4.1982, Amarjit Singh, who was working as a Conductor in Pepsu Road Transport Corporation, (for short 'PRTC') absented himself from his duty with a sum of Rs.3254.55 of PRTC, Kapurthala. The case was got registered against him. The Division Bench of this Court was pleased to observe as under : After accepting the deposit of Rs. 2804/- from the respondent on August 17,1982, it does not lie in the mouth of Pepsu Road Transport Corporation to urge that the charge of criminal breach of trust against the accused in respect of allegedly misappropriated amount [4] still subsists. Regarding failure of the accused to return the unsold tickets it has been held by the Supreme Court in Sardar Singh vs. State of Haryana, AIR 1977 Supreme Court 1766 that merely failure or omission to return property does not constitute an offence under Section of the Indian Penal Code, Relevant observations read, what the section requires is something much more than mere failure or omission to return the receipt book, The prosecution has to go further and show that the appellant dishonestly misappropriated or converted the receipt book to his own use or dishonestly used or, disposed of it. That, we are afraid, the prosecution has not been able to do in the present case. We are, therefore, of the view that the appellant was wrongly convicted under Section 409. Finding of not guilty returned by the learned trial court is, therefore, affirmed. To my mind, the case in hand is manifestly covered by Amarjit Singh's case (supra). A glance through Ex.D1 would reveal that an amount of Rs. 25402/- was deposited by the revisionist on 5.10.1990 with the concerned authority of Haryana Roadways. As per Ex.D1/A the tickets box as well as the value of the sold tickets were deposited on the said date by the revisionist. As emerges out of Ex.D2, another order, earned leave was sanctioned for the period from 16.7.1990 to 13.11.1990 in favour of the [5] revisionist by the competent authority. As revealed by Ex.D4, he was on rest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and on leave from 5.7.1990 to 15.7.1990. This official record is a clincher towards the fact that the revisionist remained on rest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and thereafter he proceeded on earned leave which has been duly sanctioned by the competent authority. The prosecution has not adduced any cogent, convincing and clear evidence leading to the conclusion that right from 1.7.1990 onwards, he remained on duty and had sold the tickets of Bus fare. It is own evidence of the complainant in the form of above discussed documents that the revisionist was on rest/leave during the above mentioned period. If so, how he could be expected to have sold the tickets. It is probable that when the revisionist learnt about the registration of case against him, he on some advice deposited the amount of Rs.25402/- alongwith tickets to save his job. As already noticed, there is no evidence regarding sale of tickets by the revisionist. He could have sold the tickets only to the Bus passengers. The prosecution has not produced any evidence as to on which Bus he was a conductor when he sold tickets. The revisionist after registration of the case might had apprehended his suspension and arrest in the case. To get rid of the same he might have thought to return some tickets and cash in lieu of the other tickets. In re: Pushpa Kumar Rai v. State of Sikkim 1978 Criminal Law Journal, 1379, their Lordships were pleased to observe that even if it is assumed that the accused had collected the amount, the offence did not fall under Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code which deals with breach of trust [6] by public servants and others. It was remarked as under:- In this case, therefore, even assuming that the accused was a conductor of the Bus of the Sikkim Nationalised Transport as alleged and in such capacity collected bus fares amounting to Rs. 2826.60p. as alleged or any other amount and failed to deposit the said amount, the accused can never be said to have been entrusted with that amount because the said amount was never 'made over' or 'transferred' or 'handed over', to the accused by anyone on behalf of the Sikkim Nationalised Transport. It also appears that in the charge itself the learned Sessions Judge did not state that the accused was entrusted with any amount but only stated that the accused was entrusted with collecting the bus fares . I am afraid that being entrusted with the doing of a job is not the same thing as being entrusted with any property within the meaning of S. 405 and other congnate Sections of the I.P.C. even though some money or other property may come into the hand of the person in the course of his doing such job. That being so, I am of the opinion that there was absolutely no material on record to frame a charge under S.409 against the accused. And if the charge framed was such as could not be framed on the materials on record, a plea of guilty to such a charge [7] is no plea in the eye of law and cannot be relied on by any Court, as the basis of any conviction. The learned Sessions Judge was, therefore, wrong in convicting the accused on the basis of his plea to the charge as framed by him and the order of conviction and sentence passed by him must, therefore, be set aside In re: Sardar Singh v. State of Haryana (1977) 1 Supreme Court Cases 463, their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court were pleased to observe as under: An essential ingredient of the offence under Section 405 is that the accused being in any manner entrusted with property or with dominion over property, dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own used that property or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust. Section 409 can be invoked only if it can be shown that the accused being in any manner entrusted with property or with dominion over property in his capacity as public servant committed criminal breach of trust in respect of that property. It requires something much more than mere failure or omission to return the property. [8] In the present case, the prosecution has not been able to show that the accused dishonestly misappropriated or converted the property to his own use or dishonestly used or disposed of it. Hence the conviction under Section 409 cannot stand. Reverting back to the facts of the instant case, the prosecution has not inducted any evidence to the effect that the revisionist had dishonestly misappropriated or converted the tickets to his own use or disposed of the alleged entrusted property in violation of any direction of law. There being dearth of such evidence, the offence is not established in view of the observations recorded in re: Sardar Singh's case (supra). In re: Harbhajan Lal vs. State of Punjab, 1984 (1) Recent Criminal Reports (Criminal) 567, the bus conductor had failed to return the unused tickets. The case under Section 409 of the Code was got registered against him. There was no evidence to the effect that the accused had sold the tickets and realized the amount. The Division Bench of this Court in these circumstances was pleased to hold that no case of misappropriation is made out unless there is a clear evidence that accused had realized the amount. Adverting to the facts of the current case, the defence evidence nullifies the prosecution case. Had the revisionist worked during the interregnum of 1.7.1990 to 13.11.1990, his rest/leave might had not been sanctioned. At the cost of repetition, it deserves to be pointed out here that, if he had worked on any Bus during the said period, the prosecution might had got proved the way bill of such Bus. Only then it",

JUSTICE PERMOD KOHLI. Present: Mr.R.P. Kansal, Advocate, for the petitioners. Mr.PC Goyal, Assistant Advocate General, Punjab. CWP No.7331 of 1988 :2: Mr.B.S. Wasu, Advocate, for Municipal Committees. Mr.Raj Kumar Gupta,Advocate,for respondents in CWP No.14349 of 1992. Mr.Arun Palli, Senior Advocate, with Mr.Tushar Sharma, Advocate, for respondents in CWP No.15048 of 1992. PERMOD KOHLI, J. (Oral): Since common questions of law and facts are involved in these writ petitions, the same are disposed of by this common order. The petitioners in all these cases are aggrieved of the enhancement of the rental value of the premises which has been made the basis for assessment of the house tax. The petitioners have relied upon Section 62 of the Punjab Municipal Act (hereinafter referred to as the Act ) to challenge the assessment. From the bare reading of Section 62 of the Act aforesaid, it is evident that this section applies where assessment is to be made for the first time. In the present cases, the properties are already assessed for the purposes of payment of House Tax and it is only the order of enhancement of the House Tax which has been impugned in these petitions. Learned counsel for the respondents has, however, taken the shelter of Section 67 of the Act. Section 67 of the Act permits reassessment or revision of the assessment under the circumstances indicated therein which, inter-alia, includes the erroneous assessment on account of mistake, fraud etc. The present cases do not fall in any of the conditions. However, Section 65 of the Act deals with revision of the assessment list, but this requires a public notice. Admittedly, no public CWP No.7331 of 1988 :3: noticed has been issued. Apart from the above, the respondents have assessed the rental value without any parameters being adopted, primarily on the grounds that adjoining premises is fetching a particular amount as rent. The issue relating to the assessment of the rental value has been considered by the Apex Court in Dewan Daulat Rai Kapoor etc. etc. Vs. New Delhi Municipal Committee and another etc. etc., AIR 1980, Supreme Court, 54, wherein the following observations have been made:- 11. .................We are, therefore, of the view that, even if the standard rent has not been fixed by the Controller, the landlord cannot reasonably expect to receive from a hypothetical tenant anything more than the standard rent determinable under the Act and this would be so equally whether the building has been let out to a tenant who has lost his right to apply for fixation of the standard rent or the building is self-occupied by the owner. The assessing authority would, in either case, have to arrive at its own figure of the standard rent by applying principles laid down in the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 for determination of standard rent and determine the annual value of the building on the basis of such figure of standard rent. Admittedly, in all these cases it is alleged by the petitioners that CWP No.7331 of 1988 :4: the premises are governed by the Rent Legislation and in view of the dictum of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court, the rental value could be as is being received by the landlord or where there is no such material, the fair rent being payable under Section 3 (1) (b) of the Act, is applicable. In view of the above circumstances, the impugned orders are unsustainable in law and are liable to be set aside. I order accordingly. Consequently, the maters are remitted back to the Municipal Committees concerned for reassessment of the rental value in accordance with the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court mentioned above. The concerned Municipal Committees will pass fresh orders after affording opportunity of being heard to the petitioners. With these observations the writ petitions are disposed of. The parties through their counsel are directed to appear before the concerned Municipal Committees on 01.09.2009 for further proceedings. A copy of this order be placed on the record of each concerned file. .07.2009 (PERMOD KOHLI) BLS JUEGE Note: Whether to be referred to the Reporter? NO",

Counsel for the parties have also stated in the same terms. Accordingly, the cases are taken up for hearing together. Briefly, the facts are that the Government of Haryana, Urban Estate Department, issued a notification dated 2.8.1989 under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act') proposing to acquire 194.97 acres of land situated in the revenue estate of village Mewla Maharajpur, Hadbast No.4, Tehsil Ballabgarh, District -5- Faridabad, for development and utilization of the notified land as residential and commercial purposes in Sector 45 of Faridabad under the Haryana Urban Development Authority Act, 1977. Almost all the petitioners in the writ petitions submitted their objections under Section 5-A of the Act. The appropriate Government, on consideration of the same, did not accept all the objections leading to the issuance of a notification under Section 6 of the Act on 1.8.1990 wherein a declaration was issued for acquisition of 184.66 acres of land meaning thereby that 10.31 acres of land was exempted from acquisition. Thereafter, notice under Section 9 of the Act was served on the petitioners on 15.1.1991 leading to the filing of the above-mentioned writ petitions praying therein for release of the constructed houses of the petitioners as had been released qua others for example residential houses constructed in Khasra No.14, 15/1 and 15/2 of rectangle No.50 as also of Chhote Lal and others, who have built their houses on the land comprising khasra No.22/2 of rectangle No.49. Houses constructed by Jamal and others on khasra No.18 of rectangle No.42 have also been exempted from acquisition. The petitioners have contended that they are similarly situated and have their built up houses in the same vicinity, but they have been discriminated against, thereby leading to violation of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. It has been pleaded that their objections have been wrongly rejected whereas the objections of similarly placed persons have been accepted and their residential houses have been released while the houses of the petitioners which are their only residential houses have been acquired. Accordingly, the petitioners have prayed for quashing of notifications dated 2.8.1989 and 1.8.1990 issued under Sections 4 and 6 of the Act respectively, as well as notice dated 15.1.1991 issued under Section -6- of the Act. State of Haryana has contested the claim of the petitioners; however, in reply to the assertions made by the petitioners with regard to the release of residential houses of similarly placed persons, no specific denial has been made of the assertions, except for that of Jamal and others as it has been stated that they had filed a writ petition in this Court but it has not been averred about any stay granted by this Court or the stage of the case. As regards the construction in some of the cases, the factum of there being C- class construction before issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act, has been admitted, while in some cases it has been pleaded that the acquired land which was having construction on it stands released. In some other cases, it has been stated that there was no construction on the land at the time of issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act. In two of the writ petitions, no reply has been filed wherein the petitioners have asserted that they have constructed their houses before the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act. It would not be out of way to mention here that the respondents have simply pleaded in the reply that the land of the petitioners has been acquired in accordance with the Act but it has not been pleaded that by exempting the land of the petitioners or releasing the same from acquisition, the purpose of the Land Acquisition Act would stand frustrated. Counsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners have with great difficulty constructed their residential houses in the land in question and have no other residential houses. If the petitioners are uprooted from the land at this stage, especially when residential houses of -7- similarly placed persons in the same vicinity stand exempted from acquisition while issuing notification under Section 6 of the Act, they would be rendered homeless. The petitioners also deserve the same treatment and are entitled to the said benefit. The respondents cannot be allowed to discriminate the petitioners without assigning any distinction between the claim of the petitioners and other similarly placed persons qua the same nature of land and structures. They further contend that the residential houses of the petitioners would in no manner impinge upon or infringe the object and purpose of acquisition, as the land is intended to be acquired for the purpose of residential and commercial development and utilization. They further contend that the writ petitions be allowed and the residential houses along with the land be exempted from acquisition. On the other hand, counsel for the respondents submits that the Government is entitled to acquire the land as well as built up houses. There is no bar with regard to acquisition of residential houses. All provisions as contained under the Land Acquisition Act have been fully complied with. On acquisition of the residential houses and the land of the petitioners, they would be paid adequate compensation in accordance with law and, therefore, they cannot make a grouse in this regard. He has, however, not been able to distinguish the claim of the petitioners for release of their residential houses, in any manner vis-a-vis. the houses of the land owners who have built up their residential houses in khasra Nos.14, 15/1 and 15/2 of rectangle No.50 as also Chhote Lal and others, who have built up their houses on the land comprising khasra No.2 of rectangle No.49, whose land has been exempted from notification under Section 6 of the Act. -8- We have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. The above-mentioned writ petitions require to be put in four different categories for proper consideration and effective decision of these cases. The first category cases are those wherein the petitioners have asserted that they had constructed their residential houses before the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act, which fact has been admitted by the respondents in their written statement. These writ petitions are C.W.P.Nos.1593, 1906, 1992, 1706, 1887, 2034 and 1929 of . Out of these cases, in some of the writ petitions, it has been asserted by the respondents that some rooms have been built up after the issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act by the petitioners. The second category of cases are those wherein it has been asserted by the petitioners that they had constructed their residential houses before the issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act but no written statement has been filed by the respondents. These are C.W.P.Nos.2036 and 1863 of 1991. The third category of cases would be cases where the factum of construction of the houses before issuance of the notification under Section of the Act has been admitted by the respondents. However, it has been stated that the constructed area stood already released. C.W.P.Nos.1994, and 1705 of 1991 belong to this category. The fourth category are the cases where although it has been asserted by the petitioners in their writ petitions that they had constructed their residential houses before the issuance of the notification under Section -9- of the Act but in the written statement filed by the State of Haryana, it has been asserted that there was no construction on the land when notification under Section 4 of the Act was issued. C.W.P.Nos.1704 of 1991, C.W.P.No.1905 of 1991 and C.W.P.No.2166 of 1991 are the cases in this category. In none of the cases, replication has been filed by the petitioners and, therefore, the facts as mentioned by the respondents in their written statement have not been controverted by the petitioners. There can be no dispute with regard to the assertion made by the counsel for the respondents that not only the land but also the structures on the land can be acquired under the Act. However, the decision of the State Government in not granting exemption from acquisition or releasing the land of a land owner arbitrarily and resorting to discriminatory approach qua similarly placed and situated land, would violate Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The case in hand is not the one where it is either the assertion of the petitioners or of the State Government that the exemption which has been granted to the similarly placed land owners, whose residential houses have been released from notification under Section 6 on consideration of the objections filed under Section 5-A of the Act, is in violation of the provisions of the Act or contrary to law with a mala fide intention to provide any benefit to those persons; neither is it a case where due to some mistake or result of a fraud or corrupt method, the land of the land owners has been exempted from notification. There is nothing, even remote to suggest that the land owners whose residential houses have been released have derived the benefit illegally. In such circumstances, the land owners, who are similarly -10- situated, have a right to receive similar treatment by the State Government. They cannot be discriminated against. All actions of the State have to be fair and for legitimate reasons. The State Government cannot pick and choose some land owners and exempt their land from acquisition and deny the same benefit to other similarly situated land owners. In the present case, the respondent-State has failed to give any explanation, what to say of reasonable one, with regard to the allegations of discrimination qua the residential houses of similarly placed land-owners. The specific pleadings in the writ petitions, mentioning the names of land owners, khasra and rectangle numbers whose residential houses in the same vicinity and area have been exempted/released from acquisition have not been denied by the respondents. Nor any reasons have been assigned for not releasing/exempting the land of the petitioners where their residential houses exist. This apparently leads to the conclusion that the respondent- State had not acted fairly and has discriminated with regard to the petitioners. It is also not the case of the respondents that the release of residential houses of the petitioners would frustrate the purpose of acquisition. It would not be out of way to mention here that the purpose of acquisition of the land is for residential and commercial development and utilization and what is being sought to be exempted by the petitioners are their only residential houses. A plea has been raised by the respondents that the rooms which have been constructed by the petitioners in most of the cases are of C-class construction whereas in some of the cases the same is of B-Class as well. However, that would not be relevant as the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sube Singh and others vs.",

This Civil Writ Petition is directed by the State of Haryana against the award dated 04.01.1990 (Annexure P9) passed by the Labour Court, Ambala City directing re-instatement of respondent No.1 with full backwages and continuity of service. (2). The first respondent was appointed as Electrician on work- charged basis at Hathnikund Barrage, Mech.Divn.No.1, Yamuna Nagar w.e.f. 14.11.1979. While the case of respondent No.1 was that his services were illegally terminated on 24.06.1981. (3). On the other hand, the plea taken by the petitioner- Department was that he had abandoned the employment. CWP No.3408 of 1990.doc - 2 (4). The Labour Court on appreciation of the evidence on record, came to the conclusion that it was not a case of abandonment of employment rather the first respondent was retrenched from service without complying with the provisions of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Consequential relief of re-instatement with backwages and continuity of service was granted. (5). It is the conceded position that in the absence of any ad interim stay order, the petitioner-Department reinstated respondent No.1 in service and even the backwages were also paid on his furnishing security to the satisfaction of the Labour Court as was directed vide order September, , 1991. (6). During the interregnum, the service of respondent No.1 has been regularized and is nearing the age of superannuation. (7). In these circumstances, I do not deem it appropriate to go into the merits of the impugned Award and dismiss the writ petition as infructuous, however, with a clarification that the impugned Award shall not be taken as binding precedent in the other cases.

Present: Shri Roshan Lal Sharma, Advocate for the petitioner. Shri G.S. Attariwala, Additional Advocate General, Punjab for the respondents. ORDER Surya Kant, J. - (Oral): The petitioner seeks a mandamus for finalization of the disciplinary proceedings pending against him and thereafter to grant him promotion, arrears of salary and other service benefits. While working as Senior Branch Officer with Markfed at Sangrur, the petitioner was served with a charge-sheet dated 24.4.1984 (Annexure P-1). Before that, the petitioner was placed under suspension on .9.1983 which was revoked vide order dated 28.1.1987. The petitioner submitted his reply to the charge-sheet. It further appears that besides the CWP No.2188 of 1991 -: 2 :- petitioner, some more employees were also charge-sheeted by the Markfed. An Inquiry Officer was appointed on 7.9.1984 to conduct a joint inquiry against all of them. It further appears that while the inquiry proceedings were near completion, one of the charge-sheeted employee (Harpal Singh) filed CWP No.114 of 1987 challenging the disciplinary proceedings initiated against him. No stay was, however, granted by this Court against the inquiry proceedings but passing of the final order was stayed. Meanwhile, the inquiry officer had submitted the report but no further action on that basis was taken against the petitioner or those employees in whose favour there was no interim order passed by this Court. In sum and substance, the petitioner wanted that the disciplinary proceedings should be finalized as he was expecting his exoneration, which would have made him entitled to claim the arrears of salary during the period he remained under suspension, as also consideration for further promotion. This writ petition was filed in the year 1992. More than 16 years have passed thereafter. There is every possibility that by now, the disciplinary proceedings have come to an end and whatever consequential benefits might have been found due, have also been released in favour of the petitioner. Be that as it may, having regard to the nature of relief sought in this writ petition, the same is disposed of with a direction to the Markfed to take a final decision in the disciplinary proceedings, if the same has not been taken so far, and if such a decision has already been taken and the petitioner has been exonerated, to consider his claim for all the consequential benefits including the promotion, arrears of pay, etc. as early CWP No.2188 of 1991 -: 3 :- as possible but not later than four months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order. These directions shall not be taken as an expression on the merits of the allegations levelled against the petitioner. December 22, 2008. [ Surya Kant ] kadyan Judge",

    "court": "-1- IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH Date of Decision:- 11.02.2009 Ashok Kumar and others ....Petitioner(s) vs. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Jalandhar and another ....Respondent(s) *** CORAM:- HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH *** Present:- Mr.Surinder Sharma, Advocate for the petitioners. Mr.P.K.Mutneja, Advocate for respondent No.2. *** AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. (Oral) In the present writ petition, challenge is to the award dated .3.1992 (Annexure P-9) vide which the Labour Court has come to the conclusion that the services of the workmen have not been terminated and they were very much the employees of the respondent-Management and, thus, the dispute as sought to be raised by the workmen did not exist as the enquiry proceedings were going on against them. Thus, the reference being pre-mature, it was answered against the workmen and in favour of the Management. Counsel for the petitioners contends that the Labour Court has gone beyond the reference. He contends that the reference was whether termination of services of the 23 workmen who had preferred a demand notice on which references were sent for adjudication to the Labour Court, -2- was justified and in order and if not, to what relief/exact amount of compensation each of them is entitled to. He contends that the Labour Court instead of adjudicating upon the reference made to it has proceeded to hold that there was no termination of the workmen and in view of this, the reference was pre-mature. He submits that the workmen had not been allowed to work in the factory and they were not allowed to enter the premises due to which they could not perform their duties. This would lead to only one conclusion that their services had been terminated by the Management. He submits that this termination was abrupt without holding any proper enquiry as neither any notice was given nor any charge-sheet was issued nor any retrenchment compensation paid to them. Therefore, he contends that the termination is not in accordance with law and the provisions governing the services of the workmen i.e. the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 have been violated with impunity. He relies upon the statements of the workmen to contend that they have categorically stated before the Labour Court that they have not been allowed to continue in service as they were not allowed to perform their duties. In this view of the matter, he submits that the award passed by the Labour Court cannot be sustained as the requirement of the reference was to adjudicate upon the issues as to whether the termination of the services of the workmen was in order and to what relief and amount of compensation they were entitled to. That having not been done, the present writ petition deserves to be allowed. He further relies upon an award dated 21.12.1992 (Annexure P-10) passed by the Labour Court, Jalandhar, of a co-worker wherein a reference preferred by a similarly situated employee had been answered in favour of the workmen although the same grounds which have been taken by the -3- employer as in the case of the petitioners were rejected by the Labour Court. He further contends that a writ petition preferred by the respondent- Management against this award i.e. C.W.P.No.7289 of 1993 was dismissed by a Division Bench of this Court on 12.1.1994. However, liberty was granted to the Management to proceed with the enquiry referred to in the award and to pass such order as it deemed appropriate in accordance with law. He, on this basis, presses that similar relief be granted to the petitioners. Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, contends that the present writ petition with regard to petitioners No.21 and 22 is not maintainable as both these workmen had not appeared before the Labour Court to support their assertions made in their demand notice. This factual position having not been disputed by the counsel for the petitioner, writ petition on behalf of petitioners No.21 and 22 Vas Dev, Typist Yashpal Singh, Turner respectively, is held to be not maintainable and dismissed as such on the ground that the Labour Court in its award itself has on this very ground answered the reference against these petitioners. Counsel for the respondent has further submitted that the award passed by the Labour Court is in accordance with law. He submits that before the Conciliation Officer the stand of the Management was that the workmen have been charge-sheeted and enquiry proceedings were pending against them and the record in that regard was also produced before the Conciliation Officer. He contends that the stand of the Management from the very inception was that the services of the workmen have not been terminated and since the workmen were still in service when the reference was made, there could have been no dispute under Section 10 of the Act. -4- After the said reference had been made by the Appropriate Government, the Labour Court on going through the records and the evidence led before it, has come to a conclusion that the reference was pre-mature on the ground that the termination of the workmen was not there. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and with their able assistance have gone through the records of the case as well as the impugned award. A perusal of the same would clearly show that MW-1 Shri Ranjit Singh, a Clerk of the local Labour Office, had appeared before the Labour Court and produced the records of the conciliation proceedings in the form of Exhibit M-1. Shri J.K.Sehgal, MW-2 had appeared before the Labour Court and produced various documents showing the charge-sheets and the notices issued to different workmen in relation to initiation of domestic enquiries against them. Even during the pendency of the proceedings before the Labour Court, it is apparent that the enquiries were pending before the workmen. The workmen in their cross-examination have admitted that show cause notices and charge-sheets regarding initiation of enquiries against them were either received by them or the said charge- sheets were dispatched on their correct addresses. However, this does indicate that the workmen were aware of the domestic enquiries being initiated and continuation thereof against them. Despite this knowledge, the workmen had proceeded to raise an industrial dispute claiming therein that their services have been terminated. The finding as recorded by the Labour Court, therefore, cannot be faulted with that the reference was pre-mature as the services of the workmen were not terminated on the date(s) alleged by them or on the date(s) when the reference was made. That being so, the only conclusion which can be arrived at and has rightly been reached by the -5- Labour Court is that the reference was pre-mature. That being the position, no illegality can be said to have been committed by the Labour Court in passing Award dated 21.12.1992 (Annexure P-9). The contention of the counsel for the petitioners that in the case of similarly placed employees, the reference has been answered in favour of the workmen and against the Management although the grounds taken therein were on the same lines as in the present proceedings. A perusal of the said award ( Annexure P-10) would show that the Court has proceeded to decide the case as per the pleadings before the said Court. This order, when challenged before this Court in C.W.P.No.7289 of 1993 which came to be decided on 12.1.1994, this order also says that the enquiries which has been referred to in the award were still continuing against the workmen and the Court has also given liberty to the Management to proceed with the enquiries and to pass such orders as it deems appropriate in accordance with law. This further shows that as a matter of fact, there was no termination in that case as well. However, this Court in exercise of its discretionary powers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India refrained itself from exercising its writ jurisdiction. In view of the above, the present writ petition is without any merit and is hereby dismissed. However, a liberty is given to the Management to proceed in accordance with the findings, if any, against the workmen. February 11, 2009",

The High Court held the teachers entitled to the benefit of the revised grade, whether or not they had been appointed as Masters, because, in the opinion of the High Court, the qualifying criterion was the possession of a graduate degree. The judgment of the High Court was affirmed by this Court in Kirpal Singh Bhatia (AIR 1976 SC 2459) (supra). The State Government found it difficult, having regard to the prevailing burden on its financial resources, to extend the benefit of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 to the much wider section of teachers covered in consequence of the Court's judgment.

A perusal of the record of Civil Writ Petition No.942 of 1993 shows that order dated 24.9.1993 was set aside by the Hon'ble Apex Court and the case was remitted to this Court to reconsider the matter, which was pertaining to the grant of full pay scale of office -2- *** Superintendent to the petitioner on the basis of equal pay for equal work. The said writ petition was thereafter dismissed as withdrawn on .12.2009. .

At the instance of the revenue, the Tribunal has referred identical question of law for the opinion of this Court by exercising jurisdiction under Section 256(1) of the Income-tax Act, (for brevity, the Act ). The question of law framed in ITR No. of 1996 reads as under:- Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that the share income attributable to 40% of the assessee s right, title and interest of her share income in M/s Munjal Gases was to be excluded from the assessee s total income? . At the outset, learned counsel for the revenue has fairly stated that the above mentioned question of law has already been answered by this Court against the revenue and in favour of the assessee in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (Central) Ludhiana v. Pawan Kant (ITR No. 7 of 1989, Assessment Year 1981- , decided on 30.8.2004).

The plea of the revenue that there must be atleast two male members to form a HUF as taxable entity was specifically rejected.

Shri Rajiv Kwatra, Senior D.A.G. Haryana. MAHESH GROVER, J. The petitioner in this petition prays that the service rendered by him on work charge basis followed by regularization be considered for grant of pensionary benefits. The petitioner joined the services of the State of Punjab, P.W.D. B&R Branch on 15.1.1947 as Lower Divisional Clerk and was subsequently promoted as Senior Clerk and Accounts Clerk. He continued to serve in the State of Punjab prior to its re-organization and subsequently worked with the State of Himachal Pradesh with effect from 1.11.1966 till 14.8.1967 when he resigned from there. He then joined services of the State of Haryana on 4.2.1971 as C.W.P. No.8674 of 1994 -2- Accounts Clerk-cum-Store Munshi as a work charged employee. On 2.6.1983 the petitioner retired on attaining the age of superannuation. In the backdrop of the aforesaid facts, the petitioner has prayed for grant of pensionary benefits which have been declined to him, and as a justification thereof, the respondents have stated in their reply that the petitioner was brought on the regular rolls of the Department of P.W.D.(B&R), but the order of regularization could not be implemented because the petitioner failed to submit himself for the medical examination which was the requirement. The date of regularization attributed to the petitioner is 28.8.1980 which is also evident from Annexure R-1. The solitary ground on which the prayer of the petitioner has been declined, has been noticed above i.e. the order of regularization not being implemented on account of non-cooperation of the petitioner who failed to submit himself for medical examination. I have considered the matter and am of the opinion that the petition deserves to be accepted. The petitioner has concededly worked as a work charge employee with the respondents. His services were regularized on 28.8.1980 and he retired from the Department in 1983 on attaining the age of superannuation. Merely because he did not get himself medically examined, would not rob him of the benefit of regularization more particularly so, when he continued to serve the respondents in the year 1983 i.e. 3 years after the date of regularization. The periods rendered by him as work charge employee prior to regularization would therefore, need to be counted for the purposes of pension keeping in view the observations of a Full Bench of this Court in Kesar Chand v. State of Punjab Through the Secretary, P.W.D. B&R, Chandigarh and others 1988(5) S.L.R. 27. The writ petition is therefore, accepted and the respondents are directed to count the service rendered by the petitioner as work charge employee C.W.P. No.8674 of 1994 -3- for the purpose of pension. The needful be done within four months from today and the benefits be released within two months.

This writ petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of India has been filed with a prayer to quash the orders dated December 31, (Annexure P-8), August 1, 1985 (Annexure P-10) passed by respondent Nos.1 and 2 respectively, vide which the land measuring .60 square metres in possession of the petitioners situated in Rakh Shikargarh Area on GT Road Bye-pass near junction of Fatehgarh Churian Road, Amritsar, was declared surplus in purported exercise of the powers conferred under Section 10(1) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 (Central Act No.33 of 1976) Needless to say that the impugned orders dated December 31, (Annexure P-8) and August 1, 1985 (Annexure P-10) were also -2- passed under the afore-stated 1976 Act only. Vide order dated November 6, 1985 this writ petition was admitted and was ordered to be heard along with Civil Writ Petition No.2244 of 1985 but no stay was given to the petitioner qua the afore- mentioned land which was declared surplus with them. The case was taken up for final hearing on July 14, 2004, when it was brought to the notice of the Court that the counsel for the petitioners had died. The Registry was accordingly directed to send notices to the petitioners for September 29, 2004. In response thereto, the office reported that petitioners No.1 & 2 (Kishanchand Savlani and Smt.Ratna Savlani) have died. Thereafter Civil.Misc.Nos.19122 and 19150 of 2005 were moved for impleading the legal representatives of the deceased petitioners No.1 and 2. The same were allowed vide order dated February 03, 2006 and petitioner No.3-being the sole legal heir of petitioner Nos.1 and 2, was ordered to be impleaded as their legal representative. It is fairly conceded by Shri B.S.Baath, learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab, that the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 has since been repealed vide the Central Ordinance No.5 of 1999 with effect from 22.3.1999 as has been notified by the Government of Punjab, Department of Housing and Urban Development vide their notification No.7/1/99-3HGI-1899 dated 30.5.2000. As a result thereof, the proceedings under the 1976 Act have come to an end in the State of Punjab. In their written reply dated 8.2.2007 filed on behalf of respondent Nos.1 and 2, it is not disputed that notwithstanding the declaration of excess area under the repealed Act of 1976, the petitioners -3- continue to retain possession of the subject property. Since the Act has been repealed during the pendency of this writ petition and the proceedings initiated thereunder have not yet attained finality and the possession of the properties also remained with the petitioner, in my view, further proceedings under the afore-mentioned Act no longer survive and stand lapsed, particularly when no saving clause of any kind in the Repealing Act has been brought to the notice of this Court. As a necessary consequence, the action which culminated into passing of the impugned orders dated December 31, 1984 and August 1, 1985 (Annexures P-8 and P-10) has also lost legal back-up rendering the same in- operative. Shri M.L.Saggar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner also accepts the legal and factual position that no cause of action survives in favour of the petitioner after repealing of the 1976 Act as the orders passed thereunder having become inoperative. Consequently and in view of the stand taken by learned Assistant Advocate General, Punjab, as stated above, this writ petition has been rendered infructuous and is disposed of accordingly. No costs.

JUSTICE RAJAN GUPTA Present: Mr. B.S. Wasu, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. O.P. Dabala, Deputy Advocate General, Punjab. RAJAN GUPTA J. (ORAL) This is a petition under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India praying for writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing the order dated .07.1987, Anneuxre P-2 passed by Sub Divisional Officer (Civil) Sangrur while exercising the power of Appellate Authority under the Punjab Municipal Act, 1911. The assessment in question relates to residential property situated within the municipal limits of Sangrur. The property is stated to be owned by respondent No. 2. At the time of assessment of house tax, a notice was issued to him by Executive Officer, Muncipal Committee, Sangrur. After hearing the objections, the annual rental value was determined at Rs. 3000/- for the rented portion and Rs. 3,000/- for self occupied portion vide assessment order dated 28.01.1987 (Annexure P-1). Respondent No. 2 appealed against the said order before the Sub-Divisional Officer (Civil), Sangrur. But after hearing the parties, Sub-Divisional Officer (Civil) observed that no portion of house was let-out. He, thus, set-aside the assessment order in so far it pertained to portion purportedly let out and reduced the assessment in respect of self occupied portion from Rs. 3,000/- to Rs. 28,00/-. Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the order passed by the appellate authority is unsustainable. According to him, the authority could not have exempted the rented portion from assessment of house tax. He has also assailed the finding of appellate court to the effect that house was not rented out. Learned counsel, therefore, prays that matter may be remanded back to the same authority for decision afresh. No reply has been filed on behalf of the respondents. The prayer for remand is, however, not opposed by learned State counsel. I have heard counsel for the parties and given careful thought to the facts of the case. From the order passed by appellate authority, it is not clear whether the assessment order was passed in respect of entire residential property in question or part thereof, nor is it specified how a finding of fact was arrived at by the appellate authority that the house was not rented out. Under the circumstances, this court accepts the prayer made by counsel for the parties that the matter be remanded back to the same authority for decision afresh. Resultantly, impugned order dated 24.07.1987, Annexure P-2 passed by appellate authority is hereby set-aside. The matter is remitted back to the same authority for taking a fresh decision after hearing the parties. The parties are directed to remain present before the appellate authority on 05.03.2010. With the above said observations, the writ petition is allowed. January 27, 2010 (RAJAN GUPTA) Ajay JUDGE",

Rajesh Bindal J. The State has filed the present appeal against the award of the learned court below passed under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, 'the Act') seeking reduction in the compensation for the acquired land. Briefly, the facts of the case are that the State of Haryana vide notification dated 10.1.1983 issued under Section 4 of the Act, acquired the land situated in revenue estate of Village Jharsa, Tehsil and District Gurgaon, for the development and utilisation thereof for residential and commercial purpose at Gurgaon. The Land Acquisition Collector assessed the market value of different kinds of land at different rates. On reference under Section 18 of the Act, the learned court below determined the market value of the acquired land which is situated in the rear portion to the National Highway at ` 68/- per square yard and for the land which is within the depth of ten yards from National Highway at ` /- per square yard. Learned State counsel very fairly conceded that the claim made in the appeal is squarely covered against the State by judgment of this court in RFA No. 2868 of 1992- Balai Ram and others vs State of Haryana and another, decided on 19.11.2008, whereby award of the Reference Court was upheld. Accordingly, the claim made in the present appeal does not survive. For the reasons recorded in Balai Ram's case (supra), the present appeal is dismissed. .7.2010. ( Rajesh Bindal) vs.",

Ms.Meenakshi Verma, Additional A.G. Haryana. Shri Atul Lakhanpal, Senior Advocate with Shri Arjun Lakhanpal, Advocate. MAHESH GROVER, J. The petitioner impugns the order of his retrenchment. He was working as a Technical Supervisor with respondent No.2. i.e. the Haryana State Small Industries & Export Corporation Ltd. when he along with other similarly situated persons faced retrenchment. The rentrechment was necessitated on account of the closure of the Corporation which fact is controverted by the counsel for the respondents who contends that only one unit was closed. This plea of the petitioner has been vehemently controverted by the respondents who has asserted that the entire Corporation had since been closed and its operations wound up. C.W.P. No.732 of 1992 -2- There is no such material on record from where it can be inferred that the Corporation has been wound up. But the counsel for the petitioner certainly admits that one unit of the Corporation has been closed. There is no order to this effect also on record. So even if the statement of the counsel for the petitioner is accepted to be correct, then also there is nothing on record to show that a rehabilitation policy was formulated by the respondents to adjust the retrenched employees. It was incumbent for the petitioner to place on record such a policy in the event of seeking such a benefit therefrom. In the absence of any such material, this Court has been precluded from evaluating as to whether the petitioner was entitled to rehabilitation more particularly when it has been shown by the respondents that the Corporation or a part thereof employing the petitioner is no longer in existence. Apart from that, even if the best case of the petitioner is accepted, he would have been entitled to adjustment as per the policy, if any and this would have made him entitled to a benefit which today can be termed to be illusory, as he would not have got any monetary benefits from the respondents on account of such an adjustment on the principle of 'no pay for no work'. For all intents and purposes, the instant petition has been rendered infructuous as the petitioner who preferred the petition, has expired and the writ petition is being prosecuted by his legal representatives. For the aforesaid reasons, the writ petition is dismissed as having become infructuous. (MAHESH GROVER) July 23, 2013",

JUSTICE PERMOD KOHLI Present: Mr.RK Malik, Senior Advocate, with Ms.Renu Chaudhary, Advocate. Mr.RKS Brar, Addl. AG, Haryana. PERMOD KOHLI, J. (Oral): Heard the learned counsel for the parties at length. The facts are taken from CWP No.3223 of 1988. These petitions have been filed challenging the order passed by the Director, Higher Education, Haryana, Chandigarh, CWP No.3223 of 1988 2 withdrawing the interim benefit earlier granted to the petitioners and consequential recovery. It appears that the petitioners working in various schools were granted benefit of interim relief with effect from .12..1985 on the pattern of the University Grants Commission Grades. The first instalment was released and thereafter on consideration of the matter, the impugned order dated 12.5.1987, Annexure P-3 (in CWP No.3223 of 1988) has been passed withdrawing the benefit/relief and the excess amount is sought to be recovered. In the reply filed by the respondents it is stated that on the basis of the letters dated 2.8.1983 and 29..4.1985 issued from the Government of India, on the recommendation of 4th Pay Commission, the Government of Haryana sanctioned two instalments of interim relief. After disbursement of the first instalment and at the time of the disbursement of the second instalment, it came to the notice of the authorities that the payment has been made in violation of the instructions Annexure P-2. On that basis, impugned order came to be passed. Mr.RK Malik, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioners submits that he has instructions to say that the petitioners do not dispute the refixation of their pay or withdrawal of the benefit, but confine relief only to the recovery part. From the reply, it appears neither fraud nor misrepresentation is attributed to the petitioners. It was only on the basis of the interpretation of the government instructions that the CWP No.3223 of 1988 3 amount was paid to the petitioners. The issue involved in the present writ petitions is squarely covered by a Full Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Budh Ram and others Vs. State of Haryana and others (CWP No.2799 of 2009) decided on 22.5.2009 wherein the following observations have been made:- We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that in case the employees who are recipient of the benefits extended to them on an erroneous interpretation or application of any rule, regulation, circular and instructions have not been any way contributed to such erroneous interpretation or have they committed any fraud, misrepresentation, deception to obtain the grant of such benefit, the benefit so extended may be stopped for the future, but the amount already paid to the employees cannot be recovered from them. In view of the above, the present writ petitions are partly allowed while upholding the refixation/withdrawal of the relief, the recovery against the petitioners is hereby quashed. If any recovery pursuant to the impugned orders is made from the petitioners, the same shall be refunded to them within a period of four months. No costs. A copy of this order be placed on the record of each connected file. .01.2010 (PERMOD KOHLI) BLS JUDGE CWP No.3223 of 1988 4",

Respondent CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN ***** Present:- Mr. Mahataj Bakhsh Singh, Advocate for the appellant. K. Kannan, J (oral) 1. The Insurance Company is in appeal against the judgment of the MACT contending that in spite of the fact that the driver who drove the vehicle was proved to have had a fake driving licence, the liability is wrongly cast on it. . The liability of the Insurance Co in a case of a fake licence or a renewal of a licence which was a fake one have been considered by the Hon ble Supreme Court in several cases and the decisions in National Insurance Co v Swaran Singh (2004) 3 SCC 297 and United Indian Insurance v Divinder Singh (2007) 8 SCC 342 are instructive. In the latter judgment, it has been held that a renewal of a fake driving licence is no licence at all and hence the insurer shall not be liable. . It was even held earlier by the Hon ble Supreme Court, while referring to the effect of a renewal of forged licence, in New India Assurance Co., Shimla v. Kamla,(2001) 4 SCC 342: . The observation of the Division Bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sucha -2 Singh that renewal of a document which purports to be a driving licence, will robe even a forged document with validity on account of Section 15 of the Act, propounds a very dangerous proposition. If that proposition is allowed to stand as a legal principle, it may, no doubt, thrill counterfeiters the world over as they would be encouraged to manufacture fake documents in a legion. What was originally a forgery would remain null and void forever and it would not acquire legal validity at any time by whatever process of sanctification subsequently done on it. Forgery is antithesis to legality and law cannot afford to validate a forgery. . The judgment of the Supreme Court in Swaran Singh (supra) has an immediate relevance for us in this case for the effect of proof of fake licence in the context of the need for discharging the burden of proof on the Insurance company that the insured had committed a breach of terms of the policy. The fact that the driver had a fake licence will absolve the insurer of the liability of the insurer only, if it is established that the accident was on account of reasons where the possession of valid driving licence will have relevance for consideration of the aspect of negligence that has to be proved. If the accident was on account of say, mechanical defect in the vehicle, the issue of the validity of licence will have no relevance. . In this case, the driver has not examined himself and there is no evidence about the licence except the copy of the driving licence, which is produced and whose genuineness has been the subject of evidence through an officer of the licensing authority with reference to the official document. The owner has remained ex parte and no evidence is available about his bonafides of enquiry regarding the possession of driving licence by the driver before its entrustment to him. Consequently, the insured shall not have the benefit of indemnity under the policy. . Even if the insurance company is not liable, the -3 duty to satisfy the award for the claimants cannot be doubted. In such a situation, the liability to satisfy the award will be accompanied with a right of recovery from the owner/insured. This cannot be doubted in anyway, as specifically provided by the decision of the Supreme Court while dealing with the effect of proviso to section 149(4) and section (5) of the M.V.Act in New India Assurance co v Kamla",

ORDER Surya Kant, J. - This Appeal has been filed by the wife against the judgment dated 3.6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhatinda whereby a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for short the Act) on the ground of cruelty and desertion, preferred by the respondent husband, has been accepted and their marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce. [2]. The marriage between the parties was solemnized on 19.2.1973 at Patiala. At the time when the subject divorce petition was filed by the husband on 21.10.1991, they had three male children born out of the wedlock and they were about 18, 16 and 12 years of age respectively. In his -: 2 :- petition, the respondent alleged that the behaviour of the appellant towards the respondent and his old mother was indifferent from the very beginning; that she is suffering from some sort of mental disorder with the result that she refused to cook meals for him and the minor children; that she levelled false allegations qua the character of the respondent; that she gave severe beatings to the mother of the respondent on 22.9.1990 and that as a result thereof, he filed a divorce petition in which the appellant allegedly made a statement on 13.3.1991 that she will not misbehave in future with the respondent or his mother and undertook not to file any complaints against him either to the police or to the higher authorities of the Board; that the matter was compromised and the petition for dissolution of the marriage was withdrawn. [3]. The respondent has further averred that soon after the above stated compromise, the appellant allegedly refused to honour her words and started making false and frivolous complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda alleging that she had fear for her life at the hands of the respondent. The respondent alleged that he along with the children has been forced to live in the small rented house and that he has a vast circle of friends but the appellant allegedly refused to look after the visitors and forced the respondent to cook meals, clean utensils and wash the clothes of the children also . This fact was allegedly noticed by the relatives and friends of the respondent who used to visit the house thereby causing great mental cruelty to him as the respondent's reputation stood blotted. It was further alleged that the appellant in connivance with her father broke open the locks of the house which is under the possession of his mother and valuable articles were removed.... . It was also alleged that -: 3 :- the appellant threatened the respondent to get him physically liquidated . On the strength of these allegations, the respondent sought dissolution of their marriage by a decree of divorce. [4]. The appellant contested the above stated petition vide her reply dated 16.12.1992 and took a preliminary objection that the respondent in fact was taking advantage of his own wrongs as it was he who subjected her to cruelty even though she wanted to lead a honorable life with him. The appellant specifically averred that the respondent has deserted her with ulterior motive and has declined to give food and shelter . On merits, the appellant took the plea that soon after their marriage, the respondent started harassing her for bringing insufficient dowry and did not even attend the marriage of her brother held in the year 1974. She alleged that till the time her father-in-law was alive, the respondent used to behave reasonably well, however, after his death in the year 1978, he started beating her mercilessly and on many occasions refused to provide food or woolen clothes during winters. It was alleged that for the last over five years, the respondent has been continuously beating her so badly and ruthlessly that it has also affected her eye sight. She denied the allegations that she refused to cook food for the respondent, their children or her mother-in-law or that she ever made any false complaints against the respondent to the authorities. In para of the written statement, the appellant specifically alleged that in fact the respondent desired to re-marry and wanted to get rid of her . She further alleged that the previous divorce petition was withdrawn by the respondent after stating that he had compromised the matter and shall not beat her and will behave properly in future. In fact the divorce petition was withdrawn by him to avoid maintenance pendente-lite and litigation expenses. The -: 4 :- appellant specifically averred that she never refused to accompany the respondent, rather it is he who refused to take the respondent to his home . She further averred that since the respondent wanted to turn her out of the matrimonial home, he himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813 Bhatinda and thereafter got filed eviction application against her from his mother alleging therein that she was a tenant in the house. The appellant admitted that she had to approach the Deputy Commissioner Bhatinda as her life and liberty was at stake for the reason that the respondent sent hired unsocial elements at midnight at her residence on 2nd May, 1991 and 4th May, 1991 who was later on caught by the neighbours and was given severe beatings. Fortunately, her father was with her at that time. [5]. In his rejoinder, the respondent husband not only reiterated the allegations, he further averred that since he refused to pay Rs.25,000/- to the brother of the appellant who wanted to expand his business of welding material, she became totally arrogant and threatened him that she will take revenge later on. Admitting the poor eye sight of the appellant, the respondent averred that she is suffering from an inherited disease.... which cannot be cured.... . He denied the allegations that he wanted to re-marry. [6]. On the basis of the pleadings, following issues were framed by the learned trial court:- 1. Whether respondent has deserted the petitioner without any sufficient and reasonable cause? OPA . Whether the respondent is guilty of cruelty as alleged in the petition? OPA . Whether the respondent is entitled to special costs as -: 5 :- alleged in the written statement? OPR . Whether the petitioner has no cause of action and locus standi to file the petition? . Relief. [7]. In order to discharge his onus qua issues No.1 and 2, the respondent examined formal witnesses Prem Kumar (AW1), who is a record-keeper in the Sessions Division at Bhatinda and produced the file of previous divorce petition HMA No.35 dated 28.9.1990 decided on .3.1991 as well as Surjit Singh (AW2), who being Reader to the Court of Additional District Judge Bhatinda on 13.3.1991, had recorded the statements of the parties. The respondent also examined Om Parkash (AW3), ASI Kashmir Singh (AW4), Uzagar Singh (AW5), Amrik Singh (AW6), Constable Dalbir Singh (AW7), Head Constable Gurcharan Kaur (AW8), respondent, himself as (AW9) and Madan Lal Sharma (AW10) and also relied upon documents Ex.A1 to A8. [8]. The appellant, on the other hand, examined her brother Amar Nath Gupta (RW1) and she herself entered the witness box as (RW2). She also relied upon the documents Ex.R1 to R6. [9]. Upon appreciation of the above stated evidence and while deciding the issues No.1 and 2 together, the learned Additional District Judge held that the appellant refused to prepare tea for the visitors, she often abused her husband and made false complaints against him to the police and his colleagues/superiors. The appellant's statement dated 13.3.1991 (Ex.A1) in the previous divorce petition, which was compromised, has also been relied upon to arrive at the aforesaid conclusion. The learned trial court also placed reliance upon Ex.A4, a report alleged to have been made by HC -: 6 :- Gurcharan Kaur and concluded that, there is no rebuttal to documentary evidence of the petitioner regarding the alleged cruelty by the respondent and that the appellant only wanted to extract money from the petitioner by filing various petitions and applications before the police . The learned trial court held that it was a case of causing 'mental cruelty' to the husband who made every effort to join the respondent in his company . The learned trial court further held that the appellant-wife has deserted the respondent without any sufficient and reasonable cause... . Both the issues were accordingly answered against the appellant, resulting into passing of the impugned judgment and decree. [10]. I have heard Learned Counsel for the parties, perused the pleadings, the impugned judgment as well as the evidence on record. [11]. Before adverting to issue No.2, i.e., whether or not the respondent is guilty of cruelty as alleged in the petition , I firstly propose to deal with issue No.1, as to whether she had deserted the respondent without any sufficient and reasonable cause? . [12]. If one reads the petition under Section 13 of the Act dated .10.1991 , it is evident in unequivocal terms that no allegations, what-so- ever, that the appellant ever deserted her husband without any sufficient cause, have been made. The entire petition is founded upon the allegations of cruelty and it is in that process that the respondent in para 8 of the petition has averred that he along with his sons, who are studying in Convent School and DAV College, Bhatinda respectively, have been forced to live in the small rented house . No averment that the appellant voluntarily left her matrimonial home and, thus, deserted the respondent, has been made. In the absence of such allegations, how issue No.1 was -: 7 :- framed, is beyond comprehension. Be that as it may, it is the admitted fact that house no.3880, Neeta Street, behind Gurdwara Singh Sabha, Bhatinda is owned by the respondent or his mother. The parties were admittedly residing in the said house only, as the respondent himself gave the same address for both the parties in his first divorce petition No. HMA35 dated .9.1990. The parties were, thus, residing under the same roof not only in the year 1990 but also at the time when they compromised their matrimonial dispute on 13.3.1991. In para 6 of her written statement, the appellant wife has specifically averred that the respondent husband himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813 Bhatinda . This fact has been admitted by the respondent in para 8 of the divorce petition though in a different manner. Not only this, the appellant admittedly continues to stay in the same house owned by the respondent or his mother even though the respondent attempted to throw her out by getting an eviction petition filed through his mother. The appellant's specific stand that an eviction petition was filed by her mother-in-law alleging her to be a tenant in the premises, has not been controverted by the respondent in his rejoinder. If that is so, the conclusion drawn by the learned trial court that the appellant has deserted her husband without any sufficient cause is totally contrary to the evidence on record. It is the respondent who concededly left the matrimonial home and shifted to a rented accommodation. The finding returned by the learned trial court on issue No.1, therefore, cannot sustain and is accordingly set aside. [13]. This takes us to the crucial issue as to who out of the two subjected the other to cruelty of such a high degree that the matrimonial tie had to be snapped by a decree of divorce. -: 8 :- [14]. At the cost of repetition, it may be noticed that in order to prove the allegation of cruelty at the hands of the appellant, the respondent has alleged that she (i) refused to cook meals for the family; (ii) levelled false allegations on the character of the respondent; (iii) gave beatings to the mother of the respondent; (iv) admitted these allegations in her statement on .3.1991 in the previous divorce petition when she said that she will not misbehave in future; (v) moved false and frivolous complaints to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda; (vi) in connivance with her father, broke open the locks of the house and removed the valuables; and (vii) threatened the petitioner to get him physically liquidated. [15]. To prove the above reproduced first allegation, the respondent in addition to his own statement, has examined Om Parkash (AW3). The said witness has deposed that whenever he visited the house of the petitioner and he requested the respondent to prepare tea, she refused for all the times . He, however, has admitted that he did not know as to whether the respondent used to prepare meals for her husband, mother-in-law and children as according to the witness, he did not sit in the house all the times . The statement of this witness inspires no confidence at all. He was a family friend of the respondent. No date, month or year of his alleged visit to the house of the respondent has been disclosed by him. A sweeping statement by an interested witness, which is totally vague in nature, cannot be termed as a reliable evidence. So far as the respondent's own version is concerned, no credence can be given to the same as it would be revealed that he was hellbent on throwing the appellant out of her matrimonial home on one pretext or the other. The second instance of cruelty is sought to be substantiated through Uzagar Singh (AW5) who has deposed that the -: 9 :- appellant used to abuse the respondent. In his cross examination, he had to concede that he did not remember as to when did he visit the residence of the parties. He admits that the appellant visited his residence and complained that her husband is not paying any maintenance nor keeping her with him . If those were the state of affairs that the appellant wife had to rush to one family friend or the other for her sustenance, how could the appellant be held guilty of subjecting the respondent to cruelty? The other witness Amrik Singh (AW6) - a Junior Engineer is also a colleague of the respondent. While he claims that the appellant used to go to the office of the XEN/SDO for making complaints against her husband and used to utter obnoxious remarks against him, he admits having no knowledge as to whether or not the respondent provided food and clothing to his wife and/or paid maintenance. Interestingly, the complaint (Ex.A8) produced by Constable Dalbir Singh is a complaint made by the mother of the respondent against the appellant before the SSP, Bhatinda. How on the earth the said document could be relied upon against the appellant to establish the alleged cruelty by her towards the respondent, is beyond any legal fiction. The learned trial court, however, has taken these self-serving complaints made by the respondent or his mother also as an evidence against the appellant. [16]. This takes us to the third incident, namely, a complaint by the appellant to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda. The appellant has candidly admitted in her written statement as well as in her deposition that she made a complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda. She has, however, given a specific reason, namely, that in the midnight of 2.5.1991 and 4.5.1991 respectively, the respondent sent an unsocial element hired by him to her residence who was caught and thrashed by the neighbours. -: 10 :- Fortunately, the father of the appellant was staying with her during those days. The respondent has not been able to dispute this occurrence specifically. Had she been all alone, any untoward incident could have taken place. In these circumstances when the respondent was adopting all sorts of dubious means to brow-beat and terrorize the appellant so as to force her to vacate the house of his mother, what sin the appellant had committed by approaching the district administration for the protection of her life and liberty? This was a lawful action taken by her, which, with no stretch of imagination, can be termed as an act of cruelty on her part. [17]. Adverting to the allegation that the appellant gave beatings to the mother of the respondent, firstly, no evidence of causing such beatings, like medico-legal report, etc. has been brought on record. No independent person, who might have witnessed such an incident, has come forward to depose. Even the mother of the respondent has not come and deposed. Not only this, the eldest child of the parties was 18 years old when the divorce petition was filed. Even he could have been produced to depose the truth. In the absence of an iota of evidence, no reliance on the bald statement of the respondent, can be placed. There is no other evidence to support the allegation that the respondent was ever subjected to cruelty by the appellant. The conclusion drawn by the learned trial court on issue No.2 is also, thus, contrary to the evidence on record and is, therefore, reversed. [18]. There are, however, more than one reason to hold that the respondent founded his petition upon totally false allegations and it is rather he who has subjected the appellant with extreme cruelty. The evidence on record does suggest that she was physically tortured and has been deprived of basic necessities for survival and to live with dignity. She has lost her -: 11 :- eye sight due to cruel and callous attitude of the respondent who could not muster the strength to deny the said truth though has sought to explain that the appellant was not taken for treatment, as she was suffering from an incurable hereditary disease . It cannot be overlooked that it was a case where the marriage was solemnized long back in the year 1973. No fault was found with the appellant's behaviour when three children were sired and they grew up enough to look after themselves independently. It is thereafter only that the respondent started finding consistent faults with the appellant. From the zimni orders passed by the learned trial court, it is apparent that the respondent has been adopting one or the other unsavory means to delay or deny the payment of maintenance to the appellant. She was forced to visit the offices of higher authorities of the respondent as well as his friends in order to persuade him to pay maintenance to her. The fact that the respondent also got filed an 'eviction petition' through his mother to render the appellant homeless, is yet another strong circumstance to exhibit his vengeance against the appellant. [19]. The appellant's allegation that the respondent himself left the matrimonial home as he did not want to live with her, is further proved by the fact that on 28.8.1993, the divorce petition was put before the Lok Adalat where he compromised the matter and agreed to take the appellant with him. He, however, turned around and later on made a statement that the situation has changed and he is not ready to keep her . It is also on record that even for the recovery of the arrears of maintenance, the appellant was forced to file a civil suit. [20]. For the reasons afore-stated, the impugned judgment dated .6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, being contrary to -: 12 :- the facts and evidence on record, is liable to be set aside. [21]. The matter, however, is not as simple as to be rested here. The parties were married in the year 1973. They have been admittedly living separately since the year 1991. Their children have grown up and are married. In order to find out an amicable solution, their eldest son was also asked to be present in Court. He did come. The parties were heard in person also. The appellant is in a pitiable condition. She has almost turned blind and is now confined to a one room accommodation, which is stated to be in a dilapidated condition. The respondent has refused to carry out the necessary repairs even when the appellant's right to residence is a part and parcel of her right to maintenance. (Ref: B.P. Achala Anand v. S. Appi Reddy, (2005)3 SCC 313) She cannot spare money out of a meagre amount of Rs.600/- which she is getting as maintenance pendente-lite. Though the appellant's suit for recovery was decreed by both the courts below, however, the Regular Second Appeal preferred by the respondent was admitted and operation of those judgments was stayed. She, thus, could not recover even a penny from the respondent. In these peculiar circumstances, the intervention of the parties' son was sought but he too expressed his helplessness in resolving the dispute. As the respondent took a categoric stand not to take the appellant to her matrimonial home in any circumstance, the appellant was persuaded and she reluctantly agreed to part ways on payment of a reasonable and respectable lump-sum amount, a part of which she urgently requires for her eyes' surgery and repair of the one room house. This was also not acceptable to the respondent. [22]. As the parties are living separately from the last 15 years and the bad blood against each other is still boiling hot, it is undoubtedly a case -: 13 :- of irretrievably broken marriage. The parties are at a point of no-return. While the respondent cannot encash his own misdeeds, the appellant also need not be foisted upon him at this stage as he is not ready to accept her for the re-beginning of their married life. The solution to such a dilemma lies in the principles enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohni, 2006(4) SCC 558. Applying the dictum laid therein and keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, as noticed above, I uphold the decree of divorce not on the ground of 'cruelty' or 'desertion' as granted by the learned trial court, rather after holding that it is a case of irrepairable broken marriage. The marriage is totally dead and has ceased to exist. The parties have no sentiments for each other. The decree of divorce, granted by the trial court, therefore, is kept intact subject to, however, the condition that the respondent husband shall pay a total sum of Rs.5 lacs to the appellant within a period of six months, i.e., a sum of Rs.1 lacs shall be paid by him within one month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order and the remaining four lacs in two equal installments of Rs.2 lacs each, the first one to be paid two months after the payment of Rs.1 lac and the balance amount of Rs.2 lacs shall be paid by him in another three months thereafter. [23]. The lump-sum amount has been awarded after taking notice of the fact that the respondent has not only got lacs of rupees towards retiral benefits, he, along with his sons, is also running flourishing business including an industrial unit. He is, thus, financially sound and capable to part with the aforesaid amount. [24]. However, if the respondent fails to pay the afore-stated amount to the appellant within the prescribed time schedule, in that event the appeal -: 14 :- shall stand allowed and as a result thereof the judgment and decree dated .6.1993 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhatinda would be taken to have been set aside with costs of Rs.15,000/-.

JUSTICE ADARSH KUMAR GOEL HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AJAI LAMBA Present: Mr. VK Sandhir, Advocate, for the petitioners. Mr. Har Simran Singh Sethi, Advocate for Caveators. JUDGMENT: This petition challenges order dated 25.5.2007, Annexure P.1 cancelling order of posting of the petitioners to the Municipal Town Planning Wing as Building Inspectors. Case of the petitioners is that in the Building Department of Municipal Corporation, Amritsar, there are only seven Building Inspectors against twenty vacancies and, therefore, the petitioners were posted against the said vacant posts on 11.4.2007. Respondent Nos. 4 to 9 challenged the posting of the petitioners by filing a writ petition in this Court, which was disposed of vide order dated 23.4.2007 by directing that decision be taken on legal notice of the said respondents. Accordingly, order Annexure P.1 has been passed cancelling order of posting of the petitioners in the Town Planning Wing. A perusal of order Anenxure P.1 shows that the Principal Secretary to the Government of Punjab has taken into account service rules laying down the qualification for Inspectors which the petitioners did not possess. In the report Annexure P.7 submitted by the Commissioner, Municipal Corporation, to the Government, it has been stated that the services of the petitioners became surplus after abolition of octroi in which department, the petitioners were working and there was scarcity of staff in the Town Planning department. In the writ petition, finding recorded in the impugned order Anenxure P.1 that the petitioners were not technically qualified under the rules, has not been disputed. Contention raised is that the petitioners were not getting any extra monetary benefit by working in the said department and no loss was caused to the private respondents and that the private respondents did not fulfil the qualifications. The petitioners cannot claim any vested right to be posted on any particular post, particularly in absence of qualification, even if there may be shortage of staff in a particular department. The impugned order cancelling posting of the petitioners in the department of Town Planning cannot be held to be illegal or in violation of any law. No interference is, thus, called for with the impugned order. The writ petition is dismissed. (Adarsh Kumar Goel) Judge July 3, 2007 (Ajai Lamba) 'gs' Judge",

CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K.KANNAN . Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment? . To be referred to the Reporters or not? . Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? ***** K.KANNAN, J. (ORAL) . The petitioner seeks for allotment of a plot in his capacity as a locally displaced person, he having suffered loss of property by acquisition -2- under Punjab Town Improvement Act of 1922. The claim of the petitioner is that as a displaced person, he was entitled to be offered an alternative plot of a similar size. The property which he had lost in acquisition was 300 sq. yds and he had applied for an allotment to the Chairman of the Improvement Trust in the year 1987 and he had also made a payment of Rs.500/- as earnest money on 25.8.1987. The grievance of the petitioner is that although his brother and sister, who had similarly lost property, had been favoured with allotment of plots, the same had been denied to him. . The writ petition, therefore, came to be filed seeking for a issuance of writ of mandamus for allotment of a plot which had been originally allotted to him by the Chairman, Improvement Trust, Ludhiana with the boundaries mentioned in the proceedings. . The objection on behalf of the Improvement Trust was that the notification for acquisition had been made on 8.7.1973 under Section 36 of the Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922 and the acquisition was made on .5.1975 as per Section 42 and award has been passed on 1.8.1975. It is a submission on behalf of the respondent that the petitioner had not made any application for allotment all the years till the year 1987 but the Chairman of the Improvement Trust had no authority to make allotment without confirmation by the Trust. The further objection was that the Chairman had no power to allot a commercial plot and the Rules that were applicable, when he moved an application in the year 1987, was only the Punjab Town Improvement (Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots ) Rules 1983. The Rules, apart from setting out the definition of locally displaced person set out how the allotment in respect of the displaced persons having a joint katha, being co-sharers, could be allotted only for one plot taking into account the whole of joint land acquired and further that the allotment could be made under Rule 11, only to persons who had applied for allotment within a period of three months from the date of the commencement of the -3- Rules. Such allotment would again be available only to persons, who owned more than half an acre of property, which was lost in the acquisition. . The first point for consideration would be the relevant rule that would be applicable. It could be noticed that there were at different times, three types of Rules, one Ludhiana Improvement Trust Land Disposal Rules, 1964; subsequently, Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots by Improvement Trust Rules, 1975 till it was replaced by Punjab Town Improvement (Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots ) Rules, 1983. The applicability of the relevant rule has been dealt with in several decisions of this Hon'ble Court and particularly the matter was considered in Smt.Sushma Palta and others Vs. State of Punjab and others reported in 2006 (4) RCR (Civil) 223, where a Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court was considering the applicability of the Rule, in relation to the definition of a locally displaced person. Adverting to a situation that the acquisition had taken place prior to 1975, the Division Bench held that the definition that would govern, cannot be the 1975 Rules but only the Rules of the year 1951 would be applicable. This issue came up again in yet another case which was disposed in second appeal in Kulwinder Singh Vs. Improvement Trust, Ludhiana, in SA No.2699 of 1997, where the Court held that an advertisement which has been issued in the year 1974 before the actual acqusition would not be sufficient compliance of the Rules of the year 1964, since the publication was to be effected in a particular manner after the acquisition is made and therefore, any advertisement issued even prior to the date of acquisition cannot fetter the right of the individual to apply for an allotment without reference to the date stipulated in the 1974 advertisement. Judgment of this Court was also confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Improvement Trust, Ludhiana Vs. Kulwinder Singh in Civil Appeal No.1487 of 2003. Gurdev Kaur Vs. State of Punjab and another in CWP No.17248 of 1999, again addressed the issue of allotment of a plot under -4- Ludhiana Improvement Trust Land Disposal Rules 1964, when the Court by application of the 1964 Rules directed the competent authority to pass an order of allotment of a suitable residential plot in a scheme area. The decision in Gurmukh Singh Vs. State of Punjab and others in CWP No.4242 of 1985, which the learned counsel for the respondent was fair to cite is the last judgment in the string of decision that considers the relevant rules that would be applicable and the manner of fixation of price. Referring to an acquisition of property and allotment of land to a locally displaced person prior to 1975, the learned single Judge held that the 1964 Rules would govern the right of the parties and the property could be allotted to him, if he is found eligible for such allotment at a rate at which the trust had lastly sold any residential plot in the development scheme. The entitlement under the 1964 Rules are set out through Section 2(b). . In this case, the allotment by the Chairman of the Board is attacked on the ground that the property was not even specifically described with reference to the khalta number or specific extent. It merely had set out the property by boundaries and the Chairman himself had issued several allotment letters by the same boundaries to other persons also and therefore, the offer which had been made was vague and hence not capable of enforcement . . The entitlement for allotment of a plot, in my view, cannot be denied and the petitioner shall be allotted a plot. Even the contention that the plot that was offered by the Chairman of the Board was vague, is contested by the counsel for the petitioner by saying that the property is specifically described with boundaries and there is no difficulty about identifying the same. Learned counsel for the respondent, however, contends that within the boundaries mentioned, there is larger extent of property more than 2000 sq. yds, which the petitioner is not entitled to. He contends that the Improvement Trust has passed a Resolution on 6.2.2001 -5- proposing to raise a monument in the memory of martyrs of Kargil at the property, which the petitioner claims having been allotted to him. The construction of the memorial was stayed by an order of this Court in this writ petition, when the place was sought to be demarcated by erection of steel grill fencing. . The exact location of the property and the extent of property, originally allotted to the petitioner as wholly falling within the boundaries, is a subject of dispute between the parties, which this court in its exercise of jurisdictional power under Article 226 of Constitution cannot unravel without any further evidence. If the property, which is available there within the boundaries is only limited to the extent of 300 sq. yds, even a subsequent Resolution setting it apart for constructing a monument, shall not be put out against the petitioner. It shall be duty of the respondent to look for some other property for such use. If, on the other hand, the extent of property is larger, and the petitioner shall not be entitled to allotment of such a large plot, then the respondent would be entitled to put it to use for which a Resolution has been passed and they shall be at liberty to allot to the petitioner any other alternative plot, which is available under the Scheme. . The writ petition is allowed in the above terms. The compliance of order shall be made within a period of three months. CR No.2515 of 1989 (O&M) There is no representation for the petitioner. The order of impleadment already made by the court below, is confirmed in the light of entitlement as formed in the order in the writ petition. The Civil Revision is therefore dismissed.

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Ms. Munisha Gandhi, Advocate for the petitioner. Mr. Jayender Singh Chandail, Addl. AG Haryana for respondent No1. Mr. H.S. Gill, Senior Advocate with Mr. Ramesh Dhiman, Advocate for respondents No.2 to 4. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. (ORAL) Present writ petition was filed by Zile Singh on 2nd November, . During the pendency of proceedings, he died on 16th March, 1996 and is now being represented by his legal representatives. Present petition has been filed seeking a writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing of Annexure P-10 and P-12 passed by respondent No.2 and 3. Vide Annexure P-10, an order was passed by the Managing Director, Haryana State Cooperative Supply & Marketing Federation Limited, that petitioner has embezzled 55 bags of wheat amounting to Rs.7425/- out of wheat stocks lying at Hodal Mandi and he failed to lift 29 bags of wheat of Hassanpur Centre lying with M/s Jai Kishan Trading Co., Hassanpur and had thus caused loss of Rs.3915/-. The Managing Director held that he has no reason as to why punishment proposed in the show cause notice should not be made final. In the show cause notice given to the petitioner, dismissal from the service was proposed. Vide Annexure P-12, an appeal preferred by the petitioner was dismissed by the Administrative Committee of the respondent Haryana State Cooperative Supply & Marketing Federation Limited (hereinafter referred to as, HAFED ). Briefly stated, case of the petitioner is that he joined HAFED as a Clerk on 1st November, 1960. He was promoted as Assistant in the year 1969. Due to good service record, he was promoted to the post of Manager Grade-B in the year 1976. It has been averred that during the entire service record, no adverse remark was reported against the petitioner. In May 1980, petitioner was transferred to Hassanpur Procurement Centre as Manager, In-charge of Wheat Procurement Centre, Hassanpur. In July, 1980 he was transferred from Hassanpur Procurement Centre to Hodel Procurement Centre. On 20th November, 1980, a chargesheet was served upon the petitioner, in which two charges were set out. The chargesheet has been attached as Annexure P-1, and the same reads as under: 1. That he has sold 55 bags of wheat valuing Rs.7425/- out of Hafed wheat stock of 131 bags lying in the Hodal Mandi. This stock was required to be lifted by him and stored in the Hafed godown. Instead of doing this lawful duty he sold bags out of this stock and embezzled its sale proceeds for his personal ends. Similarly, Shri Zile Singh has failed to arrange the lying of 29 bags of wheat of Hafed from Hassanpur Centre lying with M/s Jai Kishan Trading Co. Hassanpur. This stock is now not available with the said firm which emplies a direct loss to Hafed to the extent of Rs.3915/-. As such he is responsible for causing this loss to Hafed alongwith Shri S.S. Nagpal, Accountant-cum-Store Keeper. Reply was filed by the petitioner, in which he stated that when he joined at Hodel, 55 bags were pending with M/s Rawat Shop Hodal and this fact can be verified from the record. It was further stated Rail Head Agency (RHA) of the firm retained Rs.400/- and therefore, there was a conflict between the RHA and the firm. Subsequently, District Manager had resolved the dispute. It was decided that 44 bags would be given by the Mandi Firm and balance would be recovered from the Storekeeper S.S. Nagpal. Therefore, it was stated that petitioner had nothing to do with the embezzlement. Regarding second charge, it was stated that no bags of HAFED are lying at Hassanpur Mandi. The Inquiry Officer found the submissions made by the petitioner before the Inquiry Officer, to be unsatisfactory and held him guilty on both counts. Therefore, the show cause notice (Annexure P-4) was served, as to why he be not dismissed from service. Reply to the show cause notice was filed. The same has been annexed as Annexure P-5. Reply was also rejected and vide Annexure P-10, services of the petitioner were dismissed. Aggrieved against the same, petitioner had filed an appeal (Annexure P-11) and as stated earlier, vide Annexure P-12, appeal was dismissed. Dismissal order, in the present case, was passed on 26th April, and the appeal was dismissed on 6th March, 1987. Simultaneously, the employer respondent HAFED had initiated recovery proceedings against the petitioner for an amount of Rs.22,220/-, for embezzlement of bags of wheat, which was lying at Hodal Mandi and 29 bags of wheat of Hassanpur Centre, which were lying with M/s Jai Kishan Trading Co., Hassanpur. In the recovery proceedings so initiated by the employer, Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Palwal, District Faridabad, vide a well reasoned order (Annexure P-14), held as under: Hafed has only produced copy of P.V. report dated .6.80. Stock register and no other concrete evidence was produced. The evidence produced by Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A. Hodel which were Ann. 1 to 5 which were attached in this file at to 40 which are concrete evidence. And Zile Singh has given in writing that payment of the Transporter be made only after deducting the price of 40 bags. Shri Zile Singh has given the evidence of 30 bags which were left with the Transporter. But according to stock position, statement 20.5.81, against him 38-10 bags were remained. This statement was prepared by the District Manager, Hafed. Therefore, P.V. has no value. About 10 bags Shri Zile Singh has written in his letter that in one truck which was loaded in excess of which payment was taken after unloading the same by the Truck driver of the Transporter with some shopkeeper at Delhi and Shri Zile Singh has written in his statement that Transporter has deposited the price of 8 bags in Hafed R.H.A. Hodel. This statement was also heard and read by Shri Deepak Kumar, District Accountant, But he had not raised any objection to it. Even then if payment of 8 bags were not taken from the transporter then Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A. Hodel may be held liable. The price of the rest of the 30 bags must be deducted from the payment of the transporter at the time of payment. Payment of this was made by the then D.M. Hafed, Faridabad and at the time of payment to the Transporter, that amount was not deducted. Therefore, for this amount the D.M. Hafed Faridabad of that time is responsible. Therefore, case be prepared against him. Today dated 4.2.86, the order is announced in the open Court in the presence of Shri Nav Rattan Singh, District Manager, Hafed, Faridabad, Shri Deepak Kumar, District Accountant, Hafed, Faridabad and Shri Rajbir Singh, D.O. (M.S.) Hafed Faridabad (Petitioner) and Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A. Hodel (Defendant). Ms. Munisha Gandhi appearing for the petitioner has raised two fold submissions before this Court. Firstly, it has been stated that in the recovery proceedings, the plea raised by the petitioner has been accepted. Same plea was raised by the petitioner before the Inquiry Officer and therefore, in parallel proceedings, two contrary findings have been arrived at. It has been further submitted that order passed by the Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, who is an independent quasi-judicial authority, has absolved the petitioner of the charges and the order passed by Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Palwal should be taken into consideration by the Department, as the petitioner has proved his innocence. It has been further stated that appeal of the petitioner has been dismissed vide Annexure P-12 and the order of the appellate authority does not reflect any application of mind. It only states that after discussion, the Committee felt that there was no force in the appeal of Zile Singh, and rejected his appeal. It has been further stated that the coram of order (Annexure P-12) will show that the Managing Director, HAFED was present. It has been stated that the impugned order was passed by the Managing Director, HAFED, therefore, he could not participate in the Administrative Committee, as he could not be a Judge of his own cause. Therefore, order (Annexure P-12) is vitiated. Mr. H.S. Gill, Senior Advocate assisted by Mr. Ramesh Dhiman, states that the Managing Director, HAFED, present was not the same person. I am of the view that this contention cannot be accepted. Therefore, the order of the appellate authority is set aside. The order was passed by the Managing Director in his official capacity and the Managing Director is bound to defend the order before the Administrative Committee, therefore, the order (Annexure P-12) is liable to be set aside. Taking into consideration the fact that during pendency of the appeal, order Annexure P-14 has been passed in favour of the petitioner, legal representatives of the petitioner are permitted to file fresh grounds of appeal and may also place on record Annexure P-16 and P-17 before the Appellate Authority, which, on consideration of the same, will pass a speaking order. The appeal shall be decided within six months after the receipt of certified copy of this order. With these observations, present writ petition is disposed off.

    "case_id": "appeal filed under Section 110-D of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, challenges the award dated 8.10.1987 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana ( for brevity `MACT'). The Tribunal has recorded findings that the claimant/appellants have not been able to prove the accident or the fact that the deceased Gurmukh Singh received injuries on account of rash and negligent driving of the bus by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. The Tribunal has further held that the claimant/appellants were the legal representatives of deceased Gurmukh Singh and that the income of deceased Gurmukh Singh was Rs.650/- per FAO No.161 of 1988 2 month and the dependency has been worked out at Rs.200/- per month. A multiplier of 15 has been applied. The father of the deceased claimant/appellant No.1 has been found to be 50 years of age and mother of the deceased claimant/appellant No.2 has been found to be 45 years of age. The other claimants were the brother and sister. However, only Daljit Kaur, minor, who was 16 years of age, has filed the appeal being claimant/appellant No.3. The deceased was 23 years of age at the time of his death and was post graduate. Accordingly a multiplier of 15 was applied and a total claim of Rs.36,000/- as compensation was calculated. However, on account of the fact that the claimant/appellants had failed to prove the accident, their claim application was dismissed. It would be appropriate to make a reference to the analysis of evidence undertaken by the tribunal to reach the conclusion that the accident did not take place on 11.2.1987 at :30 p.m. The same reads as under:- In support of this issue, the claimants have examined Mohinder Singh, PW1. He has stated that on 11.2.1987 at about 5:30 PM he was coming on a Luna Moped on Moga- Ludhiana road and when he was at some distance from Aarti Cinema Chowk towards Moga side the bus came from the side of Moga which was being driven at a very fast speed and at that time the deceased was also going on a Luna Moped from the side of Moga and he was crushed by the bus driver under the bus when he was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk to go to Gurdev Nagar. In his cross- examination, he has stated that he did not see the deceased Gurmukh Singh going in front of him and he saw him for the FAO No.161 of 1988 3 first time after the accident and that he reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes of the accident. He has further admitted that it is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on that side of the round about which faces Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana. The learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the accident stands proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as referred above. In reply to this argument, the learned counsel for the respondents have argued that no accident is proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as he has clearly admitted in his cross-examination that he reached the place of accident after about 10 or 15 minutes after the accident and the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped coming from the side of Jagraon. This argument seems to be correct. In case Mohinder Singh PW1 reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident, then it means that he did not witness the accident. No other witness has been examined by the claimants to prove the accident. The case of the claimants is that one Jagdish Lal also witnessed the accident, but he has not been examined by them for the reasons best known to them. The respondents have examined Kamikkar Singh driver, respondent No.4 in rebuttal as PW1. He has denied the allegations that the accident took place with his bus. Under these circumstances, there is no evidence on the file to prove that the accident took place with the bus which was FAO No.161 of 1988 4 being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver respondent No.4 and Gurmukh Singh received injuries in that accident. Thus, this issue remains un-proved and is decided against the claimants. During the pendency of the appeal, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants filed an application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC with the prayer to place on record a copy of the FIR No.30 dated 11.2.1987, registered at Police Station Civil Line Ludhiana, an hour after the accident. The accident had taken place at 5:30 p.m. and the FIR was lodged at 6:45 p.m. Vide a separate order passed today, the afore-mentioned application has been allowed as it was not brought on record before the Tribunal. Mr. Satinder Khanna, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants has argued that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in discarding the statement made by Mohinder Singh PW1 on the ground that he was not an eye witness as he reached the place of accident after 10-15 minutes is absolutely illegal. The version disclosed in the FIR would highlight that the deceased Gurmukh Singh was going in front of Mohinder Singh, the author of the FIR, on his Luna Moped bearing registration No.PJL 5057. Mohinder Singh was also following him on his own Luna No. PAL 9024. According to learned counsel, the statement made in the court was recorded after about 8 months and the detailed authentic version has been disclosed in the FIR lodged after about one hour. Learned counsel has emphasised that had the respondents desired, they could have confronted PW1 Mohinder Singh with this FIR where the version is different than the one disclosed in the statement made before the court. He has argued that once the driver of a vehicle is tried on account of rash and negligent driving it has to be prima-facie concluded that the accident was FAO No.161 of 1988 5 caused on account of rash and negligent driving, therefore, learned counsel has argued that the findings recorded by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 are liable to be reversed and it must be held that the accident has been caused on account of rash and negligent driving by Kamikkar Singh, driver- respondent No.4. Mr.S.K.Bhanot, learned State counsel has however, submitted that the tribunal has taken into account the statement made by the witness Mohinder Singh (PW1) admitting that he had reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes and that the place of accident was not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon. So he has submitted that the FIR cannot be taken into consideration unless it is proved either by its author or any other person. Therefore, it has been suggested that the FIR cannot be taken into account at this stage and the findings deserve to be upheld. Having heard learned counsel and perusing the record of the Tribunal, I am of the considered view that the findings recorded by the Tribunal cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. The Tribunal has stretched the statement of PW1 Mohinder Singh that he reached the place of accident -15 minutes later. The statement of Mohinder Singh PW1 infact no where suggests that he was not an eye witness to the accident. The relevant portions of the statement in chief and the cross-examination are as under:- On 11.2.87 at about 5:30 PM I was coming on the Moga Ludhiana road on a Luna Moped. When I was at some distance from Aarti Cinema towards Moga side, bus No.PJG 3108 came from the side of Moga. It was being driven at a very fast speed. Gurmukh Singh was also coming on a Luna Moped from the FAO No.161 of 1988 6 side of Moga. He was ahead of the bus. When Gurmukh Singh was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk the bus crushed him to death. The bus was being driven by Kamikkar Singh driver. The bus driver did not blow the horn. The bus was out of his control on account of the high speed. Gurmukh Singh was aged about 23 years. He died at the spot. One Jagdish Lal witnessed the accident. At about 8 PM the dead body of Gurmukh Singh was taken by us to Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, where it was subjected to post mortem examination.---------- The accident took place in that chowk when Gurmukh Singh was negotiating a turn on his right side to go to Gurdev Nagar. It is incorrect to suggest that there is a bus stop on the Ludhiana Moga road in between Aarti Cinema chowk and the Aarti cinema and all the buses coming from the side of Moga stop on that bus stop. It is correct that there is a rickshaw stand in between Arti Cinema and the chowk on the left side of the road while coming from Moga. Aarti Cinema chowk is a thickly populated area and there is great rush of vehicles on that part of the road. It is incorrect to suggest that Gurmukh Singh was struck down by a truck who ran away and the bus was wrongly involved while bus was stationary on the bus stop. It is also incorrect to suggest that I was not present at the place and time of accident.---------- I had not stated in my police statement that I and the deceased were going to that side in connection with the business of our FAO No.161 of 1988 7 shop. I did not see the deceased going in front of me. I saw him after the accident. I reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident. It is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on the side of the round about. The place of accident is that part of the round about of the chowk which faces Gurdev Nagar road. I saw him dead for the first time. Many persons had gathered there at the place of accident.---------- A perusal of the statement made by PW1 Mohinder Singh would show that the deceased was going on his Luna Moped ahead of the bus and not in front of the bus. He further stated that the deceased was taking turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk and at that time the bus crushed him to death which was being driven by driver-respondent No.4. He reiterated the statement when cross-examined by the learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 and denied the suggestion that Gurmukh Singh infact had struck against the truck which ran away, while the bus was stationary on the bus stop or that he was not present at the place and time of accident. During the cross-examination by driver-respondent No.4 the witness has stated that he did not see the deceased going in front of him, but there was no contradiction between the examination-in-chief and cross- examination. As such as in the examination-in-chief the witness had stated that the deceased was going ahead of the bus. The witness further stated that he saw the deceased after the accident and had reached the place of accident or 15 minutes after the accident. The afore mentioned statement made during cross-examination does not necessarily mean that the witness was FAO No.161 of 1988 8 giving an eye witness account. In fact, the witness was explaining the circumstantial evidence which lead to an inference that the deceased was killed in the accident on account of rash and negligent driving of bus by driver Kamikkar Singh, respondent No.4. The afore mentioned version finds support from the contents of the FIR recorded after about one hour. It shows that driver-respondent No.4, after hitting Gurmukh Singh, the deceased, stopped the bus at a distance and on coming to know about the death of Gurmukh Singh-deceased, he had run away. In these circumstances the statement made in the FIR if has been used for the purpose of contradiction can also be used for the purpose of corroboration. Such is the position of law under Section 162 of Criminal Procedure Code 1973. According to the proviso to Section 162(1) of Cr.P.C, if the statement made in the FIR is proved then the same may be used by the accused and with the permission of the Court by the prosecution to contradict a witness in the manner provided by Section 145 of Evidence Act, 1872 and that any part of the statement made in the FIR could also be used for corroboration. The principle incorporated by Section 162 Cr.P.C. would be applicable and the section itself ipso-facto may not apply. If that be so than the FIR and the statement made before the court read together would lead to only one conclusion that there were adequate circumstances supporting the inference that accident was caused by the offending bus which was being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Tribunal are liable to be set aside. Even otherwise this court has held in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham reported as 1993(2) PLR 109 that once a driver has been tried of an offence of rash and negligent driving, it is prima-facie safe to conclude that FAO No.161 of 1988 9 the accident had occurred on that account. I have also gone through the file of the Trial Court in Criminal Case No.137/2/87",

    "court": "IN THE HIGH COURT FOR THE STATES OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT CHANDIGARH DATE OF ORDER: 1.12.2006 Hardeep ...Petitioner(s) Versus Sunita ....Respondent(s) CORUM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.M. AGGARWAL .*.*.*. Present: Dr. Surya Parkash, Advocate. Mr. Arun Jain, Advocate. M.M. AGGARWAL,J This is an appeal against judgment dated 24.4.1998 passed by Additional District Judge, Hisar whereby petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act for dissolution of marriage filed by the present appellant i.e husband Hardeep against his wife Sunita respondent was dismissed. The marriage in this case had taken place on 10.5.1989 at Bahadurgarh. The parties had lived as husband and wife at Hansi but no child was born out of the wedlock. At the time of marriage, appellant is stated to be a Probationary Officer in Bank but he was preparing and #2# appearing for Central Services Examination. According to the appellant, respondent wife did not cooperate with him and started torturing him. She was suffering from inferiority complex and never wanted appellant to get high position in life. Then on .2.1990, when she was at matrimonial home at Hansi, she started quarrelling with him and other family members without any rhyme and reason and created a scene by coming out of the house into street and then when he along with his family members as also one Ram Kumar was present in the house, she deliberately poured kerosene oil upon herself and put her ablaze with the calculated mind of establishing that she could use coercive methods. Then he (husband appellant) had doused her flames. That respondent-wife was in fact guilty of attempting to commit suicide but she falsely got registered the case for the offence under Section 498-A IPC in which appellant, his aged parents of the appellant and sister-in-law were arrested and remained in jail for several days. Further petitioner-husband was selected in the Central Services to be posted as ACP but respondent-wife created problems. Later on, appellant was selected for HCS post and again respondent created problems against his appointment and the appellant could get the appointment only after filing writ in this Court. Earlier a petition for divorce had been filed by the husband in the year 1990, which was dismissed on merits on .10.1992 copy Annexure R-11 and appeal had been filed in this Court against that judgment but that was dismissed as husband did not pay the maintenance. In the earlier petition, ground of cruelty had been taken but since there was FIR of the occurrence dated 3.2.1990 and that matter was #3# pending trial, grounds of cruelty of incident of 3.2.1990 were not taken into consideration and discussed. In the present petition, there was an issue whether the petition was barred by principle of resjudicata. Additional District Judge had held that all the instances of cruelty except incident of .2.1990 were barred by principle of resjudicata and only incident of .2.1990 was considered and it had been held that the appellant was not entitled to decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty. Counsel for the appellant-husband had argued that the marriage took place in the year 1989. Parties had lived together only for short time and they are living separately since 1990 and it is a broken marriage. It was argued that false FIR was got registered of the incident of 3.2.1990. Appellant-husband, his father, mother and his sister were arrested and the appellant-husband could not get service as ACP and then as HCS Officer and he could get the service only after a writ petition was filed in this Court and order dated 22.7.1993 (copy Annexure P-2) was made. It was argued that in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 , it is a fit case, where marriage should be dissolved by decree of divorce. On behalf of the respondent-wife, it was argued that from the very beginning, petitioner-husband had made up his mind not to keep the wife. He had even written letter copy Annexure R-13 just after three months of the marriage. It was argued that the appellant cannot be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong. However, perusal of language of R-13 shows that petitioner wanted his wife to rise in life. From the record, it would come out that earlier petition for divorce had been filed in the year 1990 by the husband, #4# which was dismissed. There were proceedings under Section 125 Cr.P.C, which was got dismissed as withdrawn by the wife (copy Annexure P-4) on .11.1993. The present petition for divorce had been filed on 31.7.1995 and was decided on 24.4.1998, more than eight years back. Before hearing the arguments in this appeal, parties had been called to come present. They had appeared but then again it was found that no settlement between the parties in the form of mutual divorce or living together was possible. Husband is stated to be an HCS Officer whereas the wife is also stated to be employed in some private concern and may be earning some money. For the incident of 3.2.1990, an FIR No.308 dated 9.12.1990 under Section 498-A IPC had been registered at P.S City Bahadurgarh at the instance of father of the respondent-wife. Annexure P-3 shows that all the witnesses including respondent-wife had turned hostile in that case and did not support their allegations and then accused, who happened to be present appellant i.e husband Hardeep, his father, mother and sister had been acquitted on 16.8.1994. Even in spite of that, things did not improve and present petition for divorce had been filed in July 1995. Now more than 17 years have passed when the marriage took place. There had been litigation in the form of earlier petition under Section of the Hindu Marriage Act, 125 Cr.P.C, a criminal case for offence under Section 498-A IPC and second petition for divorce filed in 1995. Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 62 of the judgment reported in Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 had observed as under: Even at this stage, the respondent does not want divorce by mutual consent. From the analysis and evaluation of #5# the entire evidence, it is clear that the respondent has resolved to live in agony only to make life a miserable hell for the appellant as well. This type of adamant and callous attitude, in the context of the facts of this case, leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that the respondent is bent upon treating the appellant with mental cruelty. It is abundantly clear that the marriage between the parties had broken down irretrievably and there is no chance of their coming together, or living together again. When the case for the offence under Section 498-A IPC was registered and the husband, his sister and parents-in-law were arrested and thereafter during trial the witnesses turn hostile and husband and other relatives are acquitted, then it is itself a cruelty practised. This is further born out from the fact that father of the respondent-wife had written complaints copy Annexure P-1 so that husband does not get posting as ACP and then posting of the husband to the HCS was delayed at the instance of respondent or her father and husband could get appointment only through the intervention of the Court. In the case before Hon'ble Supreme Court, parties had been living separately for more than 10 years whereas in this case, they had been living separately for more than 16 years and there had been criminal and civil proceedings between the parties. The marriage has subsisted only in name. It has wrecked beyond the hope of salvage. Respondent still does not want divorce by mutual consent. Preservation of marriage is totally unworkable and is source of misery for the parties. Marriage has definitely #6# been irretrievably broken down.",

Through the present appeal the State has approached this court for reduction in compensation for the acquisition of land. Briefly, the facts of the case are that the State of Haryana vide notification dated 12.5.1995 issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, (for short, the Act ), acquired land forming part of Hadbast No. 38, in revenue estate of Bahadurgarh, District Jhajjar, for development and utilisation as residential and commercial area in Sector-9 and 9-A, Bahadurgarh. The Land Acquisition Collector assessed the market value of the land at Rs. 6 lacs per acre for the land situated on Bahadurgarh-Delhi road upto the depth of 3 acres, Rs. 4 lacs per acre for the land situated on Bahadurgarh-Najafgarh road upto the depth of 3 acres, Rs. 2.50 lacs per acre for nehri and chahi and Rs. 2 lacs per acre for barani and other kinds of land. The landowners/claimants feeling dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded by the Collector, filed objections. On reference under Section 18 of the Act, the learned court below determined the market value of the acquired land by granting increase of Rs. 50,000/- per acre in each category. It is this award of the learned Reference Court which is impugned in the present appeal. Learned counsel for the State very fairly conceded that the issue involved in the present appeal is squarely covered by the judgment of this court in R. F. A. No. 1 of 2006 State of Haryana and another vs Jagbir Singh and others, decided on 10.2.2009, whereby the compensation payable to the landowners has been further enhanced. Since this court has further enhanced the compensation payable to the landowners, the present appeal for reduction in compensation does not survive. Accordingly, for the reasons recorded in Jagbir Singh's case, the present appeal is dismissed. .2.2009 ( Rajesh Bindal) vs.",

Respondents Coram: Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajesh Bindal Present: Mr. Lokesh Sinhal, Additional Advocate General, Haryana. Mr. Raman Gaur, Advocate, for HUDA. Rajesh Bindal J. Through the present appeal the State has approached this court for reduction in compensation for the acquisition of land. Briefly, the facts of the case are that the State of Haryana vide notification dated 12.5.1995 issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, (for short, the Act ), acquired land forming part of Hadbast No. 38, in revenue estate of Bahadurgarh, District Jhajjar, for development and utilisation as residential and commercial area in Sector-9 and 9-A, Bahadurgarh. The Land Acquisition Collector assessed the market value of the land at Rs. 6 lacs per acre for the land situated on Bahadurgarh-Delhi road upto the depth of 3 acres, Rs. 4 lacs per acre for the land situated on Bahadurgarh-Najafgarh road upto the depth of 3 acres, Rs. 2.50 lacs per acre for nehri and chahi and Rs. 2 lacs per acre for barani and other kinds of land. The landowners/claimants feeling dissatisfied with the quantum of compensation awarded by the Collector, filed objections. On reference under Section 18 of the Act, the learned court below determined the market value of the acquired land by granting increase of Rs. 50,000/- per acre in each category. It is this award of the learned Reference Court which is impugned in the present appeal. Learned counsel for the State very fairly conceded that the issue involved in the present appeal is squarely covered by the judgment of this court in R. F. A. No. 1 of 2006 State of Haryana and another vs Jagbir Singh and others, decided on 10.2.2009, whereby the compensation payable to the landowners has been further enhanced. Since this court has further enhanced the compensation payable to the landowners, the present appeal for reduction in compensation does not survive. Accordingly, for the reasons recorded in Jagbir Singh's case, the present appeal is dismissed. .2.2009 ( Rajesh Bindal) vs.",
