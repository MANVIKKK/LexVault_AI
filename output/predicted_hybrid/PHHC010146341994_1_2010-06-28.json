Alka Verma and others ..Respondents\n\nCORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE MUKUL MUDGAL, CHIEF JUSTICE HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AJAY TEWARI .Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment ? .Whether to be referred to the Reporters or not ? .Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? Present : None for the parties. ***** MUKUL MUDGAL, C.J.\n\n(Oral)\n\nNo one is present on behalf of the appellants. Since the matter involved in this appeal is similar to the one involved in Civil Writ Petition No. 2944 of 1994 which has been disposed of today by passing a detailed order, this appeal is also disposed of in the same terms. However, it is made clear that in case any issue which needs adjudication by the Court survives, the appellants may apply for revival of the appeal.\n\n(MUKUL MUDGAL) CHIEF JUSTICE (AJAY TEWARI) JUDGE .06.2010 'ravinder'",
