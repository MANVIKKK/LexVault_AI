Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgement? . To be referred to the Reporters or not? . Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? PRESENT: Mr. Subhash Ahuja, Advocate, for the petitioners. Mr. A.S. Jattana, Addl. AG, Punjab for the State. **** RANJIT SINGH, J.\n\nThe petitioners have filed this writ petition seeking a writ of mandamus commanding the respondents to grant them one pre-mature increment on the ground that they had not participated in the strike observed by Punjab Government employees on 8.2.1978. The petitioners have claimed this relief on the ground that other employees have been granted the same relief. The petitioners plead that they had not participated in the strike but were on leave. State counsel has relied upon a Full Bench CIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 13640 of 1991\n\ndecision in Saroj Kumari Versus State of Punjab, 1998 (3) RSJ to urge that in view of the observations made in this case, the petitioners would not be entitled to the relief claimed. I have perused the judgment. As per this judgment, benefit of pre-mature increment can not be allowed in such a situation when the person was on leave during strike. The relief claimed would not be available to the petitioners in view of law laid down in the case of Saroj Kumari (supra). The writ petition is, accordingly, dismissed.
