Testamentary Suit No. 72 of 1989 arose out of the Testamentary Petition No. 494 of 1989 upon a caveat being filed. The disputes between the Caveator and the Petitioner were resolved and Minutes were filed on 2nd December 1992. . Despite these minutes, it appears that the Petition remained pending since certain office objections had not been removed.

This resulted in that very Petition being once again renumbered, this time as Testamentary Suit No. 56 of 1995. Thus, the position was that in a single Testamentary Petition propounding one Will, there were two contested actions each separately numbered as a Suit. . The Caveator in the first Testamentary Suit No. 72 of 1989 then filed Suit No. 3255 of 1995 seeking to have the Minutes of the order dated 2nd December 1992 set aside. .

The Plaintiff in Suit No.3255 of 1995 is or was the Caveator/Defendant in the first Testamentary Suit No.72 of 1989.
