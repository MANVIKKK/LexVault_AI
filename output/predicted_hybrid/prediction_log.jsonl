{"case_id": "Criminal Revision was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation to impugn the judgment dated 27.2.1996 rendered by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur. Complaint under Section 85(g) of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 ( hereinafter referred to as the Act ) was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation through its Insurance Inspector/ Manager, Local Office, Dhariwal, on the allegations that accused Rakesh Kumar Ohri (Proprietor) was and continued to be the Principal Employer of M/S. Raman & Company (Rice Mill), Awankhe Gate, near D.A.V.School, Dina Nagar in terms of Section 2(17) of the Act and at the time of committing of offence was in-charge and was responsible to the establishment for the superannuating of control of the business of the establishment. The accused has failed to produce the record, namely, wages/salaries registers, contribution registers, return of contributions, registers of employees' under Regulation 32 and other record pertaining to the payment of contributions, Inspection book, payment vouchers and ledgers and cash books for inspection before Insurance Inspector on 10.8.1993 and 22.9.1993 for the period from 1.7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Due to non- production of the record as mentioned above, accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Accused was summoned to face trial. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued. Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Accused moved an application dated 11.2.1995 for dropping the proceedings on the allegation that complaint was instituted after the expiry of period of limitation, as per Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. Notice was issued to the complainant. Ultimately, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, opined that complaint is not maintainable being time barred and was dismissed. Feeling dissatisfied with the order dated 27.2.1996 this revision petition was instituted. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the revisionist argued that main complaint was presented on 10.11.1993. After summoning, accused had appeared on 23.11.1994. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued on 5.1.1995. Under the Act, no limitation is provided. Maximum sentence under Section 85(g) of the Act is two years and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-. Contribution is every month. Due to non-deposit of contribution offence under Sectilon 85(g) is a continuing offence. Learned counsel for the revisionist cited ESIC Vs. C.C.Santhakumar, JT 2006(10) SC 549. Learned counsel for the respondent argued that as per Section 468 Cr.P.C. complaint was not within limitation. Court has no power to take cognizance beyond the expiry of limitation. Due to non-production of record, complaint should have been filed within six months. As per the Act, question of limitation can be agitated at any stage even after cognizance is taken. In the present case, cognizance was taken on 5.1.1995 when notice was issued. As per allegation of the revisionist, respondent failed to produce record pertaining to the payment of contributions, inspection book, payment vouchers, ledgers and cash book etc for investigation for the period from .7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Complaint was presented in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur on .11.1993. Notice was issued to the accused to appear in the Court. After appearance of the accused, on 23.11.1994, notice under Section 85(g) was issued on 5.1.1995. Record is silent as to on which date application for dropping proceedings under Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. were presented. Due to non-production of record, accused are liable for the commission of offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Section 85(g) of the Act is reproduced as under:- (g) is guilty of any contravention of or non- compliance with any of the requirements of this Act or the rules or the regulations in respect of which no special penalty is provided. ( he shall be punishable (i) where the commits an offence under clause (a), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years but- (a) which shall not be less than one year, in case of failure to pay the employee s contribution which has been deducted by him from the employee s wages and shall also be liable to fine of ten thousand rupees; (b) which shall not be less than six months, in any other case and shall also be liable to fine of five thousand rupees. Provided that the Court may, or any adequate and special reason to be recorded in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a lesser term. (ii) where he commits an offence under any of the clauses (b) to (g) (both inclusive), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to four thousand rupees, or with both.) In E.S.I.C. v. C.C. Santhakumar, JT 2006 (10) SC , the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:- 21. It is clear, therefore, that the right of the Corporation to recover these amounts by coercive process is not restricted by any limitation nor could be the Government by recourse to the rule-making power prescribed a period in the teeth of Section 68. . In the above judgment this Court has clearly held that Section 68 of the Act empowers the Corporation to resort to coercive process, to recover the contribution from the employer as if it were an arrear of land revenue and the said right is not restricted by any limitation. This is a crucial Section. . Similarly, no limitation is provided in Chapter VII. It deals with the imposition of penalty or levy of damages upon failure to pay contributions. It consists of Sections 84 to 86A. . When the Act itself does not provide for any limitation on the Corporation right to claim, the employers cannot rely upon Regulations 32 to , dealing with the period for maintenance of registers, to imply any limitation. Gurdeep Singh Vs. State and others, (3) 289 was relied by the learned trial Court for disposing of the application for dropping proceedings wherein it was held that: A. Delhi Police Act, 1978, Sections 93 and and 2 ( r)- Altercation took place inside the house No offence under Section 93 made out- Offence under Section 93 is made out if accused used any street or public place for threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intend to provoke breach of peace.

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate for the appellant. Ms. Hemlata Balhara, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana for the State. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. Taqdir Singh son of Lehri Singh has preferred the present appeal and has challenged the judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 30th July, 1998, whereby he was held guilty of offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The trial Court had sentenced the appellant under Section 452 IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant was further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1 years under Section 376 IPC. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 of Police Station Sahlawas was present at Jhajjar, when the prosecutrix PW-1 (whose name has been withheld to protect her identity) along with her husband Nahnu Ram PW-5 appeared and made statement Ex.PA, on the basis of which FIR No.32 dated .05.1996 was registered at Police Station Sahlawas. The prosecutrix stated that her parents belong to Dadri Toe. About 11 months before the occurrence, she was married with Nahnu Ram. She was staying in her matrimonial home at village Chandol. She had set up a separate residence with her husband three months before the occurrence and her in-laws were residing in another house. On 3rd May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m. her husband had gone to village Bhakli to do the work of Halwai (sweet maker) in a marriage and she was alone at her house. At about .00 p.m., she went to sleep in the courtyard after bolting the door of her house. She had retired to her bed after taking her meals. At about 11.00 p.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time, the present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had gagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear only. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her mouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied both of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in both the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were broken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide resistance.

In the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in- law Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was sent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm to her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house, since the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of the people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant along with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police.

{"case_id": "writ petitions in the High Court claiming revised scales of pay on the ground that they had taken graduate degrees and, therefore, were entitled to the benefit of the grade mentioned against Category `A' in the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957. In opposition to the writ petitions, the State Government contended that the letter did not contemplate the grant of the grade to all teachers but only to teachers appointed as Masters. The High Court held the teachers entitled to the benefit of the revised grade, whether or not they had been appointed as Masters, because, in the opinion of the High Court, the qualifying criterion was the possession of a graduate degree. The judgment of the High Court was affirmed by this Court in Kirpal Singh Bhatia (AIR 1976 SC 2459) (supra). The State Government found it difficult, having regard to the prevailing burden on its financial resources, to extend the benefit of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 to the much wider section of teachers covered in consequence of the Court's judgment.

{"case_id": "Appeal has been filed by the wife against the judgment dated 3.6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhatinda whereby a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for short the Act) on the ground of cruelty and desertion, preferred by the respondent husband, has been accepted and their marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce. [2]. The marriage between the parties was solemnized on 19.2.1973 at Patiala. At the time when the subject divorce petition was filed by the husband on 21.10.1991, they had three male children born out of the wedlock and they were about 18, 16 and 12 years of age respectively. In his -: 2 :- petition, the respondent alleged that the behaviour of the appellant towards the respondent and his old mother was indifferent from the very beginning; that she is suffering from some sort of mental disorder with the result that she refused to cook meals for him and the minor children; that she levelled false allegations qua the character of the respondent; that she gave severe beatings to the mother of the respondent on 22.9.1990 and that as a result thereof, he filed a divorce petition in which the appellant allegedly made a statement on 13.3.1991 that she will not misbehave in future with the respondent or his mother and undertook not to file any complaints against him either to the police or to the higher authorities of the Board; that the matter was compromised and the petition for dissolution of the marriage was withdrawn. [3]. The respondent has further averred that soon after the above stated compromise, the appellant allegedly refused to honour her words and started making false and frivolous complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda alleging that she had fear for her life at the hands of the respondent. The respondent alleged that he along with the children has been forced to live in the small rented house and that he has a vast circle of friends but the appellant allegedly refused to look after the visitors and forced the respondent to cook meals, clean utensils and wash the clothes of the children also . This fact was allegedly noticed by the relatives and friends of the respondent who used to visit the house thereby causing great mental cruelty to him as the respondent's reputation stood blotted. It was further alleged that the appellant in connivance with her father broke open the locks of the house which is under the possession of his mother and valuable articles were removed.... . It was also alleged that -: 3 :- the appellant threatened the respondent to get him physically liquidated . On the strength of these allegations, the respondent sought dissolution of their marriage by a decree of divorce. [4]. The appellant contested the above stated petition vide her reply dated 16.12.1992 and took a preliminary objection that the respondent in fact was taking advantage of his own wrongs as it was he who subjected her to cruelty even though she wanted to lead a honorable life with him. The appellant specifically averred that the respondent has deserted her with ulterior motive and has declined to give food and shelter . On merits, the appellant took the plea that soon after their marriage, the respondent started harassing her for bringing insufficient dowry and did not even attend the marriage of her brother held in the year 1974. She alleged that till the time her father-in-law was alive, the respondent used to behave reasonably well, however, after his death in the year 1978, he started beating her mercilessly and on many occasions refused to provide food or woolen clothes during winters. It was alleged that for the last over five years, the respondent has been continuously beating her so badly and ruthlessly that it has also affected her eye sight. She denied the allegations that she refused to cook food for the respondent, their children or her mother-in-law or that she ever made any false complaints against the respondent to the authorities. In para of the written statement, the appellant specifically alleged that in fact the respondent desired to re-marry and wanted to get rid of her . She further alleged that the previous divorce petition was withdrawn by the respondent after stating that he had compromised the matter and shall not beat her and will behave properly in future. In fact the divorce petition was withdrawn by him to avoid maintenance pendente-lite and litigation expenses.

{"case_id": "appeal filed under Section 110-D of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, challenges the award dated 8.10.1987 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana ( for brevity `MACT'). The Tribunal has recorded findings that the claimant/appellants have not been able to prove the accident or the fact that the deceased Gurmukh Singh received injuries on account of rash and negligent driving of the bus by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. The Tribunal has further held that the claimant/appellants were the legal representatives of deceased Gurmukh Singh and that the income of deceased Gurmukh Singh was Rs.650/- per FAO No.161 of 1988 2 month and the dependency has been worked out at Rs.200/- per month. A multiplier of 15 has been applied. The father of the deceased claimant/appellant No.1 has been found to be 50 years of age and mother of the deceased claimant/appellant No.2 has been found to be 45 years of age. The other claimants were the brother and sister. However, only Daljit Kaur, minor, who was 16 years of age, has filed the appeal being claimant/appellant No.3. The deceased was 23 years of age at the time of his death and was post graduate. Accordingly a multiplier of 15 was applied and a total claim of Rs.36,000/- as compensation was calculated. However, on account of the fact that the claimant/appellants had failed to prove the accident, their claim application was dismissed. It would be appropriate to make a reference to the analysis of evidence undertaken by the tribunal to reach the conclusion that the accident did not take place on 11.2.1987 at :30 p.m. The same reads as under:- In support of this issue, the claimants have examined Mohinder Singh, PW1. He has stated that on 11.2.1987 at about 5:30 PM he was coming on a Luna Moped on Moga- Ludhiana road and when he was at some distance from Aarti Cinema Chowk towards Moga side the bus came from the side of Moga which was being driven at a very fast speed and at that time the deceased was also going on a Luna Moped from the side of Moga and he was crushed by the bus driver under the bus when he was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk to go to Gurdev Nagar. In his cross- examination, he has stated that he did not see the deceased Gurmukh Singh going in front of him and he saw him for the FAO No.161 of 1988 3 first time after the accident and that he reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes of the accident. He has further admitted that it is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on that side of the round about which faces Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana. The learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the accident stands proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as referred above. In reply to this argument, the learned counsel for the respondents have argued that no accident is proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as he has clearly admitted in his cross-examination that he reached the place of accident after about 10 or 15 minutes after the accident and the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped coming from the side of Jagraon. This argument seems to be correct. In case Mohinder Singh PW1 reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident, then it means that he did not witness the accident. No other witness has been examined by the claimants to prove the accident. The case of the claimants is that one Jagdish Lal also witnessed the accident, but he has not been examined by them for the reasons best known to them. The respondents have examined Kamikkar Singh driver, respondent No.4 in rebuttal as PW1. He has denied the allegations that the accident took place with his bus. Under these circumstances, there is no evidence on the file to prove that the accident took place with the bus which was FAO No.161 of 1988 4 being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver respondent No.4 and Gurmukh Singh received injuries in that accident. Thus, this issue remains un-proved and is decided against the claimants. During the pendency of the appeal, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants filed an application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC with the prayer to place on record a copy of the FIR No.30 dated 11.2.1987, registered at Police Station Civil Line Ludhiana, an hour after the accident. The accident had taken place at 5:30 p.m. and the FIR was lodged at 6:45 p.m. Vide a separate order passed today, the afore-mentioned application has been allowed as it was not brought on record before the Tribunal. Mr. Satinder Khanna, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants has argued that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in discarding the statement made by Mohinder Singh PW1 on the ground that he was not an eye witness as he reached the place of accident after 10-15 minutes is absolutely illegal. The version disclosed in the FIR would highlight that the deceased Gurmukh Singh was going in front of Mohinder Singh, the author of the FIR, on his Luna Moped bearing registration No.PJL 5057. Mohinder Singh was also following him on his own Luna No. PAL 9024. According to learned counsel, the statement made in the court was recorded after about 8 months and the detailed authentic version has been disclosed in the FIR lodged after about one hour. Learned counsel has emphasised that had the respondents desired, they could have confronted PW1 Mohinder Singh with this FIR where the version is different than the one disclosed in the statement made before the court. He has argued that once the driver of a vehicle is tried on account of rash and negligent driving it has to be prima-facie concluded that the accident was FAO No.161 of 1988 5 caused on account of rash and negligent driving, therefore, learned counsel has argued that the findings recorded by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 are liable to be reversed and it must be held that the accident has been caused on account of rash and negligent driving by Kamikkar Singh, driver- respondent No.4. Mr.S.K.Bhanot, learned State counsel has however, submitted that the tribunal has taken into account the statement made by the witness Mohinder Singh (PW1) admitting that he had reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes and that the place of accident was not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon. So he has submitted that the FIR cannot be taken into consideration unless it is proved either by its author or any other person. Therefore, it has been suggested that the FIR cannot be taken into account at this stage and the findings deserve to be upheld. Having heard learned counsel and perusing the record of the Tribunal, I am of the considered view that the findings recorded by the Tribunal cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. The Tribunal has stretched the statement of PW1 Mohinder Singh that he reached the place of accident -15 minutes later. The statement of Mohinder Singh PW1 infact no where suggests that he was not an eye witness to the accident. The relevant portions of the statement in chief and the cross-examination are as under:- On 11.2.87 at about 5:30 PM I was coming on the Moga Ludhiana road on a Luna Moped. When I was at some distance from Aarti Cinema towards Moga side, bus No.PJG 3108 came from the side of Moga. It was being driven at a very fast speed. Gurmukh Singh was also coming on a Luna Moped from the FAO No.161 of 1988 6 side of Moga. He was ahead of the bus. When Gurmukh Singh was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk the bus crushed him to death. The bus was being driven by Kamikkar Singh driver. The bus driver did not blow the horn. The bus was out of his control on account of the high speed. Gurmukh Singh was aged about 23 years. He died at the spot. One Jagdish Lal witnessed the accident. At about 8 PM the dead body of Gurmukh Singh was taken by us to Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, where it was subjected to post mortem examination.---------- The accident took place in that chowk when Gurmukh Singh was negotiating a turn on his right side to go to Gurdev Nagar. It is incorrect to suggest that there is a bus stop on the Ludhiana Moga road in between Aarti Cinema chowk and the Aarti cinema and all the buses coming from the side of Moga stop on that bus stop. It is correct that there is a rickshaw stand in between Arti Cinema and the chowk on the left side of the road while coming from Moga. Aarti Cinema chowk is a thickly populated area and there is great rush of vehicles on that part of the road. It is incorrect to suggest that Gurmukh Singh was struck down by a truck who ran away and the bus was wrongly involved while bus was stationary on the bus stop. It is also incorrect to suggest that I was not present at the place and time of accident.---------- I had not stated in my police statement that I and the deceased were going to that side in connection with the business of our FAO No.161 of 1988 7 shop. I did not see the deceased going in front of me. I saw him after the accident. I reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident. It is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on the side of the round about. The place of accident is that part of the round about of the chowk which faces Gurdev Nagar road. I saw him dead for the first time. Many persons had gathered there at the place of accident.---------- A perusal of the statement made by PW1 Mohinder Singh would show that the deceased was going on his Luna Moped ahead of the bus and not in front of the bus. He further stated that the deceased was taking turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk and at that time the bus crushed him to death which was being driven by driver-respondent No.4. He reiterated the statement when cross-examined by the learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 and denied the suggestion that Gurmukh Singh infact had struck against the truck which ran away, while the bus was stationary on the bus stop or that he was not present at the place and time of accident. During the cross-examination by driver-respondent No.4 the witness has stated that he did not see the deceased going in front of him, but there was no contradiction between the examination-in-chief and cross- examination. As such as in the examination-in-chief the witness had stated that the deceased was going ahead of the bus. The witness further stated that he saw the deceased after the accident and had reached the place of accident or 15 minutes after the accident. The afore mentioned statement made during cross-examination does not necessarily mean that the witness was FAO No.161 of 1988 8 giving an eye witness account. In fact, the witness was explaining the circumstantial evidence which lead to an inference that the deceased was killed in the accident on account of rash and negligent driving of bus by driver Kamikkar Singh, respondent No.4. The afore mentioned version finds support from the contents of the FIR recorded after about one hour. It shows that driver-respondent No.4, after hitting Gurmukh Singh, the deceased, stopped the bus at a distance and on coming to know about the death of Gurmukh Singh-deceased, he had run away. In these circumstances the statement made in the FIR if has been used for the purpose of contradiction can also be used for the purpose of corroboration. Such is the position of law under Section 162 of Criminal Procedure Code 1973. According to the proviso to Section 162(1) of Cr.P.C, if the statement made in the FIR is proved then the same may be used by the accused and with the permission of the Court by the prosecution to contradict a witness in the manner provided by Section 145 of Evidence Act, 1872 and that any part of the statement made in the FIR could also be used for corroboration. The principle incorporated by Section 162 Cr.P.C. would be applicable and the section itself ipso-facto may not apply. If that be so than the FIR and the statement made before the court read together would lead to only one conclusion that there were adequate circumstances supporting the inference that accident was caused by the offending bus which was being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Tribunal are liable to be set aside. Even otherwise this court has held in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham reported as 1993(2) PLR 109 that once a driver has been tried of an offence of rash and negligent driving, it is prima-facie safe to conclude that FAO No.161 of 1988 9 the accident had occurred on that account.

{"case_id": "Criminal Revision was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation to impugn the judgment dated 27.2.1996 rendered by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur. Complaint under Section 85(g) of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 ( hereinafter referred to as the Act ) was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation through its Insurance Inspector/ Manager, Local Office, Dhariwal, on the allegations that accused Rakesh Kumar Ohri (Proprietor) was and continued to be the Principal Employer of M/S. Raman & Company (Rice Mill), Awankhe Gate, near D.A.V.School, Dina Nagar in terms of Section 2(17) of the Act and at the time of committing of offence was in-charge and was responsible to the establishment for the superannuating of control of the business of the establishment. The accused has failed to produce the record, namely, wages/salaries registers, contribution registers, return of contributions, registers of employees' under Regulation 32 and other record pertaining to the payment of contributions, Inspection book, payment vouchers and ledgers and cash books for inspection before Insurance Inspector on 10.8.1993 and 22.9.1993 for the period from 1.7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Due to non- production of the record as mentioned above, accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Accused was summoned to face trial. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued. Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Accused moved an application dated 11.2.1995 for dropping the proceedings on the allegation that complaint was instituted after the expiry of period of limitation, as per Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. Notice was issued to the complainant. Ultimately, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, opined that complaint is not maintainable being time barred and was dismissed. Feeling dissatisfied with the order dated 27.2.1996 this revision petition was instituted. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the revisionist argued that main complaint was presented on 10.11.1993. After summoning, accused had appeared on 23.11.1994. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued on 5.1.1995. Under the Act, no limitation is provided. Maximum sentence under Section 85(g) of the Act is two years and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-. Contribution is every month. Due to non-deposit of contribution offence under Sectilon 85(g) is a continuing offence. Learned counsel for the revisionist cited ESIC Vs. C.C.Santhakumar, JT 2006(10) SC 549. Learned counsel for the respondent argued that as per Section 468 Cr.P.C. complaint was not within limitation. Court has no power to take cognizance beyond the expiry of limitation. Due to non-production of record, complaint should have been filed within six months. As per the Act, question of limitation can be agitated at any stage even after cognizance is taken. In the present case, cognizance was taken on 5.1.1995 when notice was issued. As per allegation of the revisionist, respondent failed to produce record pertaining to the payment of contributions, inspection book, payment vouchers, ledgers and cash book etc for investigation for the period from .7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Complaint was presented in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur on .11.1993. Notice was issued to the accused to appear in the Court. After appearance of the accused, on 23.11.1994, notice under Section 85(g) was issued on 5.1.1995. Record is silent as to on which date application for dropping proceedings under Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. were presented. Due to non-production of record, accused are liable for the commission of offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Section 85(g) of the Act is reproduced as under:- (g) is guilty of any contravention of or non- compliance with any of the requirements of this Act or the rules or the regulations in respect of which no special penalty is provided. ( he shall be punishable (i) where the commits an offence under clause (a), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years but- (a) which shall not be less than one year, in case of failure to pay the employee s contribution which has been deducted by him from the employee s wages and shall also be liable to fine of ten thousand rupees; (b) which shall not be less than six months, in any other case and shall also be liable to fine of five thousand rupees. Provided that the Court may, or any adequate and special reason to be recorded in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a lesser term. (ii) where he commits an offence under any of the clauses (b) to (g) (both inclusive), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to four thousand rupees, or with both.) In E.S.I.C. v. C.C. Santhakumar, JT 2006 (10) SC , the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:- 21. It is clear, therefore, that the right of the Corporation to recover these amounts by coercive process is not restricted by any limitation nor could be the Government by recourse to the rule-making power prescribed a period in the teeth of Section 68. . In the above judgment this Court has clearly held that Section 68 of the Act empowers the Corporation to resort to coercive process, to recover the contribution from the employer as if it were an arrear of land revenue and the said right is not restricted by any limitation. This is a crucial Section. . Similarly, no limitation is provided in Chapter VII. It deals with the imposition of penalty or levy of damages upon failure to pay contributions. It consists of Sections 84 to 86A. . When the Act itself does not provide for any limitation on the Corporation right to claim, the employers cannot rely upon Regulations 32 to , dealing with the period for maintenance of registers, to imply any limitation. Gurdeep Singh Vs. State and others, (3) 289 was relied by the learned trial Court for disposing of the application for dropping proceedings wherein it was held that: A. Delhi Police Act, 1978, Sections 93 and and 2 ( r)- Altercation took place inside the house No offence under Section 93 made out- Offence under Section 93 is made out if accused used any street or public place for threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intend to provoke breach of peace.

The trial Court had sentenced the appellant under Section 452 IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant was further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1 years under Section 376 IPC. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 of Police Station Sahlawas was present at Jhajjar, when the prosecutrix PW-1 (whose name has been withheld to protect her identity) along with her husband Nahnu Ram PW-5 appeared and made statement Ex.PA, on the basis of which FIR No.32 dated .05.1996 was registered at Police Station Sahlawas. The prosecutrix stated that her parents belong to Dadri Toe. About 11 months before the occurrence, she was married with Nahnu Ram. She was staying in her matrimonial home at village Chandol. She had set up a separate residence with her husband three months before the occurrence and her in-laws were residing in another house.

At about .00 p.m., she went to sleep in the courtyard after bolting the door of her house. She had retired to her bed after taking her meals. At about 11.00 p.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time, the present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had gagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear only. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her mouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied both of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in both the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were broken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide resistance.

In the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in- law Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was sent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm to her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house, since the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of the people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant along with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police.

{"case_id": "writ petitions in the High Court claiming revised scales of pay on the ground that they had taken graduate degrees and, therefore, were entitled to the benefit of the grade mentioned against Category `A' in the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957. In opposition to the writ petitions, the State Government contended that the letter did not contemplate the grant of the grade to all teachers but only to teachers appointed as Masters. The High Court held the teachers entitled to the benefit of the revised grade, whether or not they had been appointed as Masters, because, in the opinion of the High Court, the qualifying criterion was the possession of a graduate degree. The judgment of the High Court was affirmed by this Court in Kirpal Singh Bhatia (AIR 1976 SC 2459) (supra). The State Government found it difficult, having regard to the prevailing burden on its financial resources, to extend the benefit of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 to the much wider section of teachers covered in consequence of the Court's judgment.

{"case_id": "Appeal has been filed by the wife against the judgment dated 3.6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhatinda whereby a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for short the Act) on the ground of cruelty and desertion, preferred by the respondent husband, has been accepted and their marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce. [2]. The marriage between the parties was solemnized on 19.2.1973 at Patiala. At the time when the subject divorce petition was filed by the husband on 21.10.1991, they had three male children born out of the wedlock and they were about 18, 16 and 12 years of age respectively. In his -: 2 :- petition, the respondent alleged that the behaviour of the appellant towards the respondent and his old mother was indifferent from the very beginning; that she is suffering from some sort of mental disorder with the result that she refused to cook meals for him and the minor children; that she levelled false allegations qua the character of the respondent; that she gave severe beatings to the mother of the respondent on 22.9.1990 and that as a result thereof, he filed a divorce petition in which the appellant allegedly made a statement on 13.3.1991 that she will not misbehave in future with the respondent or his mother and undertook not to file any complaints against him either to the police or to the higher authorities of the Board; that the matter was compromised and the petition for dissolution of the marriage was withdrawn. [3]. The respondent has further averred that soon after the above stated compromise, the appellant allegedly refused to honour her words and started making false and frivolous complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda alleging that she had fear for her life at the hands of the respondent. The respondent alleged that he along with the children has been forced to live in the small rented house and that he has a vast circle of friends but the appellant allegedly refused to look after the visitors and forced the respondent to cook meals, clean utensils and wash the clothes of the children also . This fact was allegedly noticed by the relatives and friends of the respondent who used to visit the house thereby causing great mental cruelty to him as the respondent's reputation stood blotted. It was further alleged that the appellant in connivance with her father broke open the locks of the house which is under the possession of his mother and valuable articles were removed.... . It was also alleged that -: 3 :- the appellant threatened the respondent to get him physically liquidated . On the strength of these allegations, the respondent sought dissolution of their marriage by a decree of divorce. [4]. The appellant contested the above stated petition vide her reply dated 16.12.1992 and took a preliminary objection that the respondent in fact was taking advantage of his own wrongs as it was he who subjected her to cruelty even though she wanted to lead a honorable life with him. The appellant specifically averred that the respondent has deserted her with ulterior motive and has declined to give food and shelter . On merits, the appellant took the plea that soon after their marriage, the respondent started harassing her for bringing insufficient dowry and did not even attend the marriage of her brother held in the year 1974. She alleged that till the time her father-in-law was alive, the respondent used to behave reasonably well, however, after his death in the year 1978, he started beating her mercilessly and on many occasions refused to provide food or woolen clothes during winters. It was alleged that for the last over five years, the respondent has been continuously beating her so badly and ruthlessly that it has also affected her eye sight. She denied the allegations that she refused to cook food for the respondent, their children or her mother-in-law or that she ever made any false complaints against the respondent to the authorities. In para of the written statement, the appellant specifically alleged that in fact the respondent desired to re-marry and wanted to get rid of her . She further alleged that the previous divorce petition was withdrawn by the respondent after stating that he had compromised the matter and shall not beat her and will behave properly in future. In fact the divorce petition was withdrawn by him to avoid maintenance pendente-lite and litigation expenses. The -: 4 :- appellant specifically averred that she never refused to accompany the respondent, rather it is he who refused to take the respondent to his home . She further averred that since the respondent wanted to turn her out of the matrimonial home, he himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813", "outcome": "allowed", "confidence": 0.85, "source": "rule-based", "reasoning": "Rule matches: {'allowed': ['allowed', 'allow', 'set aside', 'granted', 'set aside', 'set aside'], 'quashed': ['set aside'], 'dismissed': ['fails']}; selected 'allowed' with score 6.85."}

{"case_id": "appeal filed under Section 110-D of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, challenges the award dated 8.10.1987 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana ( for brevity `MACT'). The Tribunal has recorded findings that the claimant/appellants have not been able to prove the accident or the fact that the deceased Gurmukh Singh received injuries on account of rash and negligent driving of the bus by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. The Tribunal has further held that the claimant/appellants were the legal representatives of deceased Gurmukh Singh and that the income of deceased Gurmukh Singh was Rs.650/- per FAO No.161 of 1988 2 month and the dependency has been worked out at Rs.200/- per month. A multiplier of 15 has been applied. The father of the deceased claimant/appellant No.1 has been found to be 50 years of age and mother of the deceased claimant/appellant No.2 has been found to be 45 years of age. The other claimants were the brother and sister. However, only Daljit Kaur, minor, who was 16 years of age, has filed the appeal being claimant/appellant No.3. The deceased was 23 years of age at the time of his death and was post graduate. Accordingly a multiplier of 15 was applied and a total claim of Rs.36,000/- as compensation was calculated. However, on account of the fact that the claimant/appellants had failed to prove the accident, their claim application was dismissed. It would be appropriate to make a reference to the analysis of evidence undertaken by the tribunal to reach the conclusion that the accident did not take place on 11.2.1987 at :30 p.m. The same reads as under:- In support of this issue, the claimants have examined Mohinder Singh, PW1. He has stated that on 11.2.1987 at about 5:30 PM he was coming on a Luna Moped on Moga- Ludhiana road and when he was at some distance from Aarti Cinema Chowk towards Moga side the bus came from the side of Moga which was being driven at a very fast speed and at that time the deceased was also going on a Luna Moped from the side of Moga and he was crushed by the bus driver under the bus when he was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk to go to Gurdev Nagar. In his cross- examination, he has stated that he did not see the deceased Gurmukh Singh going in front of him and he saw him for the FAO No.161 of 1988 3 first time after the accident and that he reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes of the accident. He has further admitted that it is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on that side of the round about which faces Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana. The learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the accident stands proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as referred above. In reply to this argument, the learned counsel for the respondents have argued that no accident is proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as he has clearly admitted in his cross-examination that he reached the place of accident after about 10 or 15 minutes after the accident and the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped coming from the side of Jagraon. This argument seems to be correct. In case Mohinder Singh PW1 reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident, then it means that he did not witness the accident. No other witness has been examined by the claimants to prove the accident. The case of the claimants is that one Jagdish Lal also witnessed the accident, but he has not been examined by them for the reasons best known to them. The respondents have examined Kamikkar Singh driver, respondent No.4 in rebuttal as PW1. He has denied the allegations that the accident took place with his bus. Under these circumstances, there is no evidence on the file to prove that the accident took place with the bus which was FAO No.161 of 1988 4 being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver respondent No.4 and Gurmukh Singh received injuries in that accident. Thus, this issue remains un-proved and is decided against the claimants. During the pendency of the appeal, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants filed an application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC with the prayer to place on record a copy of the FIR No.30 dated 11.2.1987, registered at Police Station Civil Line Ludhiana, an hour after the accident. The accident had taken place at 5:30 p.m. and the FIR was lodged at 6:45 p.m. Vide a separate order passed today, the afore-mentioned application has been allowed as it was not brought on record before the Tribunal. Mr. Satinder Khanna, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants has argued that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in discarding the statement made by Mohinder Singh PW1 on the ground that he was not an eye witness as he reached the place of accident after 10-15 minutes is absolutely illegal. The version disclosed in the FIR would highlight that the deceased Gurmukh Singh was going in front of Mohinder Singh, the author of the FIR, on his Luna Moped bearing registration No.PJL 5057. Mohinder Singh was also following him on his own Luna No. PAL 9024. According to learned counsel, the statement made in the court was recorded after about 8 months and the detailed authentic version has been disclosed in the FIR lodged after about one hour. Learned counsel has emphasised that had the respondents desired, they could have confronted PW1 Mohinder Singh with this FIR where the version is different than the one disclosed in the statement made before the court. He has argued that once the driver of a vehicle is tried on account of rash and negligent driving it has to be prima-facie concluded that the accident was FAO No.161 of 1988 5 caused on account of rash and negligent driving, therefore, learned counsel has argued that the findings recorded by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 are liable to be reversed and it must be held that the accident has been caused on account of rash and negligent driving by Kamikkar Singh, driver- respondent No.4. Mr.S.K.Bhanot, learned State counsel has however, submitted that the tribunal has taken into account the statement made by the witness Mohinder Singh (PW1) admitting that he had reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes and that the place of accident was not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon. So he has submitted that the FIR cannot be taken into consideration unless it is proved either by its author or any other person. Therefore, it has been suggested that the FIR cannot be taken into account at this stage and the findings deserve to be upheld. Having heard learned counsel and perusing the record of the Tribunal, I am of the considered view that the findings recorded by the Tribunal cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. The Tribunal has stretched the statement of PW1 Mohinder Singh that he reached the place of accident -15 minutes later. The statement of Mohinder Singh PW1 infact no where suggests that he was not an eye witness to the accident. The relevant portions of the statement in chief and the cross-examination are as under:- On 11.2.87 at about 5:30 PM I was coming on the Moga Ludhiana road on a Luna Moped. When I was at some distance from Aarti Cinema towards Moga side, bus No.PJG 3108 came from the side of Moga. It was being driven at a very fast speed. Gurmukh Singh was also coming on a Luna Moped from the FAO No.161 of 1988 6 side of Moga. He was ahead of the bus. When Gurmukh Singh was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk the bus crushed him to death. The bus was being driven by Kamikkar Singh driver. The bus driver did not blow the horn. The bus was out of his control on account of the high speed. Gurmukh Singh was aged about 23 years. He died at the spot. One Jagdish Lal witnessed the accident. At about 8 PM the dead body of Gurmukh Singh was taken by us to Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, where it was subjected to post mortem examination.---------- The accident took place in that chowk when Gurmukh Singh was negotiating a turn on his right side to go to Gurdev Nagar. It is incorrect to suggest that there is a bus stop on the Ludhiana Moga road in between Aarti Cinema chowk and the Aarti cinema and all the buses coming from the side of Moga stop on that bus stop. It is correct that there is a rickshaw stand in between Arti Cinema and the chowk on the left side of the road while coming from Moga. Aarti Cinema chowk is a thickly populated area and there is great rush of vehicles on that part of the road. It is incorrect to suggest that Gurmukh Singh was struck down by a truck who ran away and the bus was wrongly involved while bus was stationary on the bus stop. It is also incorrect to suggest that I was not present at the place and time of accident.---------- I had not stated in my police statement that I and the deceased were going to that side in connection with the business of our FAO No.161 of 1988 7 shop. I did not see the deceased going in front of me. I saw him after the accident. I reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident. It is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on the side of the round about. The place of accident is that part of the round about of the chowk which faces Gurdev Nagar road. I saw him dead for the first time. Many persons had gathered there at the place of accident.---------- A perusal of the statement made by PW1 Mohinder Singh would show that the deceased was going on his Luna Moped ahead of the bus and not in front of the bus. He further stated that the deceased was taking turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk and at that time the bus crushed him to death which was being driven by driver-respondent No.4. He reiterated the statement when cross-examined by the learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 and denied the suggestion that Gurmukh Singh infact had struck against the truck which ran away, while the bus was stationary on the bus stop or that he was not present at the place and time of accident. During the cross-examination by driver-respondent No.4 the witness has stated that he did not see the deceased going in front of him, but there was no contradiction between the examination-in-chief and cross- examination. As such as in the examination-in-chief the witness had stated that the deceased was going ahead of the bus. The witness further stated that he saw the deceased after the accident and had reached the place of accident or 15 minutes after the accident. The afore mentioned statement made during cross-examination does not necessarily mean that the witness was FAO No.161 of 1988 8 giving an eye witness account. In fact, the witness was explaining the circumstantial evidence which lead to an inference that the deceased was killed in the accident on account of rash and negligent driving of bus by driver Kamikkar Singh, respondent No.4. The afore mentioned version finds support from the contents of the FIR recorded after about one hour. It shows that driver-respondent No.4, after hitting Gurmukh Singh, the deceased, stopped the bus at a distance and on coming to know about the death of Gurmukh Singh-deceased, he had run away. In these circumstances the statement made in the FIR if has been used for the purpose of contradiction can also be used for the purpose of corroboration. Such is the position of law under Section 162 of Criminal Procedure Code 1973. According to the proviso to Section 162(1) of Cr.P.C, if the statement made in the FIR is proved then the same may be used by the accused and with the permission of the Court by the prosecution to contradict a witness in the manner provided by Section 145 of Evidence Act, 1872 and that any part of the statement made in the FIR could also be used for corroboration. The principle incorporated by Section 162 Cr.P.C. would be applicable and the section itself ipso-facto may not apply. If that be so than the FIR and the statement made before the court read together would lead to only one conclusion that there were adequate circumstances supporting the inference that accident was caused by the offending bus which was being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Tribunal are liable to be set aside. Even otherwise this court has held in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham reported as 1993(2) PLR 109 that once a driver has been tried of an offence of rash and negligent driving, it is prima-facie safe to conclude that FAO No.161 of 1988 9 the accident had occurred on that account.

{"case_id": "Criminal Revision was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation to impugn the judgment dated 27.2.1996 rendered by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur. Complaint under Section 85(g) of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 ( hereinafter referred to as the Act ) was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation through its Insurance Inspector/ Manager, Local Office, Dhariwal, on the allegations that accused Rakesh Kumar Ohri (Proprietor) was and continued to be the Principal Employer of M/S. Raman & Company (Rice Mill), Awankhe Gate, near D.A.V.School, Dina Nagar in terms of Section 2(17) of the Act and at the time of committing of offence was in-charge and was responsible to the establishment for the superannuating of control of the business of the establishment. The accused has failed to produce the record, namely, wages/salaries registers, contribution registers, return of contributions, registers of employees' under Regulation 32 and other record pertaining to the payment of contributions, Inspection book, payment vouchers and ledgers and cash books for inspection before Insurance Inspector on 10.8.1993 and 22.9.1993 for the period from 1.7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Due to non- production of the record as mentioned above, accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Accused was summoned to face trial. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued. Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Accused moved an application dated 11.2.1995 for dropping the proceedings on the allegation that complaint was instituted after the expiry of period of limitation, as per Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. Notice was issued to the complainant. Ultimately, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, opined that complaint is not maintainable being time barred and was dismissed. Feeling dissatisfied with the order dated 27.2.1996 this revision petition was instituted. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the revisionist argued that main complaint was presented on 10.11.1993. After summoning, accused had appeared on 23.11.1994. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued on 5.1.1995. Under the Act, no limitation is provided. Maximum sentence under Section 85(g) of the Act is two years and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-. Contribution is every month. Due to non-deposit of contribution offence under Sectilon 85(g) is a continuing offence. Learned counsel for the revisionist cited ESIC Vs. C.C.Santhakumar, JT 2006(10) SC 549. Learned counsel for the respondent argued that as per Section 468 Cr.P.C. complaint was not within limitation. Court has no power to take cognizance beyond the expiry of limitation. Due to non-production of record, complaint should have been filed within six months. As per the Act, question of limitation can be agitated at any stage even after cognizance is taken. In the present case, cognizance was taken on 5.1.1995 when notice was issued. As per allegation of the revisionist, respondent failed to produce record pertaining to the payment of contributions, inspection book, payment vouchers, ledgers and cash book etc for investigation for the period from .7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Complaint was presented in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur on .11.1993. Notice was issued to the accused to appear in the Court. After appearance of the accused, on 23.11.1994, notice under Section 85(g) was issued on 5.1.1995. Record is silent as to on which date application for dropping proceedings under Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. were presented. Due to non-production of record, accused are liable for the commission of offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Section 85(g) of the Act is reproduced as under:- (g) is guilty of any contravention of or non- compliance with any of the requirements of this Act or the rules or the regulations in respect of which no special penalty is provided. ( he shall be punishable (i) where the commits an offence under clause (a), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years but- (a) which shall not be less than one year, in case of failure to pay the employee s contribution which has been deducted by him from the employee s wages and shall also be liable to fine of ten thousand rupees; (b) which shall not be less than six months, in any other case and shall also be liable to fine of five thousand rupees. Provided that the Court may, or any adequate and special reason to be recorded in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a lesser term. (ii) where he commits an offence under any of the clauses (b) to (g) (both inclusive), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to four thousand rupees, or with both.) In E.S.I.C. v. C.C. Santhakumar, JT 2006 (10) SC , the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:- 21. It is clear, therefore, that the right of the Corporation to recover these amounts by coercive process is not restricted by any limitation nor could be the Government by recourse to the rule-making power prescribed a period in the teeth of Section 68. . In the above judgment this Court has clearly held that Section 68 of the Act empowers the Corporation to resort to coercive process, to recover the contribution from the employer as if it were an arrear of land revenue and the said right is not restricted by any limitation. This is a crucial Section. . Similarly, no limitation is provided in Chapter VII. It deals with the imposition of penalty or levy of damages upon failure to pay contributions. It consists of Sections 84 to 86A. . When the Act itself does not provide for any limitation on the Corporation right to claim, the employers cannot rely upon Regulations 32 to , dealing with the period for maintenance of registers, to imply any limitation. Gurdeep Singh Vs. State and others, (3) 289 was relied by the learned trial Court for disposing of the application for dropping proceedings wherein it was held that: A. Delhi Police Act, 1978, Sections 93 and and 2 ( r)- Altercation took place inside the house No offence under Section 93 made out- Offence under Section 93 is made out if accused used any street or public place for threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intend to provoke breach of peace.

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate for the appellant. Ms. Hemlata Balhara, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana for the State. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. Taqdir Singh son of Lehri Singh has preferred the present appeal and has challenged the judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 30th July, 1998, whereby he was held guilty of offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The trial Court had sentenced the appellant under Section 452 IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant was further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1 years under Section 376 IPC. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 of Police Station Sahlawas was present at Jhajjar, when the prosecutrix PW-1 (whose name has been withheld to protect her identity) along with her husband Nahnu Ram PW-5 appeared and made statement Ex.PA, on the basis of which FIR No.32 dated .05.1996 was registered at Police Station Sahlawas. The prosecutrix stated that her parents belong to Dadri Toe. About 11 months before the occurrence, she was married with Nahnu Ram. She was staying in her matrimonial home at village Chandol. She had set up a separate residence with her husband three months before the occurrence and her in-laws were residing in another house. On 3rd May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m. her husband had gone to village Bhakli to do the work of Halwai (sweet maker) in a marriage and she was alone at her house. At about .00 p.m., she went to sleep in the courtyard after bolting the door of her house. She had retired to her bed after taking her meals. At about 11.00 p.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time, the present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had gagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear only. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her mouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied both of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in both the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were broken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide resistance. The accused had broken the string of Salwar of the prosecutrix, removed her panty and forcibly committed sexual intercourse upon her. After the occurrence, the accused untied the hands of the prosecutrix, removed the cloth from her face and ran away from the spot. In the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in- law Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was sent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm to her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house, since the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of the people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant along with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police. She was going to the Police Station to lodge the report when the police officials met her and she got her statement recorded. It was further stated that Taqdir had left his house from the day of incident and was not available. In the present case, occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, at about 11.00 p.m. The prosecutrix had made statement Ex.PA to ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 on 7th May, 1996 at 1.20 p.m. Case was registered at Police Station Sahlawas on 7th May, 1996 at 3.30 p.m. The above said FIR was investigated and report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted against the accused appellant. The case, along with the accused, was committed to the Court of Sessions Judge, Rohtak and was entrusted for trial to the Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Rohtak. On 19th September, 1996, the trial Judge charged the appellant for offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The charge stated that on 3rd May, 1996 at about 11.00 p.m. in the area of village Chandol, the appellant committed house-trespass by entering the house of the prosecutrix, used as human dwelling, having made preparation to wrongfully restrain the prosecutrix and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 452 IPC. It was further stated that on the same day, time and place, he had committed offence of rape punishable under Section 376 IPC. The appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Prosecutrix appeared as PW-1 and reiterated as to what was stated in her statement Ex.PA, contents of which have been noticed above. She further sated that Taqdir was her neighbour. In cross examination, this witness admitted that her mother had got a case registered against Hari Singh and Smt. Bala wife of Hari Singh on the accusation that Hari Singh had given a kick blow in the stomach of mother of the prosecutrix, due to which she got aborted and the child died. She denied the suggestion that earlier her mother had compromised the matter after acceptance of money. This witness further stated that when the accused appeared near her cot, he was having a 5 feet long Parna (cloth) in his hand. She further stated that the elder brother of her husband was sent to relay the information to her husband. She further deposed that due to breakage of her bangles at the time of incident, she had sustained injuries on her arm s skin but the injuries did not bleed. It was stated that her underwear and Salwar were stained with semen. The police had taken into possession the broken bangles, ring and clothes from the house of prosecutrix. She denied the suggestion that she had lodged false case against the accused to save Bansi son of Sube, a driver and accused in a case under Section 377 IPC.

{"case_id": "writ petitions in the High Court claiming revised scales of pay on the ground that they had taken graduate degrees and, therefore, were entitled to the benefit of the grade mentioned against Category `A' in the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957. In opposition to the writ petitions, the State Government contended that the letter did not contemplate the grant of the grade to all teachers but only to teachers appointed as Masters. The High Court held the teachers entitled to the benefit of the revised grade, whether or not they had been appointed as Masters, because, in the opinion of the High Court, the qualifying criterion was the possession of a graduate degree. The judgment of the High Court was affirmed by this Court in Kirpal Singh Bhatia (AIR 1976 SC 2459) (supra). The State Government found it difficult, having regard to the prevailing burden on its financial resources, to extend the benefit of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 to the much wider section of teachers covered in consequence of the Court's judgment.

{"case_id": "Appeal has been filed by the wife against the judgment dated 3.6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhatinda whereby a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for short the Act) on the ground of cruelty and desertion, preferred by the respondent husband, has been accepted and their marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce. [2]. The marriage between the parties was solemnized on 19.2.1973 at Patiala. At the time when the subject divorce petition was filed by the husband on 21.10.1991, they had three male children born out of the wedlock and they were about 18, 16 and 12 years of age respectively. In his -: 2 :- petition, the respondent alleged that the behaviour of the appellant towards the respondent and his old mother was indifferent from the very beginning; that she is suffering from some sort of mental disorder with the result that she refused to cook meals for him and the minor children; that she levelled false allegations qua the character of the respondent; that she gave severe beatings to the mother of the respondent on 22.9.1990 and that as a result thereof, he filed a divorce petition in which the appellant allegedly made a statement on 13.3.1991 that she will not misbehave in future with the respondent or his mother and undertook not to file any complaints against him either to the police or to the higher authorities of the Board; that the matter was compromised and the petition for dissolution of the marriage was withdrawn. [3]. The respondent has further averred that soon after the above stated compromise, the appellant allegedly refused to honour her words and started making false and frivolous complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda alleging that she had fear for her life at the hands of the respondent. The respondent alleged that he along with the children has been forced to live in the small rented house and that he has a vast circle of friends but the appellant allegedly refused to look after the visitors and forced the respondent to cook meals, clean utensils and wash the clothes of the children also . This fact was allegedly noticed by the relatives and friends of the respondent who used to visit the house thereby causing great mental cruelty to him as the respondent's reputation stood blotted. It was further alleged that the appellant in connivance with her father broke open the locks of the house which is under the possession of his mother and valuable articles were removed.... . It was also alleged that -: 3 :- the appellant threatened the respondent to get him physically liquidated . On the strength of these allegations, the respondent sought dissolution of their marriage by a decree of divorce. [4]. The appellant contested the above stated petition vide her reply dated 16.12.1992 and took a preliminary objection that the respondent in fact was taking advantage of his own wrongs as it was he who subjected her to cruelty even though she wanted to lead a honorable life with him. The appellant specifically averred that the respondent has deserted her with ulterior motive and has declined to give food and shelter . On merits, the appellant took the plea that soon after their marriage, the respondent started harassing her for bringing insufficient dowry and did not even attend the marriage of her brother held in the year 1974. She alleged that till the time her father-in-law was alive, the respondent used to behave reasonably well, however, after his death in the year 1978, he started beating her mercilessly and on many occasions refused to provide food or woolen clothes during winters. It was alleged that for the last over five years, the respondent has been continuously beating her so badly and ruthlessly that it has also affected her eye sight. She denied the allegations that she refused to cook food for the respondent, their children or her mother-in-law or that she ever made any false complaints against the respondent to the authorities. In para of the written statement, the appellant specifically alleged that in fact the respondent desired to re-marry and wanted to get rid of her . She further alleged that the previous divorce petition was withdrawn by the respondent after stating that he had compromised the matter and shall not beat her and will behave properly in future. In fact the divorce petition was withdrawn by him to avoid maintenance pendente-lite and litigation expenses. The -: 4 :- appellant specifically averred that she never refused to accompany the respondent, rather it is he who refused to take the respondent to his home . She further averred that since the respondent wanted to turn her out of the matrimonial home, he himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813", "outcome": "allowed", "confidence": 0.85, "source": "rule-based", "reasoning": "Rule matches: {'allowed': ['allowed', 'allow', 'set aside', 'granted', 'set aside', 'set aside'], 'quashed': ['set aside'], 'dismissed': ['fails']}; selected 'allowed' with score 6.85."}

{"case_id": "appeal filed under Section 110-D of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, challenges the award dated 8.10.1987 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana ( for brevity `MACT'). The Tribunal has recorded findings that the claimant/appellants have not been able to prove the accident or the fact that the deceased Gurmukh Singh received injuries on account of rash and negligent driving of the bus by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. The Tribunal has further held that the claimant/appellants were the legal representatives of deceased Gurmukh Singh and that the income of deceased Gurmukh Singh was Rs.650/- per FAO No.161 of 1988 2 month and the dependency has been worked out at Rs.200/- per month. A multiplier of 15 has been applied. The father of the deceased claimant/appellant No.1 has been found to be 50 years of age and mother of the deceased claimant/appellant No.2 has been found to be 45 years of age. The other claimants were the brother and sister. However, only Daljit Kaur, minor, who was 16 years of age, has filed the appeal being claimant/appellant No.3. The deceased was 23 years of age at the time of his death and was post graduate. Accordingly a multiplier of 15 was applied and a total claim of Rs.36,000/- as compensation was calculated. However, on account of the fact that the claimant/appellants had failed to prove the accident, their claim application was dismissed. It would be appropriate to make a reference to the analysis of evidence undertaken by the tribunal to reach the conclusion that the accident did not take place on 11.2.1987 at :30 p.m. The same reads as under:- In support of this issue, the claimants have examined Mohinder Singh, PW1. He has stated that on 11.2.1987 at about 5:30 PM he was coming on a Luna Moped on Moga- Ludhiana road and when he was at some distance from Aarti Cinema Chowk towards Moga side the bus came from the side of Moga which was being driven at a very fast speed and at that time the deceased was also going on a Luna Moped from the side of Moga and he was crushed by the bus driver under the bus when he was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk to go to Gurdev Nagar. In his cross- examination, he has stated that he did not see the deceased Gurmukh Singh going in front of him and he saw him for the FAO No.161 of 1988 3 first time after the accident and that he reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes of the accident. He has further admitted that it is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on that side of the round about which faces Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana. The learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the accident stands proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as referred above. In reply to this argument, the learned counsel for the respondents have argued that no accident is proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as he has clearly admitted in his cross-examination that he reached the place of accident after about 10 or 15 minutes after the accident and the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped coming from the side of Jagraon. This argument seems to be correct. In case Mohinder Singh PW1 reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident, then it means that he did not witness the accident. No other witness has been examined by the claimants to prove the accident. The case of the claimants is that one Jagdish Lal also witnessed the accident, but he has not been examined by them for the reasons best known to them. The respondents have examined Kamikkar Singh driver, respondent No.4 in rebuttal as PW1. He has denied the allegations that the accident took place with his bus. Under these circumstances, there is no evidence on the file to prove that the accident took place with the bus which was FAO No.161 of 1988 4 being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver respondent No.4 and Gurmukh Singh received injuries in that accident. Thus, this issue remains un-proved and is decided against the claimants. During the pendency of the appeal, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants filed an application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC with the prayer to place on record a copy of the FIR No.30 dated 11.2.1987, registered at Police Station Civil Line Ludhiana, an hour after the accident. The accident had taken place at 5:30 p.m. and the FIR was lodged at 6:45 p.m. Vide a separate order passed today, the afore-mentioned application has been allowed as it was not brought on record before the Tribunal. Mr. Satinder Khanna, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants has argued that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in discarding the statement made by Mohinder Singh PW1 on the ground that he was not an eye witness as he reached the place of accident after 10-15 minutes is absolutely illegal. The version disclosed in the FIR would highlight that the deceased Gurmukh Singh was going in front of Mohinder Singh, the author of the FIR, on his Luna Moped bearing registration No.PJL 5057. Mohinder Singh was also following him on his own Luna No. PAL 9024. According to learned counsel, the statement made in the court was recorded after about 8 months and the detailed authentic version has been disclosed in the FIR lodged after about one hour. Learned counsel has emphasised that had the respondents desired, they could have confronted PW1 Mohinder Singh with this FIR where the version is different than the one disclosed in the statement made before the court. He has argued that once the driver of a vehicle is tried on account of rash and negligent driving it has to be prima-facie concluded that the accident was FAO No.161 of 1988 5 caused on account of rash and negligent driving, therefore, learned counsel has argued that the findings recorded by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 are liable to be reversed and it must be held that the accident has been caused on account of rash and negligent driving by Kamikkar Singh, driver- respondent No.4. Mr.S.K.Bhanot, learned State counsel has however, submitted that the tribunal has taken into account the statement made by the witness Mohinder Singh (PW1) admitting that he had reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes and that the place of accident was not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon. So he has submitted that the FIR cannot be taken into consideration unless it is proved either by its author or any other person. Therefore, it has been suggested that the FIR cannot be taken into account at this stage and the findings deserve to be upheld. Having heard learned counsel and perusing the record of the Tribunal, I am of the considered view that the findings recorded by the Tribunal cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. The Tribunal has stretched the statement of PW1 Mohinder Singh that he reached the place of accident -15 minutes later. The statement of Mohinder Singh PW1 infact no where suggests that he was not an eye witness to the accident. The relevant portions of the statement in chief and the cross-examination are as under:- On 11.2.87 at about 5:30 PM I was coming on the Moga Ludhiana road on a Luna Moped. When I was at some distance from Aarti Cinema towards Moga side, bus No.PJG 3108 came from the side of Moga. It was being driven at a very fast speed. Gurmukh Singh was also coming on a Luna Moped from the FAO No.161 of 1988 6 side of Moga. He was ahead of the bus. When Gurmukh Singh was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk the bus crushed him to death. The bus was being driven by Kamikkar Singh driver. The bus driver did not blow the horn. The bus was out of his control on account of the high speed. Gurmukh Singh was aged about 23 years. He died at the spot. One Jagdish Lal witnessed the accident. At about 8 PM the dead body of Gurmukh Singh was taken by us to Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, where it was subjected to post mortem examination.---------- The accident took place in that chowk when Gurmukh Singh was negotiating a turn on his right side to go to Gurdev Nagar. It is incorrect to suggest that there is a bus stop on the Ludhiana Moga road in between Aarti Cinema chowk and the Aarti cinema and all the buses coming from the side of Moga stop on that bus stop. It is correct that there is a rickshaw stand in between Arti Cinema and the chowk on the left side of the road while coming from Moga. Aarti Cinema chowk is a thickly populated area and there is great rush of vehicles on that part of the road. It is incorrect to suggest that Gurmukh Singh was struck down by a truck who ran away and the bus was wrongly involved while bus was stationary on the bus stop. It is also incorrect to suggest that I was not present at the place and time of accident.---------- I had not stated in my police statement that I and the deceased were going to that side in connection with the business of our FAO No.161 of 1988 7 shop. I did not see the deceased going in front of me. I saw him after the accident. I reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident. It is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on the side of the round about. The place of accident is that part of the round about of the chowk which faces Gurdev Nagar road. I saw him dead for the first time. Many persons had gathered there at the place of accident.---------- A perusal of the statement made by PW1 Mohinder Singh would show that the deceased was going on his Luna Moped ahead of the bus and not in front of the bus. He further stated that the deceased was taking turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk and at that time the bus crushed him to death which was being driven by driver-respondent No.4. He reiterated the statement when cross-examined by the learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 and denied the suggestion that Gurmukh Singh infact had struck against the truck which ran away, while the bus was stationary on the bus stop or that he was not present at the place and time of accident. During the cross-examination by driver-respondent No.4 the witness has stated that he did not see the deceased going in front of him, but there was no contradiction between the examination-in-chief and cross- examination. As such as in the examination-in-chief the witness had stated that the deceased was going ahead of the bus. The witness further stated that he saw the deceased after the accident and had reached the place of accident or 15 minutes after the accident. The afore mentioned statement made during cross-examination does not necessarily mean that the witness was FAO No.161 of 1988 8 giving an eye witness account. In fact, the witness was explaining the circumstantial evidence which lead to an inference that the deceased was killed in the accident on account of rash and negligent driving of bus by driver Kamikkar Singh, respondent No.4. The afore mentioned version finds support from the contents of the FIR recorded after about one hour. It shows that driver-respondent No.4, after hitting Gurmukh Singh, the deceased, stopped the bus at a distance and on coming to know about the death of Gurmukh Singh-deceased, he had run away. In these circumstances the statement made in the FIR if has been used for the purpose of contradiction can also be used for the purpose of corroboration. Such is the position of law under Section 162 of Criminal Procedure Code 1973. According to the proviso to Section 162(1) of Cr.P.C, if the statement made in the FIR is proved then the same may be used by the accused and with the permission of the Court by the prosecution to contradict a witness in the manner provided by Section 145 of Evidence Act, 1872 and that any part of the statement made in the FIR could also be used for corroboration. The principle incorporated by Section 162 Cr.P.C. would be applicable and the section itself ipso-facto may not apply. If that be so than the FIR and the statement made before the court read together would lead to only one conclusion that there were adequate circumstances supporting the inference that accident was caused by the offending bus which was being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Tribunal are liable to be set aside. Even otherwise this court has held in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham reported as 1993(2) PLR 109 that once a driver has been tried of an offence of rash and negligent driving, it is prima-facie safe to conclude that FAO No.161 of 1988 9 the accident had occurred on that account.

{"case_id": "Criminal Revision was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation to impugn the judgment dated 27.2.1996 rendered by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur. Complaint under Section 85(g) of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 ( hereinafter referred to as the Act ) was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation through its Insurance Inspector/ Manager, Local Office, Dhariwal, on the allegations that accused Rakesh Kumar Ohri (Proprietor) was and continued to be the Principal Employer of M/S. Raman & Company (Rice Mill), Awankhe Gate, near D.A.V.School, Dina Nagar in terms of Section 2(17) of the Act and at the time of committing of offence was in-charge and was responsible to the establishment for the superannuating of control of the business of the establishment. The accused has failed to produce the record, namely, wages/salaries registers, contribution registers, return of contributions, registers of employees' under Regulation 32 and other record pertaining to the payment of contributions, Inspection book, payment vouchers and ledgers and cash books for inspection before Insurance Inspector on 10.8.1993 and 22.9.1993 for the period from 1.7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Due to non- production of the record as mentioned above, accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Accused was summoned to face trial. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued. Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Accused moved an application dated 11.2.1995 for dropping the proceedings on the allegation that complaint was instituted after the expiry of period of limitation, as per Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. Notice was issued to the complainant. Ultimately, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, opined that complaint is not maintainable being time barred and was dismissed. Feeling dissatisfied with the order dated 27.2.1996 this revision petition was instituted. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the revisionist argued that main complaint was presented on 10.11.1993. After summoning, accused had appeared on 23.11.1994. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued on 5.1.1995. Under the Act, no limitation is provided. Maximum sentence under Section 85(g) of the Act is two years and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-. Contribution is every month. Due to non-deposit of contribution offence under Sectilon 85(g) is a continuing offence. Learned counsel for the revisionist cited ESIC Vs. C.C.Santhakumar, JT 2006(10) SC 549. Learned counsel for the respondent argued that as per Section 468 Cr.P.C. complaint was not within limitation. Court has no power to take cognizance beyond the expiry of limitation. Due to non-production of record, complaint should have been filed within six months. As per the Act, question of limitation can be agitated at any stage even after cognizance is taken. In the present case, cognizance was taken on 5.1.1995 when notice was issued. As per allegation of the revisionist, respondent failed to produce record pertaining to the payment of contributions, inspection book, payment vouchers, ledgers and cash book etc for investigation for the period from .7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Complaint was presented in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur on .11.1993. Notice was issued to the accused to appear in the Court. After appearance of the accused, on 23.11.1994, notice under Section 85(g) was issued on 5.1.1995. Record is silent as to on which date application for dropping proceedings under Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. were presented. Due to non-production of record, accused are liable for the commission of offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Section 85(g) of the Act is reproduced as under:- (g) is guilty of any contravention of or non- compliance with any of the requirements of this Act or the rules or the regulations in respect of which no special penalty is provided. ( he shall be punishable (i) where the commits an offence under clause (a), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years but- (a) which shall not be less than one year, in case of failure to pay the employee s contribution which has been deducted by him from the employee s wages and shall also be liable to fine of ten thousand rupees; (b) which shall not be less than six months, in any other case and shall also be liable to fine of five thousand rupees. Provided that the Court may, or any adequate and special reason to be recorded in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a lesser term. (ii) where he commits an offence under any of the clauses (b) to (g) (both inclusive), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to four thousand rupees, or with both.) In E.S.I.C. v. C.C. Santhakumar, JT 2006 (10) SC , the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:- 21. It is clear, therefore, that the right of the Corporation to recover these amounts by coercive process is not restricted by any limitation nor could be the Government by recourse to the rule-making power prescribed a period in the teeth of Section 68. . In the above judgment this Court has clearly held that Section 68 of the Act empowers the Corporation to resort to coercive process, to recover the contribution from the employer as if it were an arrear of land revenue and the said right is not restricted by any limitation.

{"case_id": "writ petitions in the High Court claiming revised scales of pay on the ground that they had taken graduate degrees and, therefore, were entitled to the benefit of the grade mentioned against Category `A' in the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957. In opposition to the writ petitions, the State Government contended that the letter did not contemplate the grant of the grade to all teachers but only to teachers appointed as Masters. The High Court held the teachers entitled to the benefit of the revised grade, whether or not they had been appointed as Masters, because, in the opinion of the High Court, the qualifying criterion was the possession of a graduate degree. The judgment of the High Court was affirmed by this Court in Kirpal Singh Bhatia (AIR 1976 SC 2459) (supra). The State Government found it difficult, having regard to the prevailing burden on its financial resources, to extend the benefit of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 to the much wider section of teachers covered in consequence of the Court's judgment.

{"case_id": "Appeal has been filed by the wife against the judgment dated 3.6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhatinda whereby a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for short the Act) on the ground of cruelty and desertion, preferred by the respondent husband, has been accepted and their marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce. [2]. The marriage between the parties was solemnized on 19.2.1973 at Patiala. At the time when the subject divorce petition was filed by the husband on 21.10.1991, they had three male children born out of the wedlock and they were about 18, 16 and 12 years of age respectively. In his -: 2 :- petition, the respondent alleged that the behaviour of the appellant towards the respondent and his old mother was indifferent from the very beginning; that she is suffering from some sort of mental disorder with the result that she refused to cook meals for him and the minor children; that she levelled false allegations qua the character of the respondent; that she gave severe beatings to the mother of the respondent on 22.9.1990 and that as a result thereof, he filed a divorce petition in which the appellant allegedly made a statement on 13.3.1991 that she will not misbehave in future with the respondent or his mother and undertook not to file any complaints against him either to the police or to the higher authorities of the Board; that the matter was compromised and the petition for dissolution of the marriage was withdrawn. [3]. The respondent has further averred that soon after the above stated compromise, the appellant allegedly refused to honour her words and started making false and frivolous complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda alleging that she had fear for her life at the hands of the respondent. The respondent alleged that he along with the children has been forced to live in the small rented house and that he has a vast circle of friends but the appellant allegedly refused to look after the visitors and forced the respondent to cook meals, clean utensils and wash the clothes of the children also . This fact was allegedly noticed by the relatives and friends of the respondent who used to visit the house thereby causing great mental cruelty to him as the respondent's reputation stood blotted. It was further alleged that the appellant in connivance with her father broke open the locks of the house which is under the possession of his mother and valuable articles were removed.... . It was also alleged that -: 3 :- the appellant threatened the respondent to get him physically liquidated . On the strength of these allegations, the respondent sought dissolution of their marriage by a decree of divorce. [4]. The appellant contested the above stated petition vide her reply dated 16.12.1992 and took a preliminary objection that the respondent in fact was taking advantage of his own wrongs as it was he who subjected her to cruelty even though she wanted to lead a honorable life with him. The appellant specifically averred that the respondent has deserted her with ulterior motive and has declined to give food and shelter . On merits, the appellant took the plea that soon after their marriage, the respondent started harassing her for bringing insufficient dowry and did not even attend the marriage of her brother held in the year 1974. She alleged that till the time her father-in-law was alive, the respondent used to behave reasonably well, however, after his death in the year 1978, he started beating her mercilessly and on many occasions refused to provide food or woolen clothes during winters. It was alleged that for the last over five years, the respondent has been continuously beating her so badly and ruthlessly that it has also affected her eye sight. She denied the allegations that she refused to cook food for the respondent, their children or her mother-in-law or that she ever made any false complaints against the respondent to the authorities. In para of the written statement, the appellant specifically alleged that in fact the respondent desired to re-marry and wanted to get rid of her . She further alleged that the previous divorce petition was withdrawn by the respondent after stating that he had compromised the matter and shall not beat her and will behave properly in future. In fact the divorce petition was withdrawn by him to avoid maintenance pendente-lite and litigation expenses. The -: 4 :- appellant specifically averred that she never refused to accompany the respondent, rather it is he who refused to take the respondent to his home . She further averred that since the respondent wanted to turn her out of the matrimonial home, he himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813", "outcome": "allowed", "confidence": 0.85, "source": "rule-based", "reasoning": "Rule matches: {'allowed': ['allowed', 'allow', 'set aside', 'granted', 'set aside', 'set aside'], 'quashed': ['set aside'], 'dismissed': ['fails']}; selected 'allowed' with score 6.85."}

{"case_id": "appeal filed under Section 110-D of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, challenges the award dated 8.10.1987 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana ( for brevity `MACT'). The Tribunal has recorded findings that the claimant/appellants have not been able to prove the accident or the fact that the deceased Gurmukh Singh received injuries on account of rash and negligent driving of the bus by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. The Tribunal has further held that the claimant/appellants were the legal representatives of deceased Gurmukh Singh and that the income of deceased Gurmukh Singh was Rs.650/- per FAO No.161 of 1988 2 month and the dependency has been worked out at Rs.200/- per month. A multiplier of 15 has been applied. The father of the deceased claimant/appellant No.1 has been found to be 50 years of age and mother of the deceased claimant/appellant No.2 has been found to be 45 years of age. The other claimants were the brother and sister. However, only Daljit Kaur, minor, who was 16 years of age, has filed the appeal being claimant/appellant No.3. The deceased was 23 years of age at the time of his death and was post graduate. Accordingly a multiplier of 15 was applied and a total claim of Rs.36,000/- as compensation was calculated. However, on account of the fact that the claimant/appellants had failed to prove the accident, their claim application was dismissed. It would be appropriate to make a reference to the analysis of evidence undertaken by the tribunal to reach the conclusion that the accident did not take place on 11.2.1987 at :30 p.m. The same reads as under:- In support of this issue, the claimants have examined Mohinder Singh, PW1. He has stated that on 11.2.1987 at about 5:30 PM he was coming on a Luna Moped on Moga- Ludhiana road and when he was at some distance from Aarti Cinema Chowk towards Moga side the bus came from the side of Moga which was being driven at a very fast speed and at that time the deceased was also going on a Luna Moped from the side of Moga and he was crushed by the bus driver under the bus when he was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk to go to Gurdev Nagar. In his cross- examination, he has stated that he did not see the deceased Gurmukh Singh going in front of him and he saw him for the FAO No.161 of 1988 3 first time after the accident and that he reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes of the accident. He has further admitted that it is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on that side of the round about which faces Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana. The learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the accident stands proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as referred above. In reply to this argument, the learned counsel for the respondents have argued that no accident is proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as he has clearly admitted in his cross-examination that he reached the place of accident after about 10 or 15 minutes after the accident and the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped coming from the side of Jagraon. This argument seems to be correct. In case Mohinder Singh PW1 reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident, then it means that he did not witness the accident. No other witness has been examined by the claimants to prove the accident. The case of the claimants is that one Jagdish Lal also witnessed the accident, but he has not been examined by them for the reasons best known to them. The respondents have examined Kamikkar Singh driver, respondent No.4 in rebuttal as PW1. He has denied the allegations that the accident took place with his bus. Under these circumstances, there is no evidence on the file to prove that the accident took place with the bus which was FAO No.161 of 1988 4 being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver respondent No.4 and Gurmukh Singh received injuries in that accident. Thus, this issue remains un-proved and is decided against the claimants. During the pendency of the appeal, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants filed an application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC with the prayer to place on record a copy of the FIR No.30 dated 11.2.1987, registered at Police Station Civil Line Ludhiana, an hour after the accident. The accident had taken place at 5:30 p.m. and the FIR was lodged at 6:45 p.m. Vide a separate order passed today, the afore-mentioned application has been allowed as it was not brought on record before the Tribunal. Mr. Satinder Khanna, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants has argued that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in discarding the statement made by Mohinder Singh PW1 on the ground that he was not an eye witness as he reached the place of accident after 10-15 minutes is absolutely illegal. The version disclosed in the FIR would highlight that the deceased Gurmukh Singh was going in front of Mohinder Singh, the author of the FIR, on his Luna Moped bearing registration No.PJL 5057. Mohinder Singh was also following him on his own Luna No. PAL 9024. According to learned counsel, the statement made in the court was recorded after about 8 months and the detailed authentic version has been disclosed in the FIR lodged after about one hour. Learned counsel has emphasised that had the respondents desired, they could have confronted PW1 Mohinder Singh with this FIR where the version is different than the one disclosed in the statement made before the court. He has argued that once the driver of a vehicle is tried on account of rash and negligent driving it has to be prima-facie concluded that the accident was FAO No.161 of 1988 5 caused on account of rash and negligent driving, therefore, learned counsel has argued that the findings recorded by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 are liable to be reversed and it must be held that the accident has been caused on account of rash and negligent driving by Kamikkar Singh, driver- respondent No.4. Mr.S.K.Bhanot, learned State counsel has however, submitted that the tribunal has taken into account the statement made by the witness Mohinder Singh (PW1) admitting that he had reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes and that the place of accident was not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon. So he has submitted that the FIR cannot be taken into consideration unless it is proved either by its author or any other person. Therefore, it has been suggested that the FIR cannot be taken into account at this stage and the findings deserve to be upheld. Having heard learned counsel and perusing the record of the Tribunal, I am of the considered view that the findings recorded by the Tribunal cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. The Tribunal has stretched the statement of PW1 Mohinder Singh that he reached the place of accident -15 minutes later. The statement of Mohinder Singh PW1 infact no where suggests that he was not an eye witness to the accident. The relevant portions of the statement in chief and the cross-examination are as under:- On 11.2.87 at about 5:30 PM I was coming on the Moga Ludhiana road on a Luna Moped. When I was at some distance from Aarti Cinema towards Moga side, bus No.PJG 3108 came from the side of Moga. It was being driven at a very fast speed. Gurmukh Singh was also coming on a Luna Moped from the FAO No.161 of 1988 6 side of Moga. He was ahead of the bus. When Gurmukh Singh was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk the bus crushed him to death. The bus was being driven by Kamikkar Singh driver. The bus driver did not blow the horn. The bus was out of his control on account of the high speed. Gurmukh Singh was aged about 23 years. He died at the spot. One Jagdish Lal witnessed the accident. At about 8 PM the dead body of Gurmukh Singh was taken by us to Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, where it was subjected to post mortem examination.---------- The accident took place in that chowk when Gurmukh Singh was negotiating a turn on his right side to go to Gurdev Nagar. It is incorrect to suggest that there is a bus stop on the Ludhiana Moga road in between Aarti Cinema chowk and the Aarti cinema and all the buses coming from the side of Moga stop on that bus stop. It is correct that there is a rickshaw stand in between Arti Cinema and the chowk on the left side of the road while coming from Moga. Aarti Cinema chowk is a thickly populated area and there is great rush of vehicles on that part of the road. It is incorrect to suggest that Gurmukh Singh was struck down by a truck who ran away and the bus was wrongly involved while bus was stationary on the bus stop. It is also incorrect to suggest that I was not present at the place and time of accident.---------- I had not stated in my police statement that I and the deceased were going to that side in connection with the business of our FAO No.161 of 1988 7 shop. I did not see the deceased going in front of me. I saw him after the accident. I reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident. It is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on the side of the round about. The place of accident is that part of the round about of the chowk which faces Gurdev Nagar road. I saw him dead for the first time. Many persons had gathered there at the place of accident.---------- A perusal of the statement made by PW1 Mohinder Singh would show that the deceased was going on his Luna Moped ahead of the bus and not in front of the bus. He further stated that the deceased was taking turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk and at that time the bus crushed him to death which was being driven by driver-respondent No.4. He reiterated the statement when cross-examined by the learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 and denied the suggestion that Gurmukh Singh infact had struck against the truck which ran away, while the bus was stationary on the bus stop or that he was not present at the place and time of accident. During the cross-examination by driver-respondent No.4 the witness has stated that he did not see the deceased going in front of him, but there was no contradiction between the examination-in-chief and cross- examination. As such as in the examination-in-chief the witness had stated that the deceased was going ahead of the bus. The witness further stated that he saw the deceased after the accident and had reached the place of accident or 15 minutes after the accident. The afore mentioned statement made during cross-examination does not necessarily mean that the witness was FAO No.161 of 1988 8 giving an eye witness account. In fact, the witness was explaining the circumstantial evidence which lead to an inference that the deceased was killed in the accident on account of rash and negligent driving of bus by driver Kamikkar Singh, respondent No.4. The afore mentioned version finds support from the contents of the FIR recorded after about one hour. It shows that driver-respondent No.4, after hitting Gurmukh Singh, the deceased, stopped the bus at a distance and on coming to know about the death of Gurmukh Singh-deceased, he had run away. In these circumstances the statement made in the FIR if has been used for the purpose of contradiction can also be used for the purpose of corroboration. Such is the position of law under Section 162 of Criminal Procedure Code 1973. According to the proviso to Section 162(1) of Cr.P.C, if the statement made in the FIR is proved then the same may be used by the accused and with the permission of the Court by the prosecution to contradict a witness in the manner provided by Section 145 of Evidence Act, 1872 and that any part of the statement made in the FIR could also be used for corroboration. The principle incorporated by Section 162 Cr.P.C. would be applicable and the section itself ipso-facto may not apply. If that be so than the FIR and the statement made before the court read together would lead to only one conclusion that there were adequate circumstances supporting the inference that accident was caused by the offending bus which was being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Tribunal are liable to be set aside. Even otherwise this court has held in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham reported as 1993(2) PLR 109 that once a driver has been tried of an offence of rash and negligent driving, it is prima-facie safe to conclude that FAO No.161 of 1988 9 the accident had occurred on that account.

{"case_id": "Criminal Revision was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation to impugn the judgment dated 27.2.1996 rendered by Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur. Complaint under Section 85(g) of the Employees' State Insurance Act, 1948 ( hereinafter referred to as the Act ) was instituted by Employees State Insurance Corporation through its Insurance Inspector/ Manager, Local Office, Dhariwal, on the allegations that accused Rakesh Kumar Ohri (Proprietor) was and continued to be the Principal Employer of M/S. Raman & Company (Rice Mill), Awankhe Gate, near D.A.V.School, Dina Nagar in terms of Section 2(17) of the Act and at the time of committing of offence was in-charge and was responsible to the establishment for the superannuating of control of the business of the establishment. The accused has failed to produce the record, namely, wages/salaries registers, contribution registers, return of contributions, registers of employees' under Regulation 32 and other record pertaining to the payment of contributions, Inspection book, payment vouchers and ledgers and cash books for inspection before Insurance Inspector on 10.8.1993 and 22.9.1993 for the period from 1.7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Due to non- production of the record as mentioned above, accused has committed an offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Accused was summoned to face trial. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued. Accused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Accused moved an application dated 11.2.1995 for dropping the proceedings on the allegation that complaint was instituted after the expiry of period of limitation, as per Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. Notice was issued to the complainant. Ultimately, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, opined that complaint is not maintainable being time barred and was dismissed. Feeling dissatisfied with the order dated 27.2.1996 this revision petition was instituted. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. Learned counsel for the revisionist argued that main complaint was presented on 10.11.1993. After summoning, accused had appeared on 23.11.1994. Notice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued on 5.1.1995. Under the Act, no limitation is provided. Maximum sentence under Section 85(g) of the Act is two years and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-. Contribution is every month. Due to non-deposit of contribution offence under Sectilon 85(g) is a continuing offence. Learned counsel for the revisionist cited ESIC Vs. C.C.Santhakumar, JT 2006(10) SC 549. Learned counsel for the respondent argued that as per Section 468 Cr.P.C. complaint was not within limitation. Court has no power to take cognizance beyond the expiry of limitation. Due to non-production of record, complaint should have been filed within six months. As per the Act, question of limitation can be agitated at any stage even after cognizance is taken. In the present case, cognizance was taken on 5.1.1995 when notice was issued. As per allegation of the revisionist, respondent failed to produce record pertaining to the payment of contributions, inspection book, payment vouchers, ledgers and cash book etc for investigation for the period from .7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required under Section 45 of the Act. Complaint was presented in the Court of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur on .11.1993. Notice was issued to the accused to appear in the Court. After appearance of the accused, on 23.11.1994, notice under Section 85(g) was issued on 5.1.1995. Record is silent as to on which date application for dropping proceedings under Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. were presented. Due to non-production of record, accused are liable for the commission of offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the Act. Section 85(g) of the Act is reproduced as under:- (g) is guilty of any contravention of or non- compliance with any of the requirements of this Act or the rules or the regulations in respect of which no special penalty is provided. ( he shall be punishable (i) where the commits an offence under clause (a), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years but- (a) which shall not be less than one year, in case of failure to pay the employee s contribution which has been deducted by him from the employee s wages and shall also be liable to fine of ten thousand rupees; (b) which shall not be less than six months, in any other case and shall also be liable to fine of five thousand rupees. Provided that the Court may, or any adequate and special reason to be recorded in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a lesser term. (ii) where he commits an offence under any of the clauses (b) to (g) (both inclusive), with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to four thousand rupees, or with both.) In E.S.I.C. v. C.C. Santhakumar, JT 2006 (10) SC , the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as under:- 21. It is clear, therefore, that the right of the Corporation to recover these amounts by coercive process is not restricted by any limitation nor could be the Government by recourse to the rule-making power prescribed a period in the teeth of Section 68. . In the above judgment this Court has clearly held that Section 68 of the Act empowers the Corporation to resort to coercive process, to recover the contribution from the employer as if it were an arrear of land revenue and the said right is not restricted by any limitation. This is a crucial Section. . Similarly, no limitation is provided in Chapter VII. It deals with the imposition of penalty or levy of damages upon failure to pay contributions. It consists of Sections 84 to 86A. . When the Act itself does not provide for any limitation on the Corporation right to claim, the employers cannot rely upon Regulations 32 to , dealing with the period for maintenance of registers, to imply any limitation. Gurdeep Singh Vs. State and others, (3) 289 was relied by the learned trial Court for disposing of the application for dropping proceedings wherein it was held that: A. Delhi Police Act, 1978, Sections 93 and and 2 ( r)- Altercation took place inside the house No offence under Section 93 made out- Offence under Section 93 is made out if accused used any street or public place for threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intend to provoke breach of peace.

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA Present: Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate for the appellant. Ms. Hemlata Balhara, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana for the State. KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. Taqdir Singh son of Lehri Singh has preferred the present appeal and has challenged the judgment of conviction and order of sentence dated 30th July, 1998, whereby he was held guilty of offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC. The trial Court had sentenced the appellant under Section 452 IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant was further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of seven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1 years under Section 376 IPC. ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 of Police Station Sahlawas was present at Jhajjar, when the prosecutrix PW-1 (whose name has been withheld to protect her identity) along with her husband Nahnu Ram PW-5 appeared and made statement Ex.PA, on the basis of which FIR No.32 dated .05.1996 was registered at Police Station Sahlawas. The prosecutrix stated that her parents belong to Dadri Toe. About 11 months before the occurrence, she was married with Nahnu Ram. She was staying in her matrimonial home at village Chandol. She had set up a separate residence with her husband three months before the occurrence and her in-laws were residing in another house. On 3rd May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m. her husband had gone to village Bhakli to do the work of Halwai (sweet maker) in a marriage and she was alone at her house. At about .00 p.m., she went to sleep in the courtyard after bolting the door of her house. She had retired to her bed after taking her meals. At about 11.00 p.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time, the present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had gagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear only. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her mouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied both of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in both the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were broken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide resistance. The accused had broken the string of Salwar of the prosecutrix, removed her panty and forcibly committed sexual intercourse upon her. After the occurrence, the accused untied the hands of the prosecutrix, removed the cloth from her face and ran away from the spot. In the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in- law Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was sent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm to her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house, since the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of the people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant along with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police.

{"case_id": "writ petitions in the High Court claiming revised scales of pay on the ground that they had taken graduate degrees and, therefore, were entitled to the benefit of the grade mentioned against Category `A' in the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957. In opposition to the writ petitions, the State Government contended that the letter did not contemplate the grant of the grade to all teachers but only to teachers appointed as Masters. The High Court held the teachers entitled to the benefit of the revised grade, whether or not they had been appointed as Masters, because, in the opinion of the High Court, the qualifying criterion was the possession of a graduate degree. The judgment of the High Court was affirmed by this Court in Kirpal Singh Bhatia (AIR 1976 SC 2459) (supra). The State Government found it difficult, having regard to the prevailing burden on its financial resources, to extend the benefit of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 to the much wider section of teachers covered in consequence of the Court's judgment.

{"case_id": "Appeal has been filed by the wife against the judgment dated 3.6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhatinda whereby a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act (for short the Act) on the ground of cruelty and desertion, preferred by the respondent husband, has been accepted and their marriage has been dissolved by a decree of divorce. [2]. The marriage between the parties was solemnized on 19.2.1973 at Patiala. At the time when the subject divorce petition was filed by the husband on 21.10.1991, they had three male children born out of the wedlock and they were about 18, 16 and 12 years of age respectively. In his -: 2 :- petition, the respondent alleged that the behaviour of the appellant towards the respondent and his old mother was indifferent from the very beginning; that she is suffering from some sort of mental disorder with the result that she refused to cook meals for him and the minor children; that she levelled false allegations qua the character of the respondent; that she gave severe beatings to the mother of the respondent on 22.9.1990 and that as a result thereof, he filed a divorce petition in which the appellant allegedly made a statement on 13.3.1991 that she will not misbehave in future with the respondent or his mother and undertook not to file any complaints against him either to the police or to the higher authorities of the Board; that the matter was compromised and the petition for dissolution of the marriage was withdrawn. [3]. The respondent has further averred that soon after the above stated compromise, the appellant allegedly refused to honour her words and started making false and frivolous complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda alleging that she had fear for her life at the hands of the respondent. The respondent alleged that he along with the children has been forced to live in the small rented house and that he has a vast circle of friends but the appellant allegedly refused to look after the visitors and forced the respondent to cook meals, clean utensils and wash the clothes of the children also . This fact was allegedly noticed by the relatives and friends of the respondent who used to visit the house thereby causing great mental cruelty to him as the respondent's reputation stood blotted. It was further alleged that the appellant in connivance with her father broke open the locks of the house which is under the possession of his mother and valuable articles were removed.... . It was also alleged that -: 3 :- the appellant threatened the respondent to get him physically liquidated . On the strength of these allegations, the respondent sought dissolution of their marriage by a decree of divorce. [4]. The appellant contested the above stated petition vide her reply dated 16.12.1992 and took a preliminary objection that the respondent in fact was taking advantage of his own wrongs as it was he who subjected her to cruelty even though she wanted to lead a honorable life with him. The appellant specifically averred that the respondent has deserted her with ulterior motive and has declined to give food and shelter . On merits, the appellant took the plea that soon after their marriage, the respondent started harassing her for bringing insufficient dowry and did not even attend the marriage of her brother held in the year 1974. She alleged that till the time her father-in-law was alive, the respondent used to behave reasonably well, however, after his death in the year 1978, he started beating her mercilessly and on many occasions refused to provide food or woolen clothes during winters. It was alleged that for the last over five years, the respondent has been continuously beating her so badly and ruthlessly that it has also affected her eye sight. She denied the allegations that she refused to cook food for the respondent, their children or her mother-in-law or that she ever made any false complaints against the respondent to the authorities. In para of the written statement, the appellant specifically alleged that in fact the respondent desired to re-marry and wanted to get rid of her . She further alleged that the previous divorce petition was withdrawn by the respondent after stating that he had compromised the matter and shall not beat her and will behave properly in future. In fact the divorce petition was withdrawn by him to avoid maintenance pendente-lite and litigation expenses. The -: 4 :- appellant specifically averred that she never refused to accompany the respondent, rather it is he who refused to take the respondent to his home .

{"case_id": "appeal filed under Section 110-D of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939, challenges the award dated 8.10.1987 passed by the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana ( for brevity `MACT'). The Tribunal has recorded findings that the claimant/appellants have not been able to prove the accident or the fact that the deceased Gurmukh Singh received injuries on account of rash and negligent driving of the bus by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. The Tribunal has further held that the claimant/appellants were the legal representatives of deceased Gurmukh Singh and that the income of deceased Gurmukh Singh was Rs.650/- per FAO No.161 of 1988 2 month and the dependency has been worked out at Rs.200/- per month. A multiplier of 15 has been applied. The father of the deceased claimant/appellant No.1 has been found to be 50 years of age and mother of the deceased claimant/appellant No.2 has been found to be 45 years of age. The other claimants were the brother and sister. However, only Daljit Kaur, minor, who was 16 years of age, has filed the appeal being claimant/appellant No.3. The deceased was 23 years of age at the time of his death and was post graduate. Accordingly a multiplier of 15 was applied and a total claim of Rs.36,000/- as compensation was calculated. However, on account of the fact that the claimant/appellants had failed to prove the accident, their claim application was dismissed. It would be appropriate to make a reference to the analysis of evidence undertaken by the tribunal to reach the conclusion that the accident did not take place on 11.2.1987 at :30 p.m. The same reads as under:- In support of this issue, the claimants have examined Mohinder Singh, PW1. He has stated that on 11.2.1987 at about 5:30 PM he was coming on a Luna Moped on Moga- Ludhiana road and when he was at some distance from Aarti Cinema Chowk towards Moga side the bus came from the side of Moga which was being driven at a very fast speed and at that time the deceased was also going on a Luna Moped from the side of Moga and he was crushed by the bus driver under the bus when he was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk to go to Gurdev Nagar. In his cross- examination, he has stated that he did not see the deceased Gurmukh Singh going in front of him and he saw him for the FAO No.161 of 1988 3 first time after the accident and that he reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes of the accident. He has further admitted that it is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on that side of the round about which faces Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana. The learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the accident stands proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as referred above. In reply to this argument, the learned counsel for the respondents have argued that no accident is proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as he has clearly admitted in his cross-examination that he reached the place of accident after about 10 or 15 minutes after the accident and the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped coming from the side of Jagraon. This argument seems to be correct. In case Mohinder Singh PW1 reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident, then it means that he did not witness the accident. No other witness has been examined by the claimants to prove the accident. The case of the claimants is that one Jagdish Lal also witnessed the accident, but he has not been examined by them for the reasons best known to them. The respondents have examined Kamikkar Singh driver, respondent No.4 in rebuttal as PW1. He has denied the allegations that the accident took place with his bus. Under these circumstances, there is no evidence on the file to prove that the accident took place with the bus which was FAO No.161 of 1988 4 being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver respondent No.4 and Gurmukh Singh received injuries in that accident. Thus, this issue remains un-proved and is decided against the claimants. During the pendency of the appeal, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants filed an application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC with the prayer to place on record a copy of the FIR No.30 dated 11.2.1987, registered at Police Station Civil Line Ludhiana, an hour after the accident. The accident had taken place at 5:30 p.m. and the FIR was lodged at 6:45 p.m. Vide a separate order passed today, the afore-mentioned application has been allowed as it was not brought on record before the Tribunal. Mr. Satinder Khanna, learned counsel for the claimant/appellants has argued that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in discarding the statement made by Mohinder Singh PW1 on the ground that he was not an eye witness as he reached the place of accident after 10-15 minutes is absolutely illegal. The version disclosed in the FIR would highlight that the deceased Gurmukh Singh was going in front of Mohinder Singh, the author of the FIR, on his Luna Moped bearing registration No.PJL 5057. Mohinder Singh was also following him on his own Luna No. PAL 9024. According to learned counsel, the statement made in the court was recorded after about 8 months and the detailed authentic version has been disclosed in the FIR lodged after about one hour. Learned counsel has emphasised that had the respondents desired, they could have confronted PW1 Mohinder Singh with this FIR where the version is different than the one disclosed in the statement made before the court. He has argued that once the driver of a vehicle is tried on account of rash and negligent driving it has to be prima-facie concluded that the accident was FAO No.161 of 1988 5 caused on account of rash and negligent driving, therefore, learned counsel has argued that the findings recorded by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 are liable to be reversed and it must be held that the accident has been caused on account of rash and negligent driving by Kamikkar Singh, driver- respondent No.4. Mr.S.K.Bhanot, learned State counsel has however, submitted that the tribunal has taken into account the statement made by the witness Mohinder Singh (PW1) admitting that he had reached the place of accident after 10 or 15 minutes and that the place of accident was not visible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon. So he has submitted that the FIR cannot be taken into consideration unless it is proved either by its author or any other person. Therefore, it has been suggested that the FIR cannot be taken into account at this stage and the findings deserve to be upheld. Having heard learned counsel and perusing the record of the Tribunal, I am of the considered view that the findings recorded by the Tribunal cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. The Tribunal has stretched the statement of PW1 Mohinder Singh that he reached the place of accident -15 minutes later. The statement of Mohinder Singh PW1 infact no where suggests that he was not an eye witness to the accident. The relevant portions of the statement in chief and the cross-examination are as under:- On 11.2.87 at about 5:30 PM I was coming on the Moga Ludhiana road on a Luna Moped. When I was at some distance from Aarti Cinema towards Moga side, bus No.PJG 3108 came from the side of Moga. It was being driven at a very fast speed. Gurmukh Singh was also coming on a Luna Moped from the FAO No.161 of 1988 6 side of Moga. He was ahead of the bus. When Gurmukh Singh was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk the bus crushed him to death. The bus was being driven by Kamikkar Singh driver. The bus driver did not blow the horn. The bus was out of his control on account of the high speed. Gurmukh Singh was aged about 23 years. He died at the spot. One Jagdish Lal witnessed the accident. At about 8 PM the dead body of Gurmukh Singh was taken by us to Civil Hospital, Ludhiana, where it was subjected to post mortem examination.---------- The accident took place in that chowk when Gurmukh Singh was negotiating a turn on his right side to go to Gurdev Nagar. It is incorrect to suggest that there is a bus stop on the Ludhiana Moga road in between Aarti Cinema chowk and the Aarti cinema and all the buses coming from the side of Moga stop on that bus stop. It is correct that there is a rickshaw stand in between Arti Cinema and the chowk on the left side of the road while coming from Moga. Aarti Cinema chowk is a thickly populated area and there is great rush of vehicles on that part of the road. It is incorrect to suggest that Gurmukh Singh was struck down by a truck who ran away and the bus was wrongly involved while bus was stationary on the bus stop. It is also incorrect to suggest that I was not present at the place and time of accident.---------- I had not stated in my police statement that I and the deceased were going to that side in connection with the business of our FAO No.161 of 1988 7 shop. I did not see the deceased going in front of me. I saw him after the accident. I reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident. It is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on the side of the round about. The place of accident is that part of the round about of the chowk which faces Gurdev Nagar road. I saw him dead for the first time. Many persons had gathered there at the place of accident.---------- A perusal of the statement made by PW1 Mohinder Singh would show that the deceased was going on his Luna Moped ahead of the bus and not in front of the bus. He further stated that the deceased was taking turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk and at that time the bus crushed him to death which was being driven by driver-respondent No.4. He reiterated the statement when cross-examined by the learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 and denied the suggestion that Gurmukh Singh infact had struck against the truck which ran away, while the bus was stationary on the bus stop or that he was not present at the place and time of accident. During the cross-examination by driver-respondent No.4 the witness has stated that he did not see the deceased going in front of him, but there was no contradiction between the examination-in-chief and cross- examination. As such as in the examination-in-chief the witness had stated that the deceased was going ahead of the bus. The witness further stated that he saw the deceased after the accident and had reached the place of accident or 15 minutes after the accident. The afore mentioned statement made during cross-examination does not necessarily mean that the witness was FAO No.161 of 1988 8 giving an eye witness account. In fact, the witness was explaining the circumstantial evidence which lead to an inference that the deceased was killed in the accident on account of rash and negligent driving of bus by driver Kamikkar Singh, respondent No.4. The afore mentioned version finds support from the contents of the FIR recorded after about one hour. It shows that driver-respondent No.4, after hitting Gurmukh Singh, the deceased, stopped the bus at a distance and on coming to know about the death of Gurmukh Singh-deceased, he had run away. In these circumstances the statement made in the FIR if has been used for the purpose of contradiction can also be used for the purpose of corroboration. Such is the position of law under Section 162 of Criminal Procedure Code 1973. According to the proviso to Section 162(1) of Cr.P.C, if the statement made in the FIR is proved then the same may be used by the accused and with the permission of the Court by the prosecution to contradict a witness in the manner provided by Section 145 of Evidence Act, 1872 and that any part of the statement made in the FIR could also be used for corroboration. The principle incorporated by Section 162 Cr.P.C. would be applicable and the section itself ipso-facto may not apply. If that be so than the FIR and the statement made before the court read together would lead to only one conclusion that there were adequate circumstances supporting the inference that accident was caused by the offending bus which was being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Tribunal are liable to be set aside. Even otherwise this court has held in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham reported as 1993(2) PLR 109 that once a driver has been tried of an offence of rash and negligent driving, it is prima-facie safe to conclude that FAO No.161 of 1988 9 the accident had occurred on that account.
