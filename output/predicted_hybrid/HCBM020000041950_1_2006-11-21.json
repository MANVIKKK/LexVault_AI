At present an amount of Rs.16,759.24 is lying to the credit of the estate as against the proved liability of Rs.7,33,070/-. Since no further recoveries are possible and since no other proved creditor has come forward before the Official Assignee, the Official Assignee has prayed that the balance of Rs.16,759.24 may be transferred to the unclaimed dividend capital account under Rule 178 of the Bombay Insolvency Rules, 1910 and thereafter to the unclaimed dividend capital revenue account and the account may be closed for the administrative purposes.
