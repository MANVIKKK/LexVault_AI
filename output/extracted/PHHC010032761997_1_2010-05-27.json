  "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA \nAT CHANDIGARH\nCriminal Revision No.251 of 1997\nDate of Decision : May 27, 2010\nMadan Lal\n ....Petitioner\nVersus\nState (Chandigarh Administration)\n .....Respondent\nCORAM :\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE T.P.S. MANN\nPresent :\nMr. D.S. Malwai, Advocate as\nAmicus Curiae for the petitioner. \nMr. Rajiv Sharma, Advocate \nfor Union Territory, Chandigarh. \nT.P.S. MANN, J. (Oral)\nThe petitioner was tried for the offence punishable under\nSection 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food\nAdulteration Act on the allegations that on 13.6.1990, he was found in\npossession of about 500 bottles of sweetened carbonated water (orange)\nfor sale in village Darua and the sample drawn therefrom was found to\ncontain brominated vegetable oil, use of which was not permitted. Vide\njudgment and order dated 13.9.1994, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nChandigarh convicted the petitioner for the aforementioned offence and\nsentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to\npay a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo\nfurther rigorous imprisonment for one month. The amount of fine was\npaid. \nAggrieved of his conviction and sentence, the petitioner filed\nCriminal Revision No.251 of 1997\n -2-\nan appeal but the same was dismissed by learned Additional Sessions\nJudge, Chandigarh on 1.3.1997 by maintaining his conviction and\nsentence. \nLearned counsel for the petitioner has not challenged the\nconviction of the petitioner. However, he has submitted that the sample\nwas drawn from the petitioner on 13.6.1990. After receipt of the report\nfrom the Chemical Examiner, the criminal proceedings were initiated\nagainst the petitioner in the month of October, 1990 when a criminal\ncomplaint was filed by the Food Inspector. Ever since then, the petitioner\nhas been facing the agony of criminal prosecution. The present revision\nhas remained pending in this Court for the last more than 13 years.\nConsequent upon the dismissal of his appeal by the lower appellate\nCourt, the petitioner was taken into custody on 1.3.1997 and it was only\non 18.3.1997 that he was granted the concession of bail during the\npendency of his revision. Therefore, the substantive sentence of the\npetitioner be reduced to that already undergone by him. \nLearned counsel representing the Union Territory of\nChandigarh has opposed the prayer made on behalf of the petitioner by\nsubmitting that as the sweetened carbonated water (orange) sold by the\npetitioner was found adulterated, therefore, the petitioner has rightly been\nsentenced to minimum imprisonment and fine and the same cannot be\nreduced. \nIn Parshadi V State of Haryana 2004(2) R.C.R. (Criminal)\n, the sentence of a similarly situated accused, who stood convicted\nunder Section 7 read with Section 16(1)(a)(i) of the Act was reduced to\nCriminal Revision No.251 of 1997\n -3-\nthat already undergone by him as he had been facing the trial for a period\nof fourteen years. However, his fine was enhanced. While doing so, the\nCourt relied upon a number of judgments, viz, Mahavir V. State through\nGovt. Food Inspector, 2000(4) RCR(Crl.) 208, Behari Lal V. State of\n(U.T.) Chandigarh, 2000(1) RCR(Crl.) 222, Des Raj V. The State of\nHaryana, 1996(1) RCR 689, Vijay Kumar V. The State of Haryana 1996\n(2) RCR(Crl.) 554 (P&H), Mohinder Singh V. State (Chandigarh\nAdministration), 1997(2) RCR(Crl.) 168 (P&H) and Satpal V. State of\nHaryana, 1997(4) RCR(Crl.) 15 (P&H).\nIn Narinder Kumar V. State of Haryana 2008(2) All India\nCriminal Law Reporter 288, this Court, once again, reduced the sentence\nof a similarly situated convict to that already undergone by him as the\noccurrence pertained to the year 1984. \nIt is a fact that the sword of criminal prosecution has\nremained hanging on the head of the petitioner for the last more than 20\nyears. The present revision has remained pending in this Court for more\nthan 13 years. Out of the sentence of six months imposed upon him, the\npetitioner has already undergone a period of three weeks. When the\npetitioner was heard by the trial Court on the quantum of sentence, he\nhad pleaded that he was a young person of 27 years of age and had a\nlong way to go. There is no material on the file that the petitioner is a\nprevious convict or that he is involved in any other crime. Keeping in view\nthe observations made by different High Courts in the aforementioned\njudgments, I am of the view that no useful purpose would be served by\nsending the petitioner behind the bars, once again, so as to undergo\nCriminal Revision No.251 of 1997\n -4-\nremainder of his sentence. Ends of justice would be amply met if the\nsubstantive sentence of the petitioner is reduced to that already\nundergone by him and at the same time enhancing the fine of Rs.1,000/-\nto Rs.10,000/-.\nResultantly, the conviction of the petitioner for the offence\nunder Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food\nAdulteration Act is maintained. His substantive sentence of imprisonment\nis reduced to that already undergone by him. The fine of Rs.1,000/- is\nenhanced to Rs.10,000/-. The enhanced amount of fine be deposited by\nthe petitioner with the trial Court within three months from today, failing\nwhich he shall be required to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three\nmonths.\nThe revision is, accordingly, disposed of.\n ( T.P.S.MANN )\nMay 27, 2010\n JUDGE\nsatish"
