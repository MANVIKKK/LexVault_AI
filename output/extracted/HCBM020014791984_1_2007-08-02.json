In paragraph six of this order the\nlearned Single Judge observed thus : \n A   perusal   of   the   report   of   the  \nOfficial Liquidator dated 19th April,\nwould ex facie demonstrate that\nthe Liquidator has not dealt with  \nthe claim of the Customs Authorities\nto   priority.   The   report   considers  \nonly the question of apportionment.\nIn fact in paragraphs 15 and 16 of \nthe affidavit filed by the Customs  \nDepartment   before   the   Official\n\nLiquidator, a claim of priority has \nbeen   raised.     Though   there   was  \ninadvertance   on   the   part   of   the  \nCustoms Authorities in not pointing \nout the subsequent directions of the\nDivision Bench dated 19th  December,  \nand 9th  January, 2004 when an  \norder was passed by the Court on 22nd\nMarch,   2007,   it   is   necessary   and  \nproper that in compliance with the  \ndirections   of   the   Division   Bench,  \nthe question of priority is \nconsidered   afresh.     In   order   to  \nfacilitate this parties shall appear\nbefore the Official Liquidator on 3rd\nMay, 2007 through authorised \nrepresentatives and/or Advocates at \n.00 a.m. when the Customs \nAuthorities shall be at liberty to  \nplace   all   their   submissions   in  \nregard to the claim of priority and \napportionment.     The   Warehousing  \nCorporations   would   also   be   at\n\nliberty to place their submissions  \non the record. The Liquidator shall\nafter considering the rival \nsubmissions place a further report  \nafter adjudicating upon the claim,  \nincluding the question of \npriority. \n.\nLearned   counsel   appearing   for   the   Central\nWarehousing Corporation and the Customs Department\nsubmitted   that   directions   sought   in   the   Report\ncannot be granted. They submitted that in view of\nthe   aforesaid   directions   given   by   the   learned\nSingle Judge vide order dated 21st April, 2007, the\nOfficial   Liquidator   ought   to   have   made   the   legal\nopinion   given   by   M/s.Billawala   &   Co   available   to\nthe Central Warehousing Corporation & the Customs\nDepartment and conducted a fresh hearing and only\nafter adjudicating upon the claim he should filed\nReport   before   this   Court.     Upon   perusal   of   the\ndirections given by this Court in the order dated\nst  April, 2007 and the prayer clause (a) in the\nReport I find substance in the submissions advanced\nby   learned   counsel.     After   obtaining   the   legal\nopinion, admittedly no hearing was conducted by the\nOfficial   Liquidator.     In   the   circumstances,   I   am\nsatisfied   this   Report   can   be   disposed   of   by   the\nfollowing directions : \n(a)\nThe legal opinion given by M/s.Billawala &\nCo.   be   made   available   to   the   learned   counsel\nappearing   for   the   Central   Warehousing   Corporation\nand   the   Customs   Department.  \n  The   Official\nLiquidator   to   fix   a   date   of   hearing   afresh   and\nafter considering the rival submissions place fresh\nreport after adjudicating upon the claim, including\na question of priority.\n(b)\nWith   these   directions,   the   Official\nLiquidator's   Report   stands   disposed   of.     It   is\nneedless   to   express   that   the   Official   Liquidator\nshall   give   written   intimation   to   the   advocates\nappearing   on   behalf   of   the   Central   Warehousing\nCorporation,   the   Maharashtra   State   Warehousing\nCorporation   and   the   Customs   Department   well   in\nadvance.\n (D.B.BHOSALE, J.)"
