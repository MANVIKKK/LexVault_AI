  "judgment_text": "In the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh\n R. F. A No. 906 of 1992 (O&M)\nThe State of Haryana and another \n..... Appellants\nvs\nBir Singh and others \n..... Respondents\nCoram:\nHon'ble Mr. Justice Rajesh Bindal\nPresent: \nMr. Ashish Gupta, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana. \nMr. Manoj Sharma, Advocate for \nMr. C. B. Goel, Advocate, for the respondents. \nRajesh Bindal J.\nThe State has filed the present appeal against the award of the\nlearned court below passed under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894\n(for short, 'the Act') seeking reduction in the compensation for the acquired land. \nBriefly, the facts of the case are that the State of Haryana vide\nnotification dated 10.1.1983 issued under Section 4 of the Act, acquired the land\nsituated in revenue estate of Village Jharsa, Tehsil and District Gurgaon, for the\ndevelopment and utilisation thereof for residential and commercial purpose at\nGurgaon. The Land Acquisition Collector assessed the market value of different\nkinds of land at different rates. On reference under Section 18 of the Act, the\nlearned court below determined the market value of the acquired land which is\nsituated in the rear portion to the National Highway at ` 68/- per square yard and\nfor the land which is within the depth of ten yards from National Highway at `\n/- per square yard.\nLearned State counsel very fairly conceded that the claim made in\nthe appeal is squarely covered against the State by judgment of this court in RFA\nNo. 2868 of 1992- Balai Ram and others vs State of Haryana and another,\ndecided on 19.11.2008, whereby award of the Reference Court was upheld.\nAccordingly, the claim made in the present appeal does not survive. \nFor the reasons recorded in Balai Ram's case (supra), the present\nappeal is dismissed. \n.7.2010.\n ( Rajesh Bindal)\nvs.\n\n Judge"
