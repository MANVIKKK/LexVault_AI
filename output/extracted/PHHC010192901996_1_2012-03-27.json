JUSTICE ALOK SINGH\nPresent:\nMs. Savita Saxena, Advocate,\nfor the applicant-revenue.\nMr. Alok Mittal, Advocate,\nfor the respondent-assessee(s).\n.\nTo be referred to the Reporters or not?\n.\nWhether the Judgment should be reported in the\nDigest\nM.M. KUMAR, J.\n.\nThis order shall dispose of I.T.R. Nos. 17, 18 and 22 of\n. These references have emerged from identical orders dated\n.11.1994, passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,\nChandigarh Bench (for brevity,  the Tribunal ) in ITA Nos.\n/Chandi/1989; 1076/Chandi/1989; and 1042/Chandi/1989, in\nITR Nos. 17, 18 and 22 of 1996\nrespect of Assessment Year 1982-83 in the cases of the respondent-\nassessee(s). At the instance of the revenue, the Tribunal has\nreferred identical question of law for the opinion of this Court by\nexercising jurisdiction under Section 256(1) of the Income-tax Act,\n(for brevity,  the Act ). The question of law framed in ITR No.\nof 1996 reads as under:-\n Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the\ncase, the Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that the\nshare income attributable to 40% of the assessee s right,\ntitle and interest of her share income in M/s Munjal Gases\nwas to be excluded from the assessee s total income? \n.\nAt the outset, learned counsel for the revenue has fairly\nstated that the above mentioned question of law has already been\nanswered by this Court against the revenue and in favour of the\nassessee in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (Central)\nLudhiana v. Pawan Kant (ITR No. 7 of 1989, Assessment Year 1981-\n, decided on 30.8.2004). In Pawan Kant s case (supra) the\nDivision Bench in turn noticed that the question of law, in fact,\nstands already decided by this Court in the case of Commissioner of\nIncome Tax v. Bhagat Singh, (1998) 229 ITR 239, wherein it has\nbeen held that the assets received by an assessee on partition and\naccretion thereto upto the date of marriage of the assessee did not\ncease to be HUF property and the income of such property was\nassessable in the hands of the HUF constituted by him with his\ndaughter. The plea of the revenue that there must be atleast two\nmale members to form a HUF as taxable entity was specifically\nrejected. Following the said judgment and agreeing with the view\nITR Nos. 17, 18 and 22 of 1996\ntaken by the Tribunal, the Division Bench in Pawan Kant s case\n(supra) has summed up as under:\n \nRespectfully following the aforesaid judgment, we\nare of the view that the Tribunal was right in holding that\nthe property received by the assessee on partition of the\nHUF continues to be joint family property in his hands\nand the income therefrom after his marriage was\nassessable in the hands of the HUF constituted by him\nwith his wife. Similar view has also been expressed by a\nFull Bench of the Patna High Court in Commissioner of\nIncome-Tax v. Shankar Lal Budhia, (1987) 165 I.T.R. 380\nand by the Full Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court\nin Commissioner of Income-Tax, M.P. 1 v. Krishan Kumar,\n(1983) 143 I.T.R. 462. Accordingly, the question is\nanswered in the affirmative i.e. in favour of the assessee\nand against the revenue. \n.\nRespectfully following the opinion expressed by the\nDivision Bench of this Court in the case of Pawan Kant (supra), the\nreferred question is decided against the revenue and in favour of\nthe assessee(s).\n.\nThe references are disposed of.\n.\nA photocopy of this order be placed on the files of\nconnected cases.\n(M.M.
