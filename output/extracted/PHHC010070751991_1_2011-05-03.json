KANNAN J (Oral)\nCWP Nos.12508 of 1990 addresses the issue of defence\nentered by private individuals against the panchayat contending that the\ncivil court had earlier upheld the claim for declaration and granted decree\nof injunction. In CWP No.12508 of 1990, the Collector had upheld\nobjections and dismissed the petition but appellate authority rejected the\ncontention and directed eviction without expressly stating as to how the\npanchayat could ignore the civil court's decree and seek their eviction. The\norder is untenable and is required to be quashed. The writ petition is\nallowed. \n.5.2011\n( K. KANNAN )\nGS\n JUDGE"
