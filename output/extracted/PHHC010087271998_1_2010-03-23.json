  "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA\nAT CHANDIGARH\nCriminal Appeal No. 697-SB of 1998\nDate of decision: 23rd March, 2010\nVidya Parshad Tiwari\n   Appellant \nVersus \nState of Haryana \n  Respondent\nCORAM: \nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA\nPresent:\nMr. Harbhagwan Singh, Senior Advocate with \nMr. Amit Kumar, Advocate for the appellant. \nMr. Manish Deswal, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana\nfor the State. \nKANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. \nPresent appeal has been filed by Vidya Parshad Tiwari son of\nRam Saran Tiwari. He was named as an accused in case FIR No.729\ndated 14.06.1997 registered at Police Station Central Faridabad under\nSection 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to\nas,  the Act ). The appellant has been convicted by the Court of Special\nJudge, Faridabad. \nThe appellant was a Depot holder for supplying sugar and\nkerosene as ration to the beneficiaries under the Public Distribution\nSystem. The trial Court came to the conclusion that the accused had failed\nto maintain the account books properly regarding the months of May and\nJune, 1997. He failed to account for 4 quintals 42 kilograms and 50 grams\nof sugar and 1005 liters of kerosene pertaining to the quota for the month\nof May, 1997. The appellant also failed to account for 900 liters of\nkerosene out of the allotted quota for the month of June, 1997. The\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nappellant had not maintained the sales and stock registers in consonance\nwith the provisions of Clause-9 of the Haryana Prevention of Hoarding and\nMaintenance of Quality Order, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as,  the Quality\nOrder ). Furthermore, it was held that the sale register of sugar for the\nmonth of May 1997 contained various blank entries against which\nsignatures of the consumers were appended and thus, he had also\nviolated Clause-6 of the Quality Order. For these violations, the appellant\nwas held guilty of offence under Section 7 of the Act. Having held the\nappellant guilty, he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a\nperiod of one year and to pay a fine of Rs.5000/-, in default of payment of\nfine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months. It has\nbeen submitted that the appellant had deposited the fine. \nIn the present case, FIR was registered on the basis of a\nwritten communication sent by J.B. Gondia, District Food and Supplies\nController, Faridabad. It was stated in the FIR that the complainant along\nwith his staff on 13th June, 1997 had conducted the inspection of the\npremises of Vidya Parshad Tiwari, Depot holder, Rajiv Nagar, Faridabad.\nThe appellant had received 6 quintals of levy sugar from the wholesale\ngodown of CONFED, Faridabad in the month of May 1997 for distribution\nto the ration-card holders. After inspection of the registers, it came to the\nlight that the Depot holder had misappropriated 4 quintals 42 kilograms\nand 50 grams of sugar and there were blank entries in the register, which\nwere allegedly signed by the consumers. At the time of inspection, there\nwas no stock in the ration Depot. Furthermore, in the month of May 1997,\nthe Depot holder lifted 2860 liters of kerosene for distribution. The Depot\nholder had not made any entry regarding the quantity of kerosene\ndistributed to the ration-card holders. According to the register, the Depot\nholder had shown distribution of kerosene to 265 ration-card holders. If a\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nmaximum of 7 liters of kerosene per ration-card holder is taken into\nconsideration, then also the Depot holder could not distribute more than\nliters of kerosene. In this manner, the Depot holder had\nmisappropriated 1005 liters of kerosene. In the month of June 1997, the\nDepot holder had lifted 2860 liters of kerosene. No entry was shown in the\nsale register regarding quantity of the kerosene received and its\ndistribution to the ration-card holders. The Depot holder had shown the\ndistribution of kerosene to 280 ration-card holders. If a maximum of 7 liters\nof kerosene per ration-card holder is taken into consideration, then the\ntotal distribution will come to 1960 liters. In this manner the Depot holder\nhad misappropriated 900 liters of kerosene. \nThese violations gave rise to the presumption that the goods\nmeant for distribution through Public Distribution System were sold at a\nhigher price in the open market. For these alleged irregularities and\nviolation of the Quality Order, Special Judge, Faridabad served notice of\naccusation upon the appellant on 12th January, 1998. The appellant\npleaded not guilty and claimed trial. \nJ.B. Gondia, District Food and Supplies Controller, Faridabad\nappeared as PW-1. He reiterated as to what was stated in the complaint\nEx.PA, contents of which have been noticed above. In cross examination,\nthis witness stated that no ration-card holder came with any grievance at\nthe spot against the accused. However, the following suggestion was put\nto this witness: \n It is wrong to suggest that the accused was ill in those\ndays and in his absence kerosene and sugar were distributed\nto the card holders by his younger brother who might not have\nbeen able to maintain the record properly. I did not verify from\nthe card holders whose names were entered in the registers\nthat he or she had actually not received kerosene or sugar. It\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nis wrong to suggest that the accused has been falsely\nimplicated in this case. \nA perusal of the above suggestion reveals that the accused\nwas conscious of not maintaining the record. \nRishi Pal ASI PW-2 had arrested the appellant on 16th July,\n. \nRurra Ram ASI PW-3 was entrusted with the investigation on\nth June, 1997. He had recorded the statements of the witnesses and had\nalso prepared the rough site plan Ex.PB. \nProsecution has placed on record the Quality Order as\nEx.PC. Mr. Harbhagwan Singh, Senior Advocate appearing for the\nappellant, has extensively referred to the Quality Order Ex.PC. This order\ndefines a Dealer as under: \n 2.(b)  Dealer  means a person engaged in the business\nof sale or storage for sale of any article, whether such\nbusiness is carried on in retail or in wholesale, and include the\ndistributing agent of the selling agent of such person; \nClause 3 of the Quality Order reads as under: \n 3.\nThe Government may, by notification, in the\nofficial Gazette, in respect of any article;\n(a)\nthe maximum quantity which may, at any\none time, be possessed by a dealer or a\nproducer;\n(b)\nthe maximum quantity which may, at any\none time, be possessed by any consumer; \n(c)\nthe maximum quantity which may, in any\none transaction be sold to any person by a\ndealer or a producer;\n(d)\nthe quantities fixed in respect of any article\nunder this clause may be different in\ndifferent localities;\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nProvided that no stock limit shall be fixed in\nrespect of producers regarding sugar, khandsari, gur\nand shakkar. \nIt will also be apposite here to reproduce Clause 9 of the\nQuality Order: \n 9.(1) The physical stock balances of various articles in\na fair price shop, authorized and approved by the Government\nor by any officer authorized by it in this behalf, shall conform\nto the book balance as per account books maintained by him. \n(2)\nAll purchases, sales and production made will be\ncorrectly accounted for in the account books maintained and\nshall conform to the actual transaction made.  \nIt is contended before me that the Government has issued no\nnotification under sub-clause 1 of Clause 6. It is further submitted that in\nterms of Clause 3 also, no notification was issued. It has been urged\nbefore me that until under Clauses 6 and 9, the State Government had\nprescribed maximum quantity of any article which may be sold to any\nconsumer or group of consumers, it cannot be held that there was any\nmisappropriation of kerosene or sugar by the appellant.\nI have given my thoughtful consideration to the submissions\nmade before me. The prosecution may have failed to prove on record the\nsubsequent notification which prescribes maximum quantity of an article\nwhich can be issued to a card holder. It is evident that the prevailing\npractice demands that sale and stock registers ought to have been\ntruthfully filled by the appellant. The appellant is also conscious of this fact.\nTherefore, a suggestion was given that due to sickness, the appellant may\nnot have filled up the registers and the Depot was managed by his brother\nRam Parkash Tiwari. The statement of the accused under Section 313\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nCr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating circumstances were put to him.\nHe denied the same and stated as under: \n I am innocent. Entries in the registers Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-4\nare in the handwriting of my brother Ram Parkash Tiwari, who\ncommitted some mistakes. \nFurthermore, Ram Parkash Tiwari was examined as DW-1,\nwho in examination in chief stated as under: \n Vidya Parshad accused is my brother. On 11th of April,\nhe had gone to his native village as our mother was ill at\nthat time. He returned around 15th or 16th of June, 1997. In his\nabsence I had looked after the running of his ration depot. I\nhad distributed various articles to the consumers against\nration cards. I could not maintain appropriate entries in the\naccount books because of rush and my lack of experience.  \nThus, it is a case of the accused that the requisite registers\nwere not maintained and they had not depicted the quota received, the\nsales effected and the stocks available. Consequently, there was a\nviolation of Clause 9 of the Quality Order, which specifically provides that\nphysical stock balance of various articles in a fair-price-shop should\nconform to the book balance as per the account books maintained by the\nDealer. \nHaving held that the appellant had not maintained the\nregisters in consonance with the procedure prescribed, it is difficult for this\nCourt to assume that the stock not available was sold in the open market.\nThus, this Court at the most can say that the appellant was remiss in his\nduty to maintain the necessary registers and account books. The offence\nunder Section 7 of the Act is punishable for a term which should not be\nless than three months but which may extend upto seven years.\nFurthermore, all offences under the Act are to be tried in a summary\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nmanner under Section 12-A of the Act and the maximum sentence which a\nCourt can award for a summary trial is two years. \nThe inspection, in the present case, was carried in the month\nof June 1997. The appellant is in corridors of the Courts for the last about\nyears and he has suffered mental pain and agony of a protracted trial.\nSince this Court has already held that the appellant had failed to maintain\nthe requisite registers and the account books, it would be in the interest of\njustice in case sentence of the appellant is reduced from one year to three\nmonths rigorous imprisonment.\nWith the aforesaid modification in sentence, present appeal is\ndisposed of.\n[KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA]\nJUDGE \nMarch 23, 2010\nrps"
