Kansal, Advocate, for the petitioners.\nMr.PC Goyal, Assistant Advocate General, Punjab.\nCWP No.7331 of 1988 :2:\nMr.B.S. Wasu, Advocate, for Municipal Committees.\nMr.Raj Kumar Gupta,Advocate,for respondents\nin CWP No.14349 of 1992.\nMr.Arun Palli, Senior Advocate, with \nMr.Tushar Sharma, Advocate, for respondents\nin CWP No.15048 of 1992.\nPERMOD KOHLI, J. (Oral):\nSince common questions of law and facts are involved in these\nwrit petitions, the same are disposed of by this common order. \nThe petitioners in all these cases are aggrieved of the\nenhancement of the rental value of the premises which has been made the\nbasis for assessment of the house tax. The petitioners have relied upon\nSection 62 of the Punjab Municipal Act (hereinafter referred to as  the\nAct ) to challenge the assessment. From the bare reading of Section 62 of\nthe Act aforesaid, it is evident that this section applies where assessment is\nto be made for the first time. In the present cases, the properties are already\nassessed for the purposes of payment of House Tax and it is only the order\nof enhancement of the House Tax which has been impugned in these\npetitions.\nLearned counsel for the respondents has, however, taken the\nshelter of Section 67 of the Act. Section 67 of the Act permits\nreassessment or revision of the assessment under the circumstances\nindicated therein which, inter-alia, includes the erroneous assessment on\naccount of mistake, fraud etc. The present cases do not fall in any of the\nconditions. However, Section 65 of the Act deals with revision of the\nassessment list, but this requires a public notice. Admittedly, no public\nCWP No.7331 of 1988 :3:\nnoticed has been issued.\nApart from the above, the respondents have assessed the rental\nvalue without any parameters being adopted, primarily on the grounds that\nadjoining premises is fetching a particular amount as rent. The issue\nrelating to the assessment of the rental value has been considered by the\nApex Court in Dewan Daulat Rai Kapoor etc. etc. Vs. New Delhi\nMunicipal Committee and another etc. etc., AIR 1980, Supreme Court, 54,\nwherein the following observations have been made:-\n 11. .................We are, therefore, of the view that,\neven if the standard rent has not been fixed by the\nController, the landlord cannot reasonably expect\nto receive from a hypothetical tenant anything\nmore than the standard rent determinable under the\nAct and this would be so equally whether the\nbuilding has been let out to a tenant who has lost\nhis right to apply for fixation of the standard rent\nor the building is self-occupied by the owner.\nThe assessing authority would, in either case, have\nto arrive at its own figure of the standard rent by\napplying principles laid down in the Delhi Rent\nControl Act, 1958 for determination of standard\nrent and determine the annual value of the building\non the basis of such figure of standard rent. \nAdmittedly, in all these cases it is alleged by the petitioners that\nCWP No.7331 of 1988 :4:\nthe premises are governed by the Rent Legislation and in view of the\ndictum of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court, the rental value could be\nas is being received by the landlord or where there is no such material, the\nfair rent being payable under Section 3 (1) (b) of the Act, is applicable.\nIn view of the above circumstances, the impugned orders are\nunsustainable in law and are liable to be set aside. I order accordingly.\nConsequently, the maters are remitted back to the Municipal Committees\nconcerned for reassessment of the rental value in accordance with the\njudgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court mentioned above. The concerned\nMunicipal Committees will pass fresh orders after affording opportunity of\nbeing heard to the petitioners.\nWith these observations the writ petitions are disposed of. \nThe parties through their counsel are directed to appear before\nthe concerned Municipal Committees on 01.09.2009 for further\nproceedings. \nA copy of this order be placed on the record of each concerned\nfile. \n.07.2009\n(PERMOD KOHLI)\nBLS\nJUEGE \nNote: Whether to be referred to the Reporter? NO"
