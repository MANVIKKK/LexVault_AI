In this writ petition, on 20.12.1996, notice of motion was\nissued for 06.2.1997 and operation of Annexure P-5 (notice dated\n.11.1996) was stayed meanwhile. \nThe petitioners filed C.O.C.P.No. 65 of 1997 under Sections\nand 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 against Ram Kishan Gupta\nand Mange Ram for disobeying the order dated 20.12.1996 passed in\nC.W.P.No.19664 of 1996 titled Jai Parkash and others v. State of\nHaryana and others, on the ground that inspite of stay order dated\n.12.1996, both Ram Kishan Gupta and Mange Ram held meeting at the\nresidence of Ram Kishan Gupta on 29.12.1996, and passed a resolution\nregarding winding up of Dadri Education Society and its merger with\nDadri Educational Trust. \nThe contempt petition was contested by both the respondents\ntherein in which Ram Kishan Gupta had inter-alia pleaded that he\nremained admitted as an indoor patient in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital,\nNew Delhi from 04.12.1996 to 28.12.1996 and was discharged on\n.12.1996, therefore, he had no knowledge of the stay order passed by this\nCourt. However, this plea was not accepted and vide order dated\n.9.1998, it was held that both the contemners were aware of the stay order\nand the meeting that had taken place had wilfully floated the order dated \n Civil Contempt Appeal No 19 of 1998 -3-\n.12.1996. They were,thus, held guilty of Contempt of Court and were\npunished for simple imprisonment for a term of three months' each and\nalso a fine of Rs.2000/- each and in default of making the payment of fine,\nthey were ordered to undergo imprisonment for another term of 15 days.\nIt was ordered that if the fine is recovered, the same shall be paid to the\npetitioners by way of compensation. The contempt petition was allowed\nwith costs which was assessed at Rs. 20,000/- to be shared by both the\nrespondents equally. \nBoth Ram Kishan Gupta and Mange Ram filed separate\nappeals under Sections 19 (1) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971\nagainst the order dated 22.9.1998 passed by learned Single Judge, which\nwas registered as Civil Contempt Appeal No. 17 of 1998 titled as Mange\nRam v. Jai Parkash and others and Civil Contempt Appeal No.19 of\ntitled as Ram Kishan Gupta v. Jai Parkash and others. The appeals\nwere admitted on 29.4.1999. The judgment to the extent of awarding\nimprisonment and costs was stayed.\nWe have heard Mr.O.P.Goyal, Senior Advocate with Ms.Priya\nKhanna and Mr. R.A.Sheoran,Advocates, for the appellant(s) in both the\nappeals and Mr. Jaswant Jain,Advocate, for the respondents and have\nperused the record. \nAt the out-set, Mr. O.P. Goyal, learned Senior Counsel has\nsubmitted that his client Ram Kishan Gupta is an old man of 91 years of\nage and is a heart patient. He has further submitted that appellants hold\nthis Court and all other Courts established by law in the highest esteem.\nThe appellants also tendered unqualified apology and has purged the\ncontempt. Similar is the prayer made by Mr. R,A.Sheoran, counsel for the\n Civil Contempt Appeal No 19 of 1998 -4-\nother contemner Mange Ram.\n\nThough, we find that the contempt is made out , yet in view\nof the fact that the appellant Ram Kishan Gupta is 91 years of age, a\nheart patient and has purged the contempt, similarly appellant Mange Ram\nhas also purged the contempt, we deem it appropriate to set aside the\norder of sentence and reduce the amount of compensation to Rs.10,000/-\nonly in both the cases, to which counsel for the respondents has raised on\nobjection.\nWith above modification, both the appeals are hereby\npartly allowed and it is ordered that the sentence imposed upon the\nappellants by the learned Single Judge is of three months simple\nimprisonment, is set aside. But the appellants shall have to pay the fine\nas well as costs which is reduced to Rs.10000/- each in both the appeals\nto be shared by both the appellants equally.\n (Rakesh Kumar Jain) \n Judge. \nMarch 12,2008\n ( Mehtab S.Gill ) \nRR\n Judge"
