Plaintiff\nvs.\nSayed Abdul H.M.S.Kadri & another.\n... Defendants.\nAnd\nThe Associated Corporation of Industries\n(India) Pvt. Ltd.\n...Respondents.\n---\nMr.V.J.Makhija i/b. Mulla & Mulla, for Plaintiff.\nMr.V.T.Bhagat i/b. Vasant & Co. for Defendant no.D1(B).\nMr.Denzil D'Mello, for Respondents.\nCORAM: D.K.DESHMUKH,J.\nDATED: 26th September,2006\nP.C.:-\n.\nPerused the report. Perused the order dated 29.1.2003. By the\nreport the Receiver seeks modification of order dated 29.1.2003 passed by this\nCourt on the Receiver's report. Order dated 29.1.2003 reads as under:-\n\"The learned Counsel appearing for plaintiff /decree holder\nstates that there is no order passed in execution of the\ndecree, according to which, the Receiver can take\npossession of the property to which the decree relates. The\nstatement is accepted. In view of this statement, the\nReceiver's report is disposed of.\"\nAccording to the Receiver's report there is an order made by the Court directing\nthe Receiver to take possession of the property. Even assuming that the\nstatement made by the Receiver in the report is correct, the Receiver is\nappointed in execution of a decree for benefit of the decree holder. When the\nReceiver takes possession in execution of the decree obviously it is for the\nbenefit of the decree holder. But when the decree holder himself says that the\nReceiver is not entitled to take possession then, in my opinion, the inquiry\nshould end. The learned Counsel appearing for decree holder even today says\nthat there is no order authorising the Receiver to take possession of the property\nin relation to which the decree is passed. He has made the same statement\nbefore the Court on 29.1.2003 also, which has been recorded by the Court. In\nthis view of the matter, there is no point in Receiver maintaining possession\nbecause the Receiver is maintaining possession obviously for the benefit of the\ndecree holder. In this view of the matter therefore, the Receiver is directed to\nhand over the possession of the property back to the party from whom the\nReceiver has taken possession. The Report is disposed of.\n---"
