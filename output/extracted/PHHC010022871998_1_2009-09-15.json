Respondent. \nCORAM:- HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K.C. PURI\nPresent : Mr. Gurinder Pal Singh, Advocate for the revisionist \n in both cases.\n Mr. Rajeev Sharma, Advocate for U.T.Chandigarh\n in both cases.\nK.C.PURI, J.\nBy this common order, I intend to dispose of Criminal\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nRevision No.134 of 1998 titled Mohan Chand Joshi vs. State\n( U.T.Chandigarh ) and Criminal Revision No.135 of 1998 titled\nMohan Chand Joshi vs. State ( U.T.Chandigarh ) , as both the\nrevisions arise from the same FIR and against the same accused.\nFor convenience, facts are being taken from Criminal Revision\nNo.134 of 1998.\nThese are two revision petitions against the judgment\ndated 18.12.1997 passed by Shri S.S.Lamba, Additional Sessions\nJudge, Chandigarh, who dismissed the appeal, while reducing the\nsentence of imprisonment awarded by the trial Court from two years\nrigorous imprisonment to one year rigorous imprisonment and by\nmaintaining the amount of fine as Rs.1000/-, whereas Shri\nJ.S.Khushdil, learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Chandigarh vide\njudgment and order dated 17.5.1986 sentenced the revisionist to\nundergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years and to pay a\nfine of Rs.1000/- and in default of payment of fine to undergo\nrigorous impressment for three months holding him guilty under\nSection 409 of the Indian Penal Code (in short   the IPC). \nThe brief facts of the prosecution case are that on the\ncomplaint made by Chief Executive Officer, Haryana State\nFederation of Consumer Cooperative Whole Sale Stores,( in short  \nthe Federation) against the revisionist. It is alleged in the complaint\nthat revisionist was appointed as salesman in this Federation on\n.10.1973 and he took over the charge of the stocks of retail shop on\n.10.1973. The normal duties of a salesman were to receive goods\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nfrom the main godown through an indent duly signed by him and the\ngodown keeper after due checking and satisfaction and to sell the\nsame in retail at his shop at the rates and in accordance with the\npolicy approved by the Federation. After the close of the day, the\nrevisionist was required to prepare the sales summaries of the sales\nmade during the day and to hand over the sales proceeds of the day\nto the cashier of the Federation against receipt. He was also\nresponsible for stocking, selling custody and accountability of the\ngoods given to him by the Federation from time to time. The financial\ntransactions of the goods supplied to him and the sales duly made by\nhim were kept by the office of the Federation in a register called as\nStock Liability Register. The entries made in this register by the\noffice were also signed by the salesman in token of having accepted\nthe liability from time to time. The revisionist was also supposed to\nconducted physical verification in the presence of the salesman and\nthe list of goods physically verified is signed by the auditors as well\nas by the salesman in token of its correctness. According to physical\nverification report for the period ending 31.12.1975 the value of\ngoods in the custody of Mohan Chand, salesman, amounted to\nRs.88,119.53ps. This was taken as opening balance of stocks with\nthe salesman from 1.1.1976. The value of goods given to the sales\nfrom 1.1.1976 to 3.2.1976 as well as sales affected by him and the\namount deposited with the Federation. As per physical verification of\nthe stocks in the charge of revisionist for the period ending 30.6.1975\nand 31.12.1975 heavy shortages were found in the stocks entrusted\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nto him in the capacity of a salesman. The revisionist was therefore,\nasked to hand over the charge of his stocks to Ram Lal Godown\nKeeper and the same was handed over the charge of stocks worth\nRs.58,672-73ps to Ram Lal Storekeeper on 3.2.1976 whereas\naccording to the stock liability register, the value of goods in his\ncharge as on 3.2.1976 should have been Rs.67,397-20ps. There\nwas thus a shortage of stock duly entrusted to him in the capacity of\na salesman worth Rs.8724-47ps. which revisionist has embezzled.\nThe investigation of this case was conducted by SI Brij Lal, who took\ninto possession necessary documents and recorded the statements\nof the prosecution witnesses. After completion of necessary\ninvestigation, challan against the revisionist was presented in the trial\nCourt for trial. \nOn appearance of the accused in the Court, copies of the\ndocuments were supplied to the accused under rules. \nFinding a prima facie case, the accused was charge-\nsheeted under Section 409 IPC to which he pleaded not guilty and\nclaimed trial.\nIn order to establish its case, prosecution has examined\nVijay Kumar (PW-1), Sudama Mool Chandani (PW-2), Om Parkash\n(PW2/B), Jagdish Chander (PW-3), Ramesh Chander (PW-4),\nSubash Chander Jain (PW-5), K.N.Parshad (PW-6), Om Parkash\n(PW-7), Mohinder Singh (PW-8), SI Brij Lal (PW-9), SI Nana Ram\n(PW-10), K.K.Sharma (PW-11), Ram Lal (PW-12), Shri J.P.Gupta\n(PW-13), SI Sandel Singh (PW-14) and Nanak Singh (PW-15) and\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nthe evidence was closed by order of the Court as the prosecution\nfailed to conclude its entire evidence.\nAfter conclusion of the trial, the accused was examined\nunder Section 313 Cr.P.C., all the incriminating evidence was put to\nhim which he denied and pleaded his false implication. He has\nadmitted that he was working as Salesman. He has also admitted\nthat the goods were received from the CONFED Store through\nindent, and after that those were put on sale. He has admitted that\nthe entries were made by the storekeeper and his signatures were\nobtained. He has stated that the original liability register has been\nintentionally concealed by the prosecution, just to prosecute him. He\nhas stated that the signatures on the liability register were obtained\nunder pressure and undue influence. The accused has examined\nSher Singh as DW-1 and Suresh Kumar as DW-2 and then close his\ndefence evidence.\n The learned trial Court, after appraisal of the evidence,\nfound the accused guilty and sentenced him as narrated above. The\nrevisionist filed appeal against that judgment. The appellate Court on\nre-appraisal of the evidence did not find any merit in the appeal and\ndismissed the same, however, while reducing the sentence from two\nyears to one year only. \nStill dis-satisfied with the aforesaid judgments and orders\nthe accused/revisionist filed instant revision petition before this\nCourt.\nI have heard learned counsel for the revisionist and\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nlearned State counsel and have gone through the records of the\ncase. \nLearned counsel for the revisionist has submitted that\nprimary evidence of embezzlement is missing in the present case.\nThe liability register, which reflected all the entries in respect of\nissuance of articles to the salesman are incorporated in the liability\nregister. The original liability register has been withheld by the\nprosecution on the ground that there were cuttings in the entries in\nthat register. The new liability register was prepared. The signatures\nagainst the entries were taken by the Officers under the threat. Even\nsome of the entries do not bear the signatures of petitioner. Since the\nprimary evidence is missing and as such the prosecution has failed\nto prove the alleged embezzlement.\nI have considered the said submission and have gone\nthrough the records of the case.\nBoth the Courts below have thrashed this point and\nreached to the conclusion that preparation of new liability register\ndoes not create doubt on the prosecution version. Signatures of\nrevisionist appear on all the entries except one or two entries in\nrespect of issuance of articles. Even if, the entries, which did not\nbear the signatures of revisionist, ignored in that case also the\nembezzlement stood proved. Moreover, in this case, the primary\nevidence is not the liability register but the primary evidence is in the\nshape of issuance of indent for sale of articles by the petitioner, who\nhappened to be salesman at that time. The revisionist has failed to\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \ncount for the articles issued to him through indents and there were\nshortage, as observed by both the Courts below. So, no scope for\ninterference in the present revision petition is made out. \nThe learned counsel for the petitioner has further\nsubmitted that revisionist filed complaint against the other officers,\nwho have actually embezzled the amount. The learned Judicial\nMagistrate Ist Class, has not reached to the logical conclusion as\nprovided under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The\nbig guns have been shielded to make the petitioner scape goat. \nI have carefully considered the said submission but do\nnot find any force in that submission. In case the Judicial Magistrate\nIst Class, has not taken the cognizance, the petitioner would have\nthe remedy by filing a private complaint but he has not done so.\nSo, now after so many years, the petitioner cannot grumbled over\nthe said matter.\nLearned counsel for the revisionist has further submitted\nthat some time the goods were taken by the higher officers on credit\nbasis. The petitioner being a small employee could not say no to the\nofficers and helm of the affair. \n Both the Courts below have not considered this aspect.\n I have carefully considered the said submission but do\nnot find force in that. The goods alleged to be given on credit\nalthough not proved but according to the petitioner itself the value of\nthe same is very less i.e Rs.800/-. Even if, some officers have\ntaken the goods on credit in that case, the petitioner was required to\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nissue the bills and get the signature of that officers. But, there is\nnothing in this case on the file. So, the above said argument is also\nwithout any substance.\nLearned counsel for the revisionist has further submitted\nthat the petitioner has been discriminated. According to the policy of\nthe department, the salesman was entitled to have a shortage of half\nmeter per every than of cloth. This concession is allowed to the\nemployee as the same extra cloth has to be given to the person, who\npurchased the same.\nThe said concession has been withheld in the case of\npetitioner regarding shortage on account of embezzlement.\nI have carefully considered the said submission but do\nnot find any merit in that submission.\nEven if, concession of shortage by half meter is allowed\nto the petitioner in that case also the huge shortage of articles would\nnot be accounted for. The shortage can be in respect of the clothes\nonly. So far as other items such as tyres are concerned there\ncannot be shortage in respect of those items. So, the petitioner\ncannot have benefit of the above said argument. \nLearned counsel for the revisionist has submitted that\nthere is overwriting in some of the indents, the benefit of the same\nhas not been given to the petitioner. \nI have carefully considered the said submission but do\nnot fine any merit in that submission.\nNo specific act of overwriting prejudicial to the petitioner\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nhas been pointed out during the course of arguments. \nThe learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that\nin para-5 of the grounds of revision the petitioner has given the\ndetails in respect of shortage of value of Rs.82,686.58ps. against\nthe shortage of Rs.88,119.53ps if these six items are taken into\naccount, there is no shortage. \nI have carefully considered the said submission but do\nnot fine any merit in that submission.\nNo reasonable ground for arriving at the conclusion that\nshortage of the stock is counted for as detailed in para-5 of the\ngrounds of appeal. These figures have been made by the petitioner\nfor the first time in the revision petition, which cannot be looked into.\nThe trial Court has appreciated the evidence on the record of this\ncase minutely. The first Appellate Court reprised the said evidence\ncarefully and no scope is left for interference in the concurrent finding\nof both the Courts below proving guilt of the petitioner. \nConsequently, the conviction recorded by both the Courts\nbelow stand affirmed.\nSo far as quantum of sentence is concerned, the\nshortage relates to the period 1974-76 i.e. more than 33 years. The\npetitioner is facing the protracted trial since the year 1982 i.e. more\nthan 27 years. \nLearned counsel for the petitioner has stated at the bar\nthat the petitioner has undergone incarceration for a period of 70\ndays out of substantive sentence of one year. It would not be in the\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \ninterest of justice to send the revisionist to custody, who has been\nfacing the agony of trial for the last 27 years and had also undergone\nincarceration of 70 days. \nConsequently, the sentence is reduced to the already\nundergone by him. However, the sentence of fine under Section 409\nIPC is enhanced to Rs.3000/-. \nWith the above said modification in the sentence, the\nrevision petition stands disposed of. \nA copy of this judgment be sent to the trial Court for strict\ncompliance.\n\n( K.C.PURI )\n\n JUDGE \nSeptember 15, 2009\nsv"
