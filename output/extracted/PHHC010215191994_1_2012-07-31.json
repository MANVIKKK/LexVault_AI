No.8674 of 1994 (O&M) \n DATE OF DECISION : 31.72012\nDarshan Singh\nPETITIONER\nVERSUS\nState of Haryana and others\nRESPONDENTS\nCORAM : HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MAHESH GROVER\nPresent:-\nShri Rishi Raj for Shri Puneet Jindal, Advocate for the petitioner.\nShri Rajiv Kwatra, Senior D.A.G. Haryana.\nMAHESH GROVER, J. \nThe petitioner in this petition prays that the service rendered by him\non work charge basis followed by regularization be considered for grant of\npensionary benefits.\nThe petitioner joined the services of the State of Punjab, P.W.D.\nB&R Branch on 15.1.1947 as Lower Divisional Clerk and was subsequently\npromoted as Senior Clerk and Accounts Clerk. He continued to serve in the State\nof Punjab prior to its re-organization and subsequently worked with the State of\nHimachal Pradesh with effect from 1.11.1966 till 14.8.1967 when he resigned\nfrom there. He then joined services of the State of Haryana on 4.2.1971 as\nC.W.P. No.8674 of 1994 -2-\nAccounts Clerk-cum-Store Munshi as a work charged employee. On 2.6.1983 the\npetitioner retired on attaining the age of superannuation.\nIn the backdrop of the aforesaid facts, the petitioner has prayed for\ngrant of pensionary benefits which have been declined to him, and as a\njustification thereof, the respondents have stated in their reply that the petitioner\nwas brought on the regular rolls of the Department of P.W.D.(B&R), but the order\nof regularization could not be implemented because the petitioner failed to submit\nhimself for the medical examination which was the requirement. The date of\nregularization attributed to the petitioner is 28.8.1980 which is also evident from\nAnnexure R-1. \nThe solitary ground on which the prayer of the petitioner has been\ndeclined, has been noticed above i.e. the order of regularization not being\nimplemented on account of non-cooperation of the petitioner who failed to submit\nhimself for medical examination.\nI have considered the matter and am of the opinion that the petition\ndeserves to be accepted. The petitioner has concededly worked as a work charge\nemployee with the respondents. His services were regularized on 28.8.1980 and he\nretired from the Department in 1983 on attaining the age of superannuation.\nMerely because he did not get himself medically examined, would not rob him of\nthe benefit of regularization more particularly so, when he continued to serve the\nrespondents in the year 1983 i.e. 3 years after the date of regularization. The\nperiods rendered by him as work charge employee prior to regularization would\ntherefore, need to be counted for the purposes of pension keeping in view the\nobservations of a Full Bench of this Court in Kesar Chand v. State of Punjab\nThrough the Secretary, P.W.D. B&R, Chandigarh and others 1988(5) S.L.R. 27.\nThe writ petition is therefore, accepted and the respondents are\ndirected to count the service rendered by the petitioner as work charge employee\nC.W.P. No.8674 of 1994 -3-\nfor the purpose of pension. The needful be done within four months from today\nand the benefits be released within two months. \n(MAHESH GROVER)\nJuly 31, 2012\nJUDGE\nGD \nWHETHER TO BE REFERRED TO REPORTER? YES/NO"
