  "judgment_text": "Civil Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1989 \nIn the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, at Chandigarh.\n Civil Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1989\nDate of Decision: 17.12.2008\n\nRajinder Singh \n  Petitioner\nVersus\nState of Punjab and others\n  Respondents\n\nCORAM: HON BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA.\nPresent: Mr. A.P. Bhandari, Advocate \nfor the petitioner.\nMr. Satish Bhanot, Senior Deputy Advocate \nGeneral, Punjab, for respondent No.1.\nNone for respondents No.2 and 3.\nKanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia, J. (Oral)\n\nThe present petitioner has raised two fold submissions in the\npresent writ petition. It was stated by the petitioner that he joined as\nSecretary in the Municipal committee, Chheharta, District Amritsar in\nAugust 1957. The petitioner submitted that he has working in Class-I\nMunicipalities. At the time when Punjab Municipal Service (Recruitment\nand Conditions of Service) Rules, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as  the\nRules ) were enforced, there were 12 posts of Executive Officers of\nClass-I. Later on 14 more posts were created. Thus, there were 26 posts\nof Executive Officers of Class-I. \nThe petitioner has raised grievance against the advertisement\nCivil Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1989 \ndated 30.9.1987 issued by the State of Punjab for filling up nine posts of\nExecutive Officers of Class-I for the State of Punjab through direct\nrecruitment. Petitioner stated that since he acquired experience, the\naction of respondent-Punjab State is bad in issuing interview letters to\nthe persons for appointment as Executive Officers in Municipal\nCommittees Grade-I by way of direct recruitment. \n\nAn affidavit was submitted by the Under Secretary to the\nGovernment of Punjab in which it was stated that as per the 1975 Rules,\nnine posts of Executive Officers of Class-I in the State are to be filled up\nby way of direct recruitment in accordance with the Rules. It is stated\nthat six persons were absorbed as Executive Officers in Class-I\nMunicipal Committees in terms of Rule 5(1) of the above said Rules and\nas per Rules, 50% vacancies are to be filled up by way of direct\nrecruitment and 50% vacancies are to be filled up by promotion on\nseniority-cum-merit basis. \nMr. Bhanot has very categorically stated that the petitioner has\nretired.\nSecond grievance made in the present writ petition is that\npetitioner had discharged his duties as Executive Officer of Class-I in\nClass-I Municipal Committees in his own pay scale, therefore, he is\nentitled to be paid salary as per the scale which were admissible to the\nExecutive Officer Class-I. Petitioner has stated that since he had\ndischarged his duties as Executive Officers Class-I the maxim of  Equal\nPay for Equal Work  has to operate in his favour and State is bound to\npay the salary to him as the Executive Officer Grade-I.\nIn reply filed, it has been submitted that till the direct recruits\nCivil Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1989 \nwere to be appointed on the administrative ground, petitioner as\nExecutive Officers Class-II was asked to discharge duties as Executive\nOfficer Grade-I. It has been stated that petitioner was neither appointed\nas Executive Officers Class-I by way of direct recruitment nor by way of\npromotion. If due to the exigencies of situation, an employee, till the new\nincumbent arrived, working in a lower grade is asked to discharge duties\non a similar post having a higher grade as a stop gap arrangement, he\ncannot claim that he should be paid salary according to the higher grade.\nMr. Bhanot states that later all the petitioner was promoted as\nExecutive Officer Class-I.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon Smt. P.\nGrover v. State of Haryana 1983(2) Services Law Reporter 734, in\nwhich it was held that where a person is promoted and is paid lower\nscale that cannot be sustained. This judgment is of no help to the\npetitioner to the present writ petition as in the present case there was no\npromotional order of the petitioner. He was to only discharge duties till\nthe direct incumbents were appointed. Petitioner was Executive Officer\nof Municipal Committee Grade-II, simply because he was discharging the\nsame duties in Municipal Committee Grade-I, it will not be held that he\nwas discharging the duties of a post which carried some onerous\nresponsibility. \nSimilarly, the other two judgments rendered in Anand Parkash\nv. State of Punjab 2005(3) Recent Services Judgments 749 and\njudgment rendered by learned Single Bench of this Court in Satish\nKumar and Others v. State of Haryana (Civil Writ Petition No. 8615\nof 1991 decided on 20.10.1993) are of no help to the petitioner as in\nCivil Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1989 \nSatish Kumar's case (supra), petitioner was not considered for\npromotion. In the present case, post was meant for direct recruits. Since\nthe petitioner was not discharging duties of higher responsibility,\ntherefore, he is not entitled to the relief sought.\n\nMr. Bhanot states that at the relevant time, services rendered\nin Municipal Committee Grade-I was provincial service and the petitioner\nwas to be selected to become member of Municipal Committee Grade-I.\nHe cannot claim that he should be paid the salary which is due to the\nExecutive Officer discharging the duties of Municipal Grade-I.\n\nIt has been consistently considered and held by this Court that\nonly a regular selection by way of advertisement or from requisition made\nfrom the Employment Exchange shall vest right in the incumbent. A\nperson like petitioner discharging duties will not be entitled to the benefit\nof scale prevailing for that post.\n\nHence, there is no merit in the present petition, same is\ndismissed.\n(Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\n Judge\nDecember 17, 2008\n\n DK"
