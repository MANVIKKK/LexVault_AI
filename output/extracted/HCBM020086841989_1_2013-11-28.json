JAMDAR, J.\n DATE : 28 NOVEMBER, 2013\nP.C. : \nA prayer is sought for dispensing with filing of \nMisfeasance proceedings and for dissolution of the company under \nsection 481 of the Companies Act, 1956. One of the reasons given \nin the report is that there are no assets and no amount lying to the \ncredit of the company. However, in the report it is also mentioned \nthat the Ex-Directors have not responded for filing of statement of \naffairs of the company and it is stated, in the circumstances, that no \nBorey\n 1/2\nspb/\n 19cp171-89olr462-13.sxw\nuseful purpose would be served by keeping the company under \nliquidation. \nIf the Ex-Directors have not filed the statement of \naffairs, the official liquidator will not come to know whether there \nare any assets of the company. Therefore, the fact that the Ex-\nDirectors have not co-operated with the official liquidator cannot be \na reason for dissolution of the company. On the other hand, it is a \ncase for proceeding against the Ex-Directors for not filing the \nreturns. \nThe official liquidator will accordingly instead of \npressing this report, should file a report, seeking action against the \nEx-Directors. It is made clear that the official liquidator will keep \nin mind the above observations and, before proposing dissolution of \nthe company, shall ensure that all information has been supplied by \nthe Ex-Directors and all efforts are made by the official liquidator \nto find out assets of the company and it is only when absolutely no \nfurther progress is possible in spite of the co-operation from all \nconcerned, the dissolution needs to be proposed. \nThe report is disposed of accordingly. \n\n(N.M.JAMDAR,J.)\n ..\nBorey\n 2/2"
