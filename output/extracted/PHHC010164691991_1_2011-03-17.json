Barfi and others\n ...PETITIONER\nVERSUS\nState of Haryana and others\n...RESPONDENTS\nCORAM:\nHon'ble Mr. Justice Jasbir Singh\nHon'ble Mr. Justice Rakesh Kumar Garg\nPRESENT: Mr. Amit Jain,\nAdvocate, for the petitioner\nMr. Kamal Sehgal, Addl. A.G., Haryana,\nJasbir Singh, J. (oral)\nJUDGMENT\nThis writ petition has been filed with a prayer to quash\nnotification dated January 30, 1989, issued under Section 4 of the Land\nAcquisition Act, 1894 (in short the Act) to acquire a vast track of land\nincluding land owned by the petitioner falling in Khasras No. 5/23 and 14/3.\nFurther challenge has been laid to a notification issued on January 25, 1990,\nunder Section 6 of the Act. As per facts on record, land was acquired for a\npublic purpose, namely, for the development and utilisation of land as\nresidential and commercial area for Sector 30 at Gurgaon.\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 3759 OF 1991\n-2-\nHeard counsel for the parties.\nIn this writ petition, it is specific case of the petitioners that in\nthe land under their ownership, they have constructed the residential\nhouses. It is contended by counsel for the petitioner that discrimination has\nbeen done to the petitioner by not releasing their land, whereas a vast track\nof land was released in favour of a Company known as M/S Unitech Ltd.\nTo show that the construction was in existence, when notification under\nSection 4 of the Act was issued, reference was made to an averment made in\npara No. 4 of the writ petition, wherein it is only stated that the petitioner's\nresidential house is in existence in the land in dispute. To the contrary, in\nparagraph No. 2 of the writ petition, it is stated that the nature of the land\nowned by the petitioner was agricultural. Detail of the construction is not\ngiven. It has also come on record that when opportunity given, petitioner\nfailed to file any objection under Section 5-A of the Act. \n In the reply filed, it has been stated as under:\n 1. That the petitioner has not come to the court with clean\nhands at all. The petitioner had alleged in para No. 4 of the\nCivil Writ Petition that he has constructed a house on the land\nin dispute. In fact, the land in dispute was completely vacant at\nthe time of the issuance of the3 notification u/s 4 of the Land\nAcquisition Act. A survey was conducted fully in accordance\nwith law and the land in dispute was completely vacant at the\nrelevant time. Thus, the allegations regarding construction are\ntotally false and concocted. The petitioner has made false\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 3759 OF 1991\n-3-\nallegations with malafide intentions. The Civil Writ Petition\nmerits dismissal on this ground alone.\n. That the petitioner has not filed any objections u/s 5-A of the\nLand Acquisition Act at all. The petitioner has got no right to\nchallenge the acquisition proceedings at this stage. The Civil\nWrit Petition filed by the petitioner merits dismissal on this sole\nground \nThe respondents have taken a specific stand in the reply that\nwhen land was ordered to be acquired, it was lying vacant and further that\npetitioner has not raised any objection to the proposed acquisition. To the\nwritten-statement, replication was not filed to show that the construction\nwas in existence. Even photographs of the alleged construction were not\nput on record. So far as ground of discrimination is concerned, the same is\nalso not available to the petitioner. In the reply filed, it is stated that the\nland was released in favour of M/S Unitech Pvt. Ltd. Because a licence to\ndevelop that land, as a colony, has already been sanctioned in favour of the\nsaid company. As the petitioners have failed to file objections under Section\n-A of the Act, in view of ratio of judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nin Delhi Administration v. Gurdip Singh Uban and others , AIR 1999\nSupreme Court 3822, this writ petition is not maintainable.\nIn view of facts, mentioned above, no case is made out for\ninterference. Dismissed. \n\n( Jasbir Singh )\n Judge\n (Rakesh Kumar Garg)\nMarch 17 , 2011. \nJudge\nDKC"
