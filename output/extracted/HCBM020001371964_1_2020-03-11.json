Nanjiah Setty & Ors\n..Plaintiffs.\nVs\nJagdishprasad Poddar & Anr\n..Defendants.\nMr. Shreeprakash Shivram Poddar, Defendant No.2 is present in-\nperson. \n\nCORAM : B.P. COLABAWALLA, J.\n\nDATED :- 11th March, 2020.\nP.C. :-\n.\nToday this matter has been placed on board for\ndirections because it has been brought to my attention by the\nRegistry that though by virtue of amendment granted by order\ndated 23rd August, 1971 the heirs of defendant No.1 were brought on\nrecord, inadvertently the name of Defendant No.2 was deleted when\nthe amendment was carried out. Defendant No.2 Mr. Shreeprakash\nPoddar is in fact alive and present before me today. He has also\nproduced his Original Aadhar card as well as PAN card. The copies\nof the aforesaid documents have also been tendered to the Court and\ntaken on record and marked  X  and  X-1  respectively. Clearly it\nappears that defendant No.2 s name has been deleted by mistake. In\n/2\n-s-524-64.doc\nfact, the name of Defendant No.1 Jagdishprasad Poddar ought to\nhave been deleted as he expired on 30th November, 1970 as\nevidenced by the death certifcate produced by Defendant No.2\ntoday. The copy of the said death Certifcate is also taken on record\nand marked  X-2  for identifcation. In these circumstances, the\nRegistry is directed to delete the name of Defendant No.1 and\nrestore the name of Defendant No.2 in the papers and proceedings of\nthe above Suit and reconstruct the drawn up decree accordingly.\nAfter the aforesaid process is done, the Registry shall issue a\ncertifed copy of the drawn up decree to Defendant No.2.\n(B.P. COLABAWALLA, J.) \n/2\n-s-524-64.doc"
