Advocate General, Punjab \nfor the respondents\n*****\nG. S. SANDHAWALIA, J.\n.\nThe present writ petition has been filed under Articles 226/227 \nof the Constitution of India for issuance of a writ in the nature of Certiorari \nquashing the charge sheet dated 29.10.1987(Annexure P-1) issued to the \npetitioner by the Government of Punjab, Department of Vigilance and show \ncause notice dated 30.1.1990 (Annexure P-2) whereby penalty of \ndismissal from service was proposed to be imposed upon him.\n.\nThe allegation levelled against the petitioner who was serving \nas a Junior Engineer was that during the period from 1.1.1981 to \n.3.1982, he had built a house at Rampura Phul on which he spent ` \n/- thereby he incurred expenditure disproportionate to his known \nsources and the enquiry was held by the Enquiry Officer, Vigilance \nDepartment, Punjab. The petitioner had objected to the jurisdiction of the \nEnquiry Officer-respondent no.2 to hold enquiry on the plea that he was a \nnon-gazetted officer. The charge sheet dated 29.10.1987 was served \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-2-\n****\nrelating to a matter for the period from 1.1.1981 to 31.3.1982, which was a \nstale one. \n.\nThat in the written statement, it has been pleaded that the \npetitioner had been given full opportunity to give his view point. The \nenquiry was with jurisdiction as it pertained to indulgence in corruption by \nthe petitioner by acquiring disproportionate assets to his known sources of \nincome and, therefore, issuance of show cause notice dated 30.1.1990 \nwas within the jurisdiction of respondent no.1. The enquiry was started \nagainst the petitioner on the basis of a complaint and a check period was \nfixed from 1.1.1981 to 31.3.1983 to calculate the income and expenditure \nand it took long time in the collection of documents from various quarters. \nThe enquiry was completed in the year 1987 and it was established that \nthe petitioner was guilty of acquiring disproportionate assets beyond his \nknown source of income. Thus, there was no delay in initiating action \nagainst the petitioner.\n.\nThe writ petition was admitted on 12.3.1990 and ordered to be \nheard along with Civil Writ Petition No.9432 of 1989 and directed that the \nstay would be in the same terms as in the aforesaid writ petition. The \noffice has put up the file of Civil Writ petition No.9432 of 1989 and from \nperusal of the same, it goes on to show that further proceedings before the \nInquiry Officer were stayed in that case and subsequently passing of final \norder was stayed. The said writ petition was allowed vide order dated \n.5.2009 and the following observations have been made:-\n It is almost 20 years that the disciplinary proceedings against \nthe petitioner have been stayed. The petitioner must have \nretired from service. No useful purpose will be served to allow \nthe disciplinary proceedings to be continued after lapse of \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-3-\n****\nsuch a long period. Otherwise also from the admitted facts on \nrecord, it appears that the incident relates back to the year \n-82, whereas charge sheet was issued after a period of 3 \nyears and even the enquiry was constituted against after a \nperiod of 3 years. There has been a serious lapse on the part \nof the respondents in promptly initiating disciplinary \nproceedings. It is not deemed appropriate to allow the \ndisciplinary proceedings after the lapse of such a long period.\nThis petition is accordingly allowed, charge sheet dated \n.5.1985 and enquiry proceedings against the petitioner are \nhereby quashed. \n.\nA perusal of the record shows that the petitioner was charge \nsheeted on 29.10.1987 on the ground that he had incurred excess \nexpenditure of ` 90,967/- which was beyond his known sources of income \nand that he had not taken prior permission of the Government for \nconstruction of the house. Eventually, the charge was only established to \nthe extent of spending of ` 13,378/- more than known sources of income \nin the years 1981 to 1983 and it was on the basis of the said report, the \nshow cause notice was issued on 30.1.1990 proposing penalty of \ndismissal from service, which is now subject matter of the writ petition. The \nrespondents in their reply also admitted that a complaint had been received \nand the enquiry had been started in April, 1983 against the petitioner but \nthe charge sheet was only issued on 29.10.1987. As per the respondents, \nthere was no delay in initiating action against the petitioner as it took a long \ntime for collection of documents from various quarters. The Hon'ble Apex \nCourt in State of M.P. Vs. Bani Singh and another 1990 (Sup) SCC 738 \nhad held that if there is no satisfactory explanation for the inordinate delay \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-4-\n****\nin issuing the charge sheet, it would be unfair for the department to \nproceed with the enquiry. The said view was followed in State of A.P. Vs. \nN. Radhakishan 1998 (4) SCC 154 and it was held as under:-\n It is not possible to lay down any pre-determined principles \napplicable to all cases and in all situations where there is delay \nin concluding the disciplinary proceedings. Whether on that \nground the disciplinary proceedings are to be terminated each \ncase has to be examined on the facts and circumstances in \nthat case. the essence of the matter is that the court has to \ntake into consideration all relevant factors and to balance and \nweigh them to determine if it is in the interest of clean and \nhonest administration that the disciplinary proceedings should \nbe allowed to terminate after delay particularly when delay is \nabnormal and there is no explanation for the delay. The \ndelinquent employee has a right that disciplinary proceedings \nagainst him are concluded expeditiously and he is not made to \nundergo mental agony and also monetary loss when these are \nunnecessarily prolonged without any fault on his part in \ndelaying the proceedings. In considering whether delay has \nvitiated the disciplinary proceedings the Court has to consider \nthe nature of charge, its complexity and on what account the \ndelay has occurred. if the delay is unexplained prejudice to the \ndelinquent employee is writ large on the face of it. It could also \nbe seen as to how much disciplinary authority is serious in \npursuing the charges against its employee. It is the basic \nprinciple of administrative justice that an officer entrusted with \na particular job has to perform his duties honestly, efficiently \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-5-\n****\nand in accordance with the rules. If he deviates from this path \nhe is to suffer a penalty prescribed. Normally, disciplinary \nproceedings should be allowed to take its course as per \nrelevant rules but then delay defeats justice. Delay causes \nprejudice to the charged officer unless it can be shown that he \nis to blame or when there is proper explanation for the delay in \nconducting the disciplinary proceedings. Ultimately, the court is \nto balance these two diverse considerations. \n.\nThereafter in P.V.Mahadevan Vs. M.D.Tamil Nadu Housing \nBoard 2005(6) SCC 636, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed as under:-\n Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion that allowing \nthe respondent to proceed further with the departmental \nproceedings at this distance of time will be very prejudicial to \nthe appellant. Keeping a higher government official under \ncharges of corruption and disputed integrity would cause \nunbearable mental agony and distress to the officer \nconcerned. The protracted disciplinary enquiry against a \ngovernment employee should, therefore, be avoided not only \nin the interests of the government employee but in public \ninterest and also in the interests of inspiring confidence in the \nminds of the government employees. At this stage, it is \nnecessary to draw the curtain and to put an end to the enquiry. \nThe appellant had already suffered enough and more on \naccount of the disciplinary proceedings. As a matter of fact, the \nmental agony and sufferings of the appellant due to the \nprotracted disciplinary proceedings would be much more than \nthe punishment. For the mistakes committed by the \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-6-\n****\ndepartment in the procedure for initiating the disciplinary \nproceedings, the appellant should not be made to suffer.\nWe, therefore, have no hesitation to quash the charge memo \nissued against the appellant. The appeal is allowed. The \nappellant will be entitled to all the retiral benefits in accordance \nwith law. The retiral benefit shall be disbursed within three \nmonths from this date. No costs.\n Appeal allowed  \n.\nKeeping in view the above principles laid down and after \nbalancing the facts in the present case and keeping in view the fact the \nrespondents have been unable to explain satisfactorily the delay in charge \nsheeting the petitioner even through they had received a complaint in 1983 \nand the said delay would necessarily have prejudiced the case of the \npetitioner to give a satisfactory explanation. In spite of the delay in \ninitiating the proceedings, it is apparent that the petitioner still successfully \nwas able to establish that he had not incurred excess expenditure of ` \n,967/- as alleged and the charge was only established to the extent of ` \n,378/-. Had the proceedings been initiated expeditiously, the prejudice \nwould have not been caused to the petitioner.\n.\nThat the disciplinary proceedings were stayed by a Division \nBench of this Court on 12.3.1990, which was 22 years ago and the said \norder has remained in force for the last two decades, this Court is thus of \nthe opinion that it would be appropriate to draw a curtain on the \ncontroversy and put an end to agony of the petitioner, who was appointed \nin the year 1961 and by now he must have retired from service. \nAccordingly, the present writ petition is allowed. Charge sheet dated \n.10.1987(Annexure P-1) and show cause notice dated 30.1.1990 \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-7-\n****\n(Annexure P-2) whereby penalty of dismissal from service was proposed \nto be imposed upon the petitioner are quashed.\n(G.S.SANDHAWALIA)\n JUDGE\n.2.2013\nPka\nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-8-\n****"
