  "judgment_text": "Criminal Revision No. 497 of 1995 \nIn the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh.\n\nCriminal Revision No. 497 of 1995\nDate of Decision: 14.2.2008.\nJarnail Singh\n\n  Petitioner\nVersus\nState of Punjab\n\n  Respondent\nCORAM: HON BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH \n\nAHLUWALIA\nPresent: Mr. R.K.Dadwal, Advocate \nfor the petitioner.\nMr. Mehardeep Singh, Assistant Advocate\nGeneral, Punjab, for the State.\n\nKanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia, J. (Oral)\n\nJarnail Singh son of Darbara Singh, who was driving the bus\nbearing registration No. PAB-5108 has been found by the Courts below\nthat due to his act of rash and negligent driving he hit the cycle of\nNawab alias Bittu due to which he died at the spot. In the present case,\non July 20, 1995, at a motion hearing, learned Bench passed the\nfollowing order:-\n Mr. K.S.Dadwal, Advocate\nHeard the learned counsel and perused\nthe impugned order. This revision is admitted qua\nCriminal Revision No. 497 of 1995 \nsentence only. The petitioner deserves to be\nadmitted to bail and is enlarged on bail subject to his\nfurnishing bail bonds to the satisfaction of the Chief\nJudicial Magistrate, Jalandhar.\n.7.1995\n(K.K.SRIVASTAVA)\nJUDGE \nSince the learned Judge after hearing the counsel and\nperusing the impugned order found not to interfere on the merits of the\ncase, the Court need not to dwell on the factual position of the case. \nMr. R.K.Dadwal has very fairly stated that due to the order\npassed at the motion hearing, he will confine his argument only on\nquantum of sentence. It has been stated before me that in the present\ncase, accident has taken place in the year 1991. A period of 17 years is\ngoing to lapse. From the head note of the trial Court judgement, the age\nof the petitioner is given as 32 years. Mr. Dadwal has stated that in the\nlast 17 years, petitioner has fastened himself with many liabilities of the\nfamily and children. Sending him behind the bars will cause stigma and\nwill have an affect on the marriage prospects of his children. It has been\nfurther stated at bar that petitioner, in the last 17 years, has committed\nno offence.\nHon ble the Apex Court has taken a view that in cases of\naccident, probation should not be granted. The petitioner is said to have\nundergone about one week behind the bars. His sentence from one year\nwas reduced to nine months by the learned Appellate Court in the year\n. For the last 13 years much water has flown. \nTaking protracted trial into consideration and fact that sending\nCriminal Revision No. 497 of 1995 \nthe petitioner behind the bars will serve no useful purpose, I deem it\nappropriate to compensate the family of the deceased by awarding a\nfine of Rs.50,000/-, which will be given as compensation to the legal\nheirs of the deceased. On deposit of Rs.50,000/-, the sentence of\npetitioner shall stand reduced to already undergone. Sentence of fine\nshall be deposited in the trial Court on 15.5.2008. Non-deposit of fine by\nthe petitioner will render this petition as dismissed.\nWith these modifications, the present revision petition is\ndisposed off.\n (Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\n Judge\nFebruary 14, 2008\n\n DK"
