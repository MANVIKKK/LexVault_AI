In default of payment of fine, he shall\nfurther undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of\none month.\nFeeling dissatisfied with the judgment of the\nlearned Judicial Magisttrate, Ist Class, Mahendergarh,\nCrl. Revision No.295 of 1996.\nfirst appeal was preferred but the appeal was dismissed\nby the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Narnaul. \nLearned counsel for the revisionist argued that\noccurrence is dated 30.1.1988. At that time, revisionist\nwas 54 years old. Now he is aged 75 years. Revisionist is\nthe first offender. Impugned judgment is not challenged\non the point of conviction. The learned counsel requested\nthat a lenient view be taken on the point of sentence and\norder the revisionist to undergo imprisonment already\nundergone because the revisionist remained in custody\nabout one and a half month. \nMr. K.S.Godara, Deputy Advocate General,\nHaryana, for the respondent argued that there is no\ndispute that the revisionist is 75 years old. Occurrence\nwas in the month January, 1988. He raised no objection\nif lenient view is taken in the matter of sentence.\nEvidence on the file shows that Government\nFood Inspector along with other officials on 30.1.1988 at\nabout 5.30 P.M. had raided the Kiryana shop of the\nrevisionist. Revisionist was found in possession of 2 Kg\nof Zeera kept for public sale. Against payment,\nGovernment Food Inspector demanded 450 grams of\nZeera. Notice in From VI regarding taking of sample of\nZeera was prepared but without signing the same\nCrl. Revision No.295 of 1996.\nrevisionist had fled away from the spot after giving a\npush to the Food Inspector. In view of the evidence of\nthe officials, both the Courts below had rightly opined\nthe revisionist committed an offence punishable under\nSection 16(1) (c ) of the Act.\nAt the time of commission of crime, revisionist\nwas 54 years old. Now he is about 75 years. Occurrence\nis dated 30.1.1988. Revisionist remained in custody for\nabout one and a half month. Revisionist is to become a\nhard criminal if he is sent to jail to undergo\nimprisonment, as ordered by the trial Court. \nKeeping in view the nature of offence and\nantecedents of the revisionist, I take a lenient view and\norder the revisionist to undergo imprisonment already\nundergone and he is also ordered to pay a fine of\nRs.15000/-. Rs. 15,000/- is to be deposited before the trial\nCourt within two months. In case the revisionist fails to\npay the fine, the revision shall stand dismissed.\nWith this modification, on the point of\nsentence, revision being without merit is dismissed.\n.7.2009\n( JORA SINGH )\nAnoop\n JUDGE"
