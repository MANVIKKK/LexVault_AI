  "judgment_text": "Crl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[1]\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT\nCHANDIGARH\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\nDate of decision: 17.10.2007\nRaghbir Singh \nPetitioner\nVersus\nState of Haryana \nRespondent\nCoram:\nHon'ble Mr. Justice Harbans Lal\nPresent:\nMr. Ajay Kansal, Advocate for the revisionist.\nMr.PS Sullar, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana\nHarbans Lal, J.\nThis revision is directed against the judgment dated 5.2.1992\nrendered by the Court of Shri Darshan Singh, Judicial Magistrate Ist Class,\nHisar, whereby he convicted and sentenced the revision petitioner to\nundergo RI for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- or in\ndefault thereof to further undergo RI for a period one and half month, as\nwell as judgment dated 8.7.1994 rendered by the learned Additional\nSessions Judge, Hisar vide which the period of substantive sentence\ninflicted by the learned trial Court has been reduced from 6 months rigorous\nimprisonment to three months rigorous imprisonment maintaining the\namount of fine of Rs.1000/- as well as its default clause.\nAs set up by the prosecution, the revisionist- Raghbir Singh is a\nbus conductor in the employment of Haryana Roadways and is posted in the\nOffice of General Manager, Haryana Roadways, Hisar (hereinafter to be\nreferred as   the G.M. ). On 30.6.1990 he was entrusted with bus fare\ntickets of the value of Rs. 27584/- for being issued to the passengers. He\ndid not deposit the tickets nor the sale proceeds thereof. Thereupon, the\nG.M. sent a letter Ex.PW3/A to S.H.O., Police Station City Hisar on\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[2]\n.7.1990. On its basis, FIR Ex.PW5/A was recorded. The revisionist was\nplaced under suspension vide order dated 12.9.1990. He put in his\nappearance before the G.M. on 12.11.1990 and explained his absence from\n.7.1990 to 13.11.1990. The latter sanctioned earned leave to the\nrevisionist for the aforesaid period vide order dated 21.11.1990 (copy\nEx.D2) and ordered his reinstatement w.e.f. 14.11.1990. He deposited a sum\nof Rs. 25052/- on 5.10.1990.\nMr. Ajay Kansal, Advocate appearing for the revisionist has\nstrenuously urged that as emanates from the evidence produced in defence,\nthe revisionist remained at rest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and on leave from\n.7.1990 to 30.11.1990, which leave no scope for doubt that he never\nremained on duty after 30.6.1990 and as its consequence, there was no\noccasion for him to sell the tickets. He further puts that he deposited\nRs.25402/- as well as the unsold tickets in the office of the G.M. on\n.10.1990 and in turn, the latter had written a letter for withdrawal of the\ncase and in these premises, no criminal offence is made out against the\nrevisionist. \nHe further submits that in view of the legal position laid down\nin re: State of Punjab vs. Amarjit Singh, 1992(1) Recent Criminal\nReports, 619, the courts below have gravely erred in recording the\nconviction of the petitioner.\nThe next argument raised by the counsel appearing for the\nrevisionist is that the prosecution has utterly failed to prove by leading any\nevidence on the file that the tickets issued to the revisionist on 30.6.1990 \nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[3]\nwere sold by him and in the absence of the same, no criminal offence under\nSection 409 of the Indian Penal Code is made out. He further added to it\nthat as transpires from the evidence trickled from the respective mouths of\nthe prosecution witnesses, the revisionist was not on duty and was on\nrest/leave from 1.7.1990 till 13.11.1990 and these circumstances lead to the\nonly inference that after 30.6.1990 he never remained on duty. \nTo tide over these submissions Mr. PS Sullar, Deputy Advocate\nGeneral, Haryana has maintained that the said amount was deposited by the\nrevisionist after registration of the case and as would be apparent from the\nevidence, revisionist got manipulated the sanction of his leave and thus, it\nwould be going too far to say that the charged offence is not established\nagainst the revisionist.\nI have given a deep and thoughtful consideration to the rival\nsubmissions. In Amarjit Singh's case (supra), on 29.4.1982, Amarjit\nSingh, who was working as a Conductor in Pepsu Road Transport\nCorporation, (for short 'PRTC') absented himself from his duty with a sum\nof Rs.3254.55 of PRTC, Kapurthala. The case was got registered against\nhim. The Division Bench of this Court was pleased to observe as under :\n After accepting the deposit of Rs. 2804/- from the\nrespondent on August 17,1982, it does not lie in the\nmouth of Pepsu Road Transport Corporation to urge\nthat the charge of criminal breach of trust against the\naccused in respect of allegedly misappropriated amount\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[4]\n still subsists. Regarding failure of the accused to return\nthe unsold tickets it has been held by the Supreme Court\nin Sardar Singh vs. State of Haryana, AIR 1977 Supreme\nCourt 1766 that merely failure or omission to return\nproperty does not constitute an offence under Section\nof the Indian Penal Code, Relevant observations\nread, what the section requires is something much more\nthan mere failure or omission to return the receipt book,\nThe prosecution has to go further and show that the\nappellant dishonestly misappropriated or converted the\nreceipt book to his own use or dishonestly used or,\ndisposed of it. That, we are afraid, the prosecution has\nnot been able to do in the present case. We are,\ntherefore, of the view that the appellant was wrongly\nconvicted under Section 409. Finding of not guilty\nreturned by the learned trial court is, therefore,\naffirmed. \nTo my mind, the case in hand is manifestly covered by Amarjit\nSingh's case (supra). A glance through Ex.D1 would reveal that an amount\nof Rs. 25402/- was deposited by the revisionist on 5.10.1990 with the\nconcerned authority of Haryana Roadways. As per Ex.D1/A the tickets\nbox as well as the value of the sold tickets were deposited on the said date\nby the revisionist. As emerges out of Ex.D2, another order, earned leave\nwas sanctioned for the period from 16.7.1990 to 13.11.1990 in favour of the\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[5]\nrevisionist by the competent authority. As revealed by Ex.D4, he was on\nrest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and on leave from 5.7.1990 to 15.7.1990.\nThis official record is a clincher towards the fact that the revisionist\nremained on rest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and thereafter he proceeded on\nearned leave which has been duly sanctioned by the competent authority.\nThe prosecution has not adduced any cogent, convincing and clear evidence\nleading to the conclusion that right from 1.7.1990 onwards, he remained on\nduty and had sold the tickets of Bus fare. It is own evidence of the\ncomplainant in the form of above discussed documents that the revisionist\nwas on rest/leave during the above mentioned period. If so, how he could be\nexpected to have sold the tickets. It is probable that when the revisionist\nlearnt about the registration of case against him, he on some advice\ndeposited the amount of Rs.25402/- alongwith tickets to save his job. As\nalready noticed, there is no evidence regarding sale of tickets by the\nrevisionist. He could have sold the tickets only to the Bus passengers. The\nprosecution has not produced any evidence as to on which Bus he was a\nconductor when he sold tickets. The revisionist after registration of the case\nmight had apprehended his suspension and arrest in the case. To get rid of\nthe same he might have thought to return some tickets and cash in lieu of\nthe other tickets. \nIn re: Pushpa Kumar Rai v. State of Sikkim 1978 Criminal\nLaw Journal, 1379, their Lordships were pleased to observe that even if it is\nassumed that the accused had collected the amount, the offence did not fall\nunder Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code which deals with breach of trust\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[6]\n by public servants and others. It was remarked as under:-\n In this case, therefore, even assuming that the accused\nwas a conductor of the Bus of the Sikkim Nationalised\nTransport as alleged and in such capacity collected bus\nfares amounting to Rs. 2826.60p. as alleged or any other\namount and failed to deposit the said amount, the\naccused can never be said to have been entrusted with\nthat amount because the said amount was never 'made\nover' or 'transferred' or 'handed over', to the accused by\nanyone on behalf of the Sikkim Nationalised Transport.\nIt also appears that in the charge itself the learned\nSessions Judge did not state that the accused was\nentrusted with any amount but only stated that the\naccused was  entrusted with collecting the bus fares . I\nam afraid that being entrusted with the doing of a job is\nnot the same thing as being entrusted with any property\nwithin the meaning of S. 405 and other congnate\nSections of the I.P.C. even though some money or other\nproperty may come into the hand of the person in the\ncourse of his doing such job. That being so, I am of the\nopinion that there was absolutely no material on record\nto frame a charge under S.409 against the accused. And\nif the charge framed was such as could not be framed on\nthe materials on record, a plea of guilty to such a charge\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[7]\n is no plea in the eye of law and cannot be relied on by\nany Court, as the basis of any conviction. The learned\nSessions Judge was, therefore, wrong in convicting the\naccused on the basis of his plea to the charge as framed\nby him and the order of conviction and sentence passed\nby him must, therefore, be set aside \nIn re: Sardar Singh v. State of Haryana (1977) 1 Supreme\nCourt Cases 463, their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court were\npleased to observe as under:\n An essential ingredient of the offence under Section 405\nis that the accused being in any manner entrusted with\nproperty or with dominion over property, dishonestly\nmisappropriates or converts to his own used that\nproperty or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property\nin violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode\nin which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal\ncontract, express or implied, which he has made\ntouching the discharge of such trust.\nSection 409 can be invoked only if it can be shown that\nthe accused being in any manner entrusted with property\nor with dominion over property in his capacity as public\nservant committed criminal breach of trust in respect of\nthat property. It requires something much more than\nmere failure or omission to return the property.\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[8]\nIn the present case, the prosecution has not been able to\nshow that the accused dishonestly misappropriated or\nconverted the property to his own use or dishonestly\nused or disposed of it. Hence the conviction under\nSection 409 cannot stand. \nReverting back to the facts of the instant case, the prosecution\nhas not inducted any evidence to the effect that the revisionist had\ndishonestly misappropriated or converted the tickets to his own use or\ndisposed of the alleged entrusted property in violation of any direction of\nlaw. There being dearth of such evidence, the offence is not established in\nview of the observations recorded in re: Sardar Singh's case (supra).\nIn re: Harbhajan Lal vs. State of Punjab, 1984 (1) Recent\nCriminal Reports (Criminal) 567, the bus conductor had failed to return the\nunused tickets. The case under Section 409 of the Code was got registered\nagainst him. There was no evidence to the effect that the accused had sold\nthe tickets and realized the amount. The Division Bench of this Court in\nthese circumstances was pleased to hold that no case of misappropriation is\nmade out unless there is a clear evidence that accused had realized the\namount. Adverting to the facts of the current case, the defence evidence\nnullifies the prosecution case. Had the revisionist worked during the\ninterregnum of 1.7.1990 to 13.11.1990, his rest/leave might had not been\nsanctioned. At the cost of repetition, it deserves to be pointed out here that,\nif he had worked on any Bus during the said period, the prosecution might\nhad got proved the way bill of such Bus. Only then it\n\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[9]\ncould have been inferred that he had the occasion to sell the tickets. Thus,\nthe prosecution evidence falls short of proof regarding the sale of the tickets\nby the revisionist. \nThe approach of a Court to very lightly brush aside the defence\nwitnesses cannot be approved. After all they are also the witnesses who\nappear in the Court to prove the defence and make the statements on oath.\nThe burden to prove the defence is not as heavy on the defence as it is on\nthe prosecution. the prosecution is required to esatblish its case beyond\nevery shadow of doubt, but the accused is only required to show to the\nCourt that the defence raised by him may not be fool proof, but is probable\nand plausible. If the Court is of the opinion that the defence appears to be\nreasonable and probable, then the Court is not entitled to reject the\nstatements of the witnesses. ( See Janggu alias Shobhit and others v.\nState of Madhya Pradesh, 2000 Criminal Law Journal 711 ).\nComing to the facts of the case in hand, the defence evidence,\nas noted supra, in the form of documents is probable, plausible and\nreasonable. Rather, the same knocks down the prosecution edifice. Thus,\nplacing abundant reliance upon the same, it is held that the prosecution case\ncollapses like a house of cards and sequelly, this revision succeeds and is\naccepted, setting aside the judgments of the Courts below and the\nrevisionist-petitioner is hereby acquitted of the charge. \nth October, 2007\n(HARBANS LAL)\ngsv\n JUDGE"
