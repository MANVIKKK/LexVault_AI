Said prayer \nwas reiterated by his subsequent applications dated 29/2/2008 \nand 27/3/2008.\n.\nCriminal Appeal Nos.739 and 748 of 1982 came to be \ndecided by a common judgment dated 1st August, 1984 by a \nDivision Bench of this Court and the sentence awarded to \naccused no.3 - Farooq Mirza Hussein Miya Ravi (accused no.1 in \nSessions Case No.508 of 1980) was directed to run concurrently \nwith the sentence awarded to him in Sessions Case No.509 of \n. It is apparent that in Sessions Case No.508 of 1980 the \napplicant was arraigned as accused no.1 and in Sessions Case \nNo.509 of 1980 he was arraigned as accused no.3. From the \norder of conviction and sentence passed in Sessions Case No.\nof 1980, these appeals came to be filed and while the \nappeals were allowed in respect of accused nos.1 and 4 partly, \nthe order of conviction and sentence against applicant-accused \nwas confirmed. From the report received by Mr.Pol from the \nYerwada Central Prison at Pune it is clear that no appeal was \nfiled from the order of conviction and sentence passed in \nSessions Case No.508 of 1980. In the said case he was \nsentenced for the offence punishable under Section 392 of IPC \non 31/8/1983 and sentenced to suffer RI for seven years. In \nSessions Case No.509 of 1980 he was convicted for the very \nsame offence and sentenced for the same period of seven \nyears as per the order dated 18/9/1982 and, therefore, the \nsentence awarded to him in Sessions Case No.508 of 1980 was \nto run concurrently with the sentence awarded and confirmed \nby this Court in Sessions Case No.509 of 1980 and in the \njudgment and order dated 1/8/1984 referred to hereinabove \nthis Court had extended the said benefit to the applicant. \nDespite this it appears that Criminal Writ Petition No. 3605 of \ncame to be filed before this Court which was decided on \n/8/1984 and it was directed that the sentence awarded in \nSessions Case No.508 of 1980 and Sessions Case No.1980 was \nto be concurrent and not consecutive. The applicant had \nsurrendered to the jail to undergo sentence on 8/10/1983. On \n/4/1984 he was released on parole of 30 days and he \nabsconded for almost twenty years i.e. till he was arrested on \n/4/2004. For the same he was punished and after his re-arrest \non 4/4/2004 he was also given the benefit of set off within the \nmeaning of Section 428 of Cr.P.C. and on suffering the sentence \nhe has been released on 12/8/2008 by taking into consideration \nthe orders passed on 1/8/1984 as well as on 7/8/1984 by this \nCourt for the benefit under Section 427(1) of Cr.P.C.\n.\nHence this application does not survive any further and \nthe same is dismissed as infructuous.\n (SMT.ROSHAN S.

Vashi for the petitioner.\nMr. D.B. Sawant for the respondent Nos.1 and 2.\nCORAM: ANOOP V. MOHTA, J.\nDATED: 23RD AUGUST, 2004.\nORAL JUDGMENT :\n.\nThe present Petition is under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution\nof India, filed by the petitioner (Assistant teacher) and thereby, has challenged the\norder and judgment dated 27th October, 1989, passed by the Presiding Officer,\nSchool Tribunal, Mumbai [for short  Tribunal ], in Appeal No. GEN/71/SND/3 of\n, whereby, the Tribunal, had allowed the Appeal but only granted the benefit\nunder Section 11(2)(e) of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools\n(Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 (for short  MEPS Act ) and\ndirected to pay six months' salary by way of compensation instead of\nreinstatement, although the termination order dated 30th March, 1988, of the\npetitioner was set aside. The Petitioner, being aggrieved, therefore, has basically\nprayed for reinstatement as permanent Assistant Teacher and all other benefits. \n.\nHeard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. The basic issue\nwhich needs to be answered in this Petition is the right of the petitioner, being an\nopen category candidate, to have a status of permanency as Assistant Teacher on a\nreserved post.\n.\nThe provisions of the MEPS Act and the Rules made thereunder\ngovern the recruitment and conditions of service of employees in private Schools.\nThe relevant Sections are Sections 4, 5 and 9. The relevant Rules are called the\nMaharashtra Employees of Private School Rules [for short `MEPS Rules']. The\nrelevant Rules, which covers the case in hand, are Rule 9 and 28. \n.\nThe petitioner was appointed temporarily in the post of Assistant\nTeacher for the period 1984-1985 and 1985-1986. Thereafter, he was appointed\non probation for a period of two years under Section 9(5) of the MEPS Act. The\nsaid appointment order itself contained a clause that his appointment would be\nsubject to the approval of the Education Department of District Sindhudurg. The\nrespondent-Management, however, by an order dated 30th March, 1988, terminated\nthe services of the petitioner. The petitioner, therefore, preferred an Appeal under\nSection 9 of the MPES Act and Rules. The School Tribunal, after considering the\ncontentions raised, including the written submissions filed by respondents, passed\nthe impugned order and held that the impugned termination notice dated 30th\nMarch, 1988, was illegal, invalid and improper. Accordingly, the Appeal was\nallowed. However, not granted reinstatement with back wages, after recording the\nstatement that 'a suitable substitute from S.T. category is posted'. The respondents\nwere directed to give him six months salary only. \n.\nIt appears from the record, as well as, the Written Statement filed by\nthe Management that the post in question was reserved for SC/ST candidate. As\nper the advertisement, the petitioner was appointed for the respective years, subject\nto the approval from the Education Department, Zilla Parishad, Sindhudurg. The\nsaid appointment was purely temporary. As there was no candidate available,\nbelonging to the said reserved category, petitioner was appointed temporarily, on\nthe said post. The said process was continued for two years more. The\nrespondent's case is that as the candidate belonging to the reserved category were\nnot available or did not respond to the advertisement and, therefore, were left with\nno choice, but to appoint the petitioner on a temporary basis. The foundation of\nthe respondents cannot be overlooked as the post was meant for reserved\ncategories and this post was always subject to the approval from the Education\nDepartment. There is no dispute that the petitioner belongs to the open category.\nThe petitioner's entitlement to enjoy the post, in the circumstances, would be\nsubject to the non-availability of reserved category candidate or such other\ncandidate. The fact that he was appointed from time to time from the year 1984\nupto 1987-1988, by that itself, nowhere gives any right to such candidate to claim\npermanency, even after expiry of the alleged probation period, in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case.\n.\nIn this background and in view of the submission as raised and as\nreferred in the Written Statement, as well as, recorded by the Tribunal in paragraph\n, I am also of the view that now, at this stage, i.e. after more than 15 years, it is\ndifficult to accept the prayer of reinstatement. The finding given by the Tribunal is\nalso justified to maintain the order to the effect that 'unless the said post becomes\nde-reserved', a candidate appointed temporarily on such vacancy of ST/SC\ncategory would have only status of 'temporary' candidate.\n.\nA candidate from the open category cannot claim a right of\npermanency, on the said reserved post. There is nothing pointed out that such post\nbecomes de-reserved automatically after lapse of time or any other such things. In\nthe circumstances, appellant being open category candidate would have no right to\nhold the post meant for reserved category candidate. The `quota' or any action\nbased on the Reservation Policy cannot be disturbed without following the due\nprocedure of law. \n.\nIt needs to be mentioned here that if candidates belonging to the\nSC/ST category are not available, the petitioner's case may be considered by the\nManagement, if there is still a vacancy and/or the post is still required to be filled\nin. However, the Management is at liberty to consider this aspect, if a case is\nmade out on merit.\n.\nIn view of this observation, I decline to interfere with the finding\nrecorded by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, dated 27th October, 1989,\nhence termination is upheld.\n.\nThe Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of. No order as to costs.\nCertified copy expedited.\n [ANOOP V. MOHTA, J.]"

By the\nreport the Receiver seeks modification of order dated 29.1.2003 passed by this\nCourt on the Receiver's report. Order dated 29.1.2003 reads as under:-\n\"The learned Counsel appearing for plaintiff /decree holder\nstates that there is no order passed in execution of the\ndecree, according to which, the Receiver can take\npossession of the property to which the decree relates. The\nstatement is accepted. In view of this statement, the\nReceiver's report is disposed of.\"\nAccording to the Receiver's report there is an order made by the Court directing\nthe Receiver to take possession of the property. Even assuming that the\nstatement made by the Receiver in the report is correct, the Receiver is\nappointed in execution of a decree for benefit of the decree holder. When the\nReceiver takes possession in execution of the decree obviously it is for the\nbenefit of the decree holder. But when the decree holder himself says that the\nReceiver is not entitled to take possession then, in my opinion, the inquiry\nshould end. The learned Counsel appearing for decree holder even today says\nthat there is no order authorising the Receiver to take possession of the property\nin relation to which the decree is passed. He has made the same statement\nbefore the Court on 29.1.2003 also, which has been recorded by the Court. In\nthis view of the matter, there is no point in Receiver maintaining possession\nbecause the Receiver is maintaining possession obviously for the benefit of the\ndecree holder. In this view of the matter therefore, the Receiver is directed to\nhand over the possession of the property back to the party from whom the\nReceiver has taken possession. The Report is disposed of.\n---"

In view of the\n pendency of the said recovery proceedings which is\n initiated by the secured creditors, it is not possible to\n sanction the sale of the properties at the instance of\n Official Liquidator in the present winding-up\n proceedings.

In view thereof I reject the present report\n made by the Official Liquidator. However, I direct the\n Official Liquidator to hold the properties subject to the\n orders passed by the D.R.T. in the said recovery\n proceedings which are pending before it. It is made\n clear that the Official Liquidator will hand over the\n possession of the premise as per the direction of the\n D.R.T. subject to recovery of necessary security charges\n and other expenses incurred by the Official Liquidator\n for protecting the said property.\n 2. Mr. Madon, learned counsel appearing for the\n Central Bank of India however states that security\n charges up to date has been paid and he further states\n that few security charges are also paid as per the\n direction contained in this order.

In paragraph six of this order the\nlearned Single Judge observed thus : \n A   perusal   of   the   report   of   the  \nOfficial Liquidator dated 19th April,\nwould ex facie demonstrate that\nthe Liquidator has not dealt with  \nthe claim of the Customs Authorities\nto   priority.   The   report   considers  \nonly the question of apportionment.\nIn fact in paragraphs 15 and 16 of \nthe affidavit filed by the Customs  \nDepartment   before   the   Official\n\nLiquidator, a claim of priority has \nbeen   raised.     Though   there   was  \ninadvertance   on   the   part   of   the  \nCustoms Authorities in not pointing \nout the subsequent directions of the\nDivision Bench dated 19th  December,  \nand 9th  January, 2004 when an  \norder was passed by the Court on 22nd\nMarch,   2007,   it   is   necessary   and  \nproper that in compliance with the  \ndirections   of   the   Division   Bench,  \nthe question of priority is \nconsidered   afresh.     In   order   to  \nfacilitate this parties shall appear\nbefore the Official Liquidator on 3rd\nMay, 2007 through authorised \nrepresentatives and/or Advocates at \n.00 a.m. when the Customs \nAuthorities shall be at liberty to  \nplace   all   their   submissions   in  \nregard to the claim of priority and \napportionment.     The   Warehousing  \nCorporations   would   also   be   at\n\nliberty to place their submissions  \non the record. The Liquidator shall\nafter considering the rival \nsubmissions place a further report  \nafter adjudicating upon the claim,  \nincluding the question of \npriority. \n.\nLearned   counsel   appearing   for   the   Central\nWarehousing Corporation and the Customs Department\nsubmitted   that   directions   sought   in   the   Report\ncannot be granted. They submitted that in view of\nthe   aforesaid   directions   given   by   the   learned\nSingle Judge vide order dated 21st April, 2007, the\nOfficial   Liquidator   ought   to   have   made   the   legal\nopinion   given   by   M/s.Billawala   &   Co   available   to\nthe Central Warehousing Corporation & the Customs\nDepartment and conducted a fresh hearing and only\nafter adjudicating upon the claim he should filed\nReport   before   this   Court.     Upon   perusal   of   the\ndirections given by this Court in the order dated\nst  April, 2007 and the prayer clause (a) in the\nReport I find substance in the submissions advanced\nby   learned   counsel.

The Official Liquidator by his report has\n proposed to declare dividend at the rate of 100 paise in\n a rupee to the Preferential Creditors aggregating to\n Rs.26,16,908/-. He has further proposed that dividend at\n the rate of 60 paise in a rupee be declared to the\n ordinary creditors amounting to Rs.75,71,525/-. The\n report also seeks permission to open a \"Separate Dividend\n Account\" with the Punjab National Bank, P.N.B. House,\n Fort Branch, Mumbai with a further direction to pay\n dividend from 21st November 2005 to 20th May 1996 and the\n balance amount which remains unpaid/unclaimed to be\n transferred to the \"Company s Liquidation Account\".\n : 2 :\n 2. The learned Advocate appearing for the Bank of\n Maharashtra and United Western Bank submits that even\n after paying 75,71,525/- as proposed by the Official\n Liquidator, a substantial amount would lie to the credit\n of the Company in liquidation. He, therefore, submits\n that dividend at the rate of 80% be declared for the\n ordinary creditors rather than 60% as proposed by the\n Official Liquidator.\n 3. In my view, this submission of the learned\n Advocate can be accepted as sufficient funds would be\n available to the Official Liquidator even after payment\n of dividend at 80%.\n 4. Hence, the following directions are issued :\n (a) The Official Liquidator to declare a dividend at\n the rate of 100 paise in a rupee for the\n Preferential Creditors amounting to\n Rs.26,16,908/-.\n (b) The Official Liquidator shall declare dividend at\n the rate of 80 paise in a rupee for all ordinary\n creditors.\n (c) The advertisement of notice of declaration of\n : 3 :\n dividend pursuant to Rule 276 of the Companies\n (Court) Rules, 1959, shall be published in Free\n Press Journal and Navshakti. Payment for the said\n advertisement be made from the funds lying to the\n credit of the Company (in liquidation).\n (d) Official Liquidator to open a \"Separate Dividend\n Account\" with Punjab National Bank, P.N.B.

The dividend shall be\n payable from 21st November 2005 to 20th May 2006.\n The unpaid/unclaimed amount, if any, from 21st May\nshall be transferred to the \"Company s\n Liquidation Account\" maintained with the Registrar\n of Companies, Maharashtra, Mumbai.\n 5. The Official Liquidator shall make payment of\n the dividend as early as possible and in any event\n within six months from today."

Talekar, Insolvency Registrar present in Court. \nCORAM : K.R. SHRIRAM, J.\nDATED : 7TH OCTOBER, 2016.\nP.C.\nThe Suit came to be settled by consent of the parties on 8th \nOctober 1985. Consent terms were drawn. A consent decree in terms of \nthe consent terms is passed. The consent decree states that it is to operate \nas a conveyance in favour of the Plaintiff.\nThe Consent Decree becomes a conveyance as defined under \nSection 2(g) (iii) of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958, which runs thus :\n S.2(g) Conveyance includes, \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) Every decree or final order of any Civil Court.\n(iv) \nBy which property, whether movable or immovable, or any \nestate or\ninterest in any property is transferred to, or vested in, any \nother\nperson, inter vivos, and which is not otherwise specifically \nprovided\nfor by Schedule I .\nWaghmare 1/3\n.s.2459.1985.doc\nHence a consent decree passed pursuant to Consent Terms operates as a \ndecree of the court. The said definition came into force on 10th December \n,   pursuant   to   the   substitution   of   the   definition   for   the   previous \ndefinition by the Amendment Act of 1985.\nUpon the consent terms operating as a decree of the court and \nbeing termed a conveyance in favour of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff derived \ntitle to the suit property. The Plaintiff as the owner of the suit property, \nacquired all the rights of ownership. The utilization and enjoyment of those \nrights require the original document of conveyance to be in the possession \nof the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff to be able to use the document to show his \ntitle.\nThis becomes essential more specially when the Plaintiff is \nrequired to transfer his title either by way of mortgage, sale, lease, etc, \nwhen the original document of title would be required to be handed over \nto the transferee.\nThe   Plaintiff   has   got   the   consent   decree   operating   as \nconveyance registered and stamped in accordance with Law. The Plaintiff is \nrequired to be returned the original document of title.\nWaghmare 2/3\n.s.2459.1985.doc\nAll original documents produced by parties are, as a matter of \npractice returned to them after the final judgment is pronounced and the \nsuit is disposed of. There is, therefore, no reason not to return the original \ndocument of title to the Plaintiff.\nFurther, this issue has been dealt with by a decision of this \nCourt  in  K.   Raheja  Corporation   Private   Limited   Vs   Mrs  Goolestan   Peter  \nCoelho and Others, where it was directed that a consent decree be handed \nover to the Plaintiff in that case.\nI also find support of an order dated 23.12.2015 passed in Suit \nNo.2225 of 1993. \nIn a matter such  as this,  therefore, the Plaintiff would be \nentitled to the return of the original consent decree. The office of the \nProthonotary and Senior Master shall make a certified copy of the consent \ndecree filed in the suit and operating as a conveyance to be kept on record \nof this suit and return the original decree to the Plaintiff within four weeks.\n(K.R.

Deshpande, Advocate for the Official Liquidator with Mr. Deepak\nPersoya, Official Liquidator\nCORAM :\nANIL L. PANSARE, J.\nDATE :\n-03-2025\nOn 21-3-2025, following order was passed. \n Heard.\n. \nThe Laxmi Bank Limited has filed this petition with\nfollowing prayers.\n(a) \nThat the company be ordered to be would up by\nthis Honourable Court under the provisions of the\nCompanies Act, 1956;\n(b) \nThe Official Liquidator or some other fit and proper\nperson be appointed as the Official Liquidator with all\npowers under the  . \n. \nThe Laxmi Bank Ltd. has averred that the company\nby name, Gopaldas Mohatta & Company Limited was\nincorporated at Nagpur on 25.05.1941. The name of the\ncompany was later on changed to  Navbharat Trading\nCompany Private Limited  (company under liquidation), in the\nmeeting of shareholders dated 28.07.1947. The authorized\ncapital of the company was Rs.10,00,000/- and the subscribed\nand issued capital was Rs.1,61,200/-. The company had\nmultiple objects including trading, financing, etc. It appears\nthat the company had issued three cheques to Laxmi\nInvestment Company Pvt. Ltd., total amounting to\nRs.1,35,000/-. It further appears that Laxmi Investment\nCompany Ltd. had a current account with the petitioner  \nbank at Bombay, Fort Branch. The aforesaid three cheques\nwere presented by Laxmi Investment Company Ltd., which\nwere returned with remark,  Refer to drawer . According to\nthe petitioner, the Company did not have sufficient funds in its\n:BHC-NAG:3212\n(2) cmp 8.1961\naccount with the said branch. The petitioner bank, however,\npaid the amount of the aforesaid three cheques drawn on\ncompany s account with an assumption that the amount of\ncheques deposited by the company in its account would be\nmet. According to the petitioner, the amount, that was payable\nby the company under liquidation was to the tune of\nRs.1,14,000/- and accordingly on 18.07.1961, the liquidator\nof the petitioner company addressed a notice of payment to\nNavbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd., calling upon the\ncompany to pay the sum of Rs.1,14,000/-. The envelope\ncontaining notice was, however, not accepted by the company\nunder liquidation.\n. \nI am informed that not only the company under\nliquidation i.e. Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. but also\nthe other company, Laxmi Investment Company Pvt. Ltd. and\nLaxmi Bank are under liquidation. In addition, a company\nnamely, National Commercial Corporation Ltd. was also under\nliquidation in Company Petition No.9/1961, which came to be\ndissolved by this Court vide order dated 09.06.2022.\n. \nThus, what remains is the three other companies\nwhich are subject matter of Company Petition No.8/1961\n(present petition) in respect of Navbharat Trading Company\nPvt. Ltd., Company Petition No.12/1961 in respect of Laxmi\nInvestment Co. Ltd. and Company Petition No.14/1960 in\nrespect of Laxmi Bank Ltd., the proceeding being initiated by\nthe Reserve Bank of India. The winding up proceedings\nagainst Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. have been initiated\nby Laxmi Bank.\n. \nThus, it appears that Laxmi Investment Company\nLtd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. were holding\naccounts with Laxmi Bank. It further appears that some\nfinancial benefits were extended by Laxmi Bank to Laxmi\nInvestment Company Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company\nPvt. Ltd and accordingly Laxmi Bank proceeded to file\nliquidation proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company\nLtd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. however, prior\nthereto Laxmi Bank itself was subject matter of winding up\nproceeding at the instance of the Reserve Bank of India. That\nappears to be the reason why Liquidator of Laxmi Bank has\nfiled the proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company Pvt.\nLtd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd.\n(3) cmp 8.1961\n. \nComing back to the present proceeding, the Official\nLiquidator submits that as on 31.12.2024, Navbharat Trading\nCompany Pvt. Ltd. has no assets except one fixed deposit of\nRs.1,48,117/-. The Official Liquidator submits that there are\ntwo creditors. One is Laxmi Bank, for Rs.3,60,000/- another is\nSales Tax Department, Akola for Rs.36,357/-. Mr. Deshpande,\nlearned counsel for the Official Liquidator, submits that the\nclaim of Laxmi Bank will have to be processed first, in terms of\nSection 529 of the Companies Act, 1956 and since the amount\nlying to the credit of the company is not sufficient to pay the\nentire amount of Laxmi Bank, the Company under liquidation\nis not in a position to pay dues to the Sales Tax Department,\nAkola.\n. \nThe Official Liquidator, however, seeks further time\nto verify whether there are any other assets belonging to\nNavbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd.\nStand over to 28.03.2025. \nAs could be seen, Laxmi Bank Limited has initiated the present\npetition. The amount due and payable to Laxmi Bank Limited is/was\nRs. 1,14,000/-. \n.\nThe Official Liquidator submits that there are no assets of\nNavbharat Trading Company Private Limited. He submits that the\namount of Rs. 1,48,117/- is, however, lying to the credit of company\nand accordingly, seeks permission to pay the amount to Laxmi Bank\nLimited after adjusting amount towards administrative and other\nexpenses. Permission granted. The amount be paid within two\nweeks from today. \n.\n The Official Liquidator shall pay to Laxmi Bank Limited\nthe amount which is lying to its credit after meeting administrative\nand other expenses.\n.\n The Official Liquidator submits that upon doing aforesaid\nexercise, nothing would remain with Navbharat Trading Company\nPrivate Limited to continue with liquidation proceedings and hence\n(4) cmp 8.1961\nrequest is made to dissolve the company under Section 481 of the\nCompanies Act, 1956.\n.\nThus, it appears that the Official Liquidator cannot\nproceed with the winding up of the company for want of fund and\nasset. It is thus just and reasonable to order dissolution of the\ncompany in terms of Section 481 of the Companies Act. Hence,\nfollowing order is passed. \nORDER\n(i)\nCompany named  Navbharat Trading Company Private\nLimited  stands dissolved in terms of Section 481(1) of the\nCompanies Act, 1956 subject to compliance of direction in paragraph\nno. 2 of the order.\n(ii) \nThe Official Liquidator shall forward copy of order to the\nRegistrar of Companies in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 481 of\nthe Companies Act.\n(iii) \nThe Official Liquidator shall file report of payment of dues\nto the Registrar(Judicial) of this Court within two weeks from today. \n(iv) \nThe company petition is disposed of in above terms.\n (Anil L.

The company was holding account with petitioner bank (which\nis also in liquidation). It appears that the company was not having\nsufficient funds. The petitioner bank, however, cleared the cheques\non the assurance given by the company to pay back the sum. Thus, in\na way, the Over Draft facility was extended by the petitioner bank to\nthe company under liquidation who failed to deposit the aforesaid\namount and accordingly present petition came to be filed.\n.\nHaving heard Mr. Shrinivas Deshpande, learned counsel\nfor the Official Liquidator, the status of the company is such that, to\nits credit an amount of Rs.6,00,000/- approximately is lying.

Vashi for the petitioner.\nMr. D.B. Sawant for the respondent Nos.1 and 2.\nCORAM: ANOOP V. MOHTA, J.\nDATED: 23RD AUGUST, 2004.\nORAL JUDGMENT :\n.\nThe present Petition is under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution\nof India, filed by the petitioner (Assistant teacher) and thereby, has challenged the\norder and judgment dated 27th October, 1989, passed by the Presiding Officer,\nSchool Tribunal, Mumbai [for short  Tribunal ], in Appeal No. GEN/71/SND/3 of\n, whereby, the Tribunal, had allowed the Appeal but only granted the benefit\nunder Section 11(2)(e) of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools\n(Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 (for short  MEPS Act ) and\ndirected to pay six months' salary by way of compensation instead of\nreinstatement, although the termination order dated 30th March, 1988, of the\npetitioner was set aside. The Petitioner, being aggrieved, therefore, has basically\nprayed for reinstatement as permanent Assistant Teacher and all other benefits. \n.\nHeard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. The basic issue\nwhich needs to be answered in this Petition is the right of the petitioner, being an\nopen category candidate, to have a status of permanency as Assistant Teacher on a\nreserved post.\n.\nThe provisions of the MEPS Act and the Rules made thereunder\ngovern the recruitment and conditions of service of employees in private Schools.\nThe relevant Sections are Sections 4, 5 and 9. The relevant Rules are called the\nMaharashtra Employees of Private School Rules [for short `MEPS Rules']. The\nrelevant Rules, which covers the case in hand, are Rule 9 and 28. \n.\nThe petitioner was appointed temporarily in the post of Assistant\nTeacher for the period 1984-1985 and 1985-1986. Thereafter, he was appointed\non probation for a period of two years under Section 9(5) of the MEPS Act. The\nsaid appointment order itself contained a clause that his appointment would be\nsubject to the approval of the Education Department of District Sindhudurg. The\nrespondent-Management, however, by an order dated 30th March, 1988, terminated\nthe services of the petitioner. The petitioner, therefore, preferred an Appeal under\nSection 9 of the MPES Act and Rules. The School Tribunal, after considering the\ncontentions raised, including the written submissions filed by respondents, passed\nthe impugned order and held that the impugned termination notice dated 30th\nMarch, 1988, was illegal, invalid and improper. Accordingly, the Appeal was\nallowed. However, not granted reinstatement with back wages, after recording the\nstatement that 'a suitable substitute from S.T. category is posted'. The respondents\nwere directed to give him six months salary only. \n.\nIt appears from the record, as well as, the Written Statement filed by\nthe Management that the post in question was reserved for SC/ST candidate. As\nper the advertisement, the petitioner was appointed for the respective years, subject\nto the approval from the Education Department, Zilla Parishad, Sindhudurg. The\nsaid appointment was purely temporary. As there was no candidate available,\nbelonging to the said reserved category, petitioner was appointed temporarily, on\nthe said post. The said process was continued for two years more. The\nrespondent's case is that as the candidate belonging to the reserved category were\nnot available or did not respond to the advertisement and, therefore, were left with\nno choice, but to appoint the petitioner on a temporary basis. The foundation of\nthe respondents cannot be overlooked as the post was meant for reserved\ncategories and this post was always subject to the approval from the Education\nDepartment. There is no dispute that the petitioner belongs to the open category.\nThe petitioner's entitlement to enjoy the post, in the circumstances, would be\nsubject to the non-availability of reserved category candidate or such other\ncandidate. The fact that he was appointed from time to time from the year 1984\nupto 1987-1988, by that itself, nowhere gives any right to such candidate to claim\npermanency, even after expiry of the alleged probation period, in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case.\n.\nIn this background and in view of the submission as raised and as\nreferred in the Written Statement, as well as, recorded by the Tribunal in paragraph\n, I am also of the view that now, at this stage, i.e. after more than 15 years, it is\ndifficult to accept the prayer of reinstatement. The finding given by the Tribunal is\nalso justified to maintain the order to the effect that 'unless the said post becomes\nde-reserved', a candidate appointed temporarily on such vacancy of ST/SC\ncategory would have only status of 'temporary' candidate.\n.\nA candidate from the open category cannot claim a right of\npermanency, on the said reserved post. There is nothing pointed out that such post\nbecomes de-reserved automatically after lapse of time or any other such things. In\nthe circumstances, appellant being open category candidate would have no right to\nhold the post meant for reserved category candidate. The `quota' or any action\nbased on the Reservation Policy cannot be disturbed without following the due\nprocedure of law. \n.\nIt needs to be mentioned here that if candidates belonging to the\nSC/ST category are not available, the petitioner's case may be considered by the\nManagement, if there is still a vacancy and/or the post is still required to be filled\nin. However, the Management is at liberty to consider this aspect, if a case is\nmade out on merit.\n.\nIn view of this observation, I decline to interfere with the finding\nrecorded by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, dated 27th October, 1989,\nhence termination is upheld.\n.\nThe Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of. No order as to costs.\nCertified copy expedited.\n [ANOOP V. MOHTA, J.]"

Hence, the present revision petition.\nThe brief facts of the case, as noticed by the Appellate Court \n in paras 2 to 4 of its judgment, are as under:-\nCriminal Revision No.661 of 1993\n 2. The brief facts relevant for the disposal of the present appeal\nare that Kamlesh Rani (PW4) wife of Vijay Kumar Malhotra is\nthe daughter of Krishna Devi sister of Darshan Lal complainant\nPW1. Kamlesh Rani has been residing at Panipat and has one son\nand one daughter.

Her son Manu\nwas playing in street. In the meantime at about 5.30 P.M.\nappellant came and lifted Manu in his lap and run away. Manu\ncried.

In this writ petition, on 20.12.1996, notice of motion was\nissued for 06.2.1997 and operation of Annexure P-5 (notice dated\n.11.1996) was stayed meanwhile. \nThe petitioners filed C.O.C.P.No. 65 of 1997 under Sections\nand 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 against Ram Kishan Gupta\nand Mange Ram for disobeying the order dated 20.12.1996 passed in\nC.W.P.No.19664 of 1996 titled Jai Parkash and others v. State of\nHaryana and others, on the ground that inspite of stay order dated\n.12.1996, both Ram Kishan Gupta and Mange Ram held meeting at the\nresidence of Ram Kishan Gupta on 29.12.1996, and passed a resolution\nregarding winding up of Dadri Education Society and its merger with\nDadri Educational Trust. \nThe contempt petition was contested by both the respondents\ntherein in which Ram Kishan Gupta had inter-alia pleaded that he\nremained admitted as an indoor patient in Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital,\nNew Delhi from 04.12.1996 to 28.12.1996 and was discharged on\n.12.1996, therefore, he had no knowledge of the stay order passed by this\nCourt. However, this plea was not accepted and vide order dated\n.9.1998, it was held that both the contemners were aware of the stay order\nand the meeting that had taken place had wilfully floated the order dated \n Civil Contempt Appeal No 19 of 1998 -3-\n.12.1996. They were,thus, held guilty of Contempt of Court and were\npunished for simple imprisonment for a term of three months' each and\nalso a fine of Rs.2000/- each and in default of making the payment of fine,\nthey were ordered to undergo imprisonment for another term of 15 days.\nIt was ordered that if the fine is recovered, the same shall be paid to the\npetitioners by way of compensation. The contempt petition was allowed\nwith costs which was assessed at Rs. 20,000/- to be shared by both the\nrespondents equally. \nBoth Ram Kishan Gupta and Mange Ram filed separate\nappeals under Sections 19 (1) of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971\nagainst the order dated 22.9.1998 passed by learned Single Judge, which\nwas registered as Civil Contempt Appeal No. 17 of 1998 titled as Mange\nRam v. Jai Parkash and others and Civil Contempt Appeal No.19 of\ntitled as Ram Kishan Gupta v. Jai Parkash and others. The appeals\nwere admitted on 29.4.1999. The judgment to the extent of awarding\nimprisonment and costs was stayed.\nWe have heard Mr.O.P.Goyal, Senior Advocate with Ms.Priya\nKhanna and Mr. R.A.Sheoran,Advocates, for the appellant(s) in both the\nappeals and Mr. Jaswant Jain,Advocate, for the respondents and have\nperused the record. \nAt the out-set, Mr. O.P. Goyal, learned Senior Counsel has\nsubmitted that his client Ram Kishan Gupta is an old man of 91 years of\nage and is a heart patient. He has further submitted that appellants hold\nthis Court and all other Courts established by law in the highest esteem.\nThe appellants also tendered unqualified apology and has purged the\ncontempt. Similar is the prayer made by Mr. R,A.Sheoran, counsel for the\n Civil Contempt Appeal No 19 of 1998 -4-\nother contemner Mange Ram.\n\nThough, we find that the contempt is made out , yet in view\nof the fact that the appellant Ram Kishan Gupta is 91 years of age, a\nheart patient and has purged the contempt, similarly appellant Mange Ram\nhas also purged the contempt, we deem it appropriate to set aside the\norder of sentence and reduce the amount of compensation to Rs.10,000/-\nonly in both the cases, to which counsel for the respondents has raised on\nobjection.\nWith above modification, both the appeals are hereby\npartly allowed and it is ordered that the sentence imposed upon the\nappellants by the learned Single Judge is of three months simple\nimprisonment, is set aside. But the appellants shall have to pay the fine\nas well as costs which is reduced to Rs.10000/- each in both the appeals\nto be shared by both the appellants equally.\n (Rakesh Kumar Jain) \n Judge. \nMarch 12,2008\n ( Mehtab S.Gill ) \nRR\n Judge"

It must be\nimmediately noticed that the suit for declaration as referred to in the\npreamble of the plaint is distinct from the way the prayer column is\ncouched in paragraph 12, where the declaration sought is that the\ncancellation of allotment of land made in favour of the plaintiffs' was\nvoid and for an injunction restraining the defendants from interfering\nwith the possession. The inconsistency could be reconciled only by the\nfact that admittedly the property was the subject of allotment in the\nyear 1961 under Nazool Land Transfer Rules, 1956 by the Deputy\nCommissioner (Collector) Sangrur on 15.06.1961 and the plaintiffs\nthemselves had made reference to the fact that this allotment had been\ncancelled subsequently on 13.07.1978. The plaintiff is contending that\nthis cancellation was void ab initio since the same has been passed\nagainst the principles of natural justice. The subsequent allotment\nmade in favour of the 2nd defendant was, therefore, contended to be not\nvalid and the plaintiffs had sought for restraint against them from\ninterfering with the plaintiffs' possession.\n.\nThe State remained ex parte and gave no reason as to how the\nproceedings were initiated for cancellation of allotment in the year 1978\nand how a fresh allotment was made in favour of the 2nd defendant. The\nCourts below, however, held that there was no proof that the property\nhad been even allotted in favour of the plaintiffs and that possession of\nthe property had been handed over to the plaintiffs. The Court also\nR.S.A. No.1559 of 1983\n-3-\nfound that there had been a cancellation of order of allotment and the\nplaintiff could not file a suit without challenging the cancellation itself.\nA mere characterization of the cancellation as void cannot be a ground\nfor upholding the claim for injunction against the defendant. The suit is\ncontested only by the legal representatives of the private respondents in\nwhose favour the subsequent allotment was made.\n.\nOn the basis of pleadings, the following substantial questions\nof law arise for consideration.\n(i) whether the Courts below were justified in dismissing the\nplaintiffs' suit rested on alleged allotment in favour of the\nplaintiffs by the State on 15.06.1961 on the ground that the\nallotment had not been proved when the action of the\nState or functionaries must be presumed to be valid as an\nofficial act unless there are valid grounds brought by the\nState to justify the cancellation of allotment?\n(ii) whether the alleged cancellation of allotment in favour of\nthe plaintiff purported to have been done on 13.07.1978\nlegal and void?\n(iii)whether the State is entitled to assign the property through\nan allotment in favour of the 2nd defendant?\n(iv) whether the allotment of the property in favour of the 2nd\ndefendant-Bhag Singh valid to entitle the allottee to\ndisplace the claim of the plaintiffs in respect of the\ndisputed property?\n.\nOn the first point of whether the allotment made in favour of\nthe plaintiffs made on 15.06.1961 could have been cancelled, I find that\neven the alleged letter of allotment is not produced before the Court.\nThe relevant Rules themselves show that transfer of Nazool Lands under\nRule 3 could be made to a Cooperative Society comprising of persons\nbelonging to Scheduled Castes family. Rule 9-A of Nazool Land Transfer\nRules of 1956 reads as follows:-\nR.S.A. No.1559 of 1983\n-4-\n 9(A)(i): The arrears of instalments due under these rules shall\nbe recoverable as arrears of land revenue.\n(ii) In case of Cooperative Society/individual member\nconsistently makes default in making payment of two\ninstalments of price of Nazool land, the Collector may review\nthe case and cancel the allotment of land to the cooperative\nsociety/individual member whereupon the land shall revert to\nGovernment.\n(iii) The cooperative society/individual member concerned\nmay file an appeal to the Commissioner against the Collector's\norder within sixty days of the date of that order, and the\nCommissioner's order passed in appeal shall be final. \n.\nIn this case, the cancellation of properties could have been\nmade for non-payment of installments. The Courts below have held\nthat there is no proof that the property had been even specifically\nallotted in favour of the plaintiffs. Admittedly, the transfer itself has\nnot been completed by a certificate of transfer. A mere allotment does\nnot grant a right to the property itself. It merely is the first stage of\nobtaining a right. If it does not fructify into a transfer deed in the\nmanner provided, then no vested right can ever obtain. Rule 11\nprescribes a mode of transfer, which is reproduced as under:-\n 11. Certificate of transfer:-\n(1) As soon as the last installment of price has been paid by\nthe Cooperative Societies or the individual member of the\nScheduled Caste, as the case may be, in whose favour the\ntransfer has been made under the Rules, the Collector shall\ngrant to it or him under his signatures and seal a certificate of\ntransfer of ownership in the revised Form 'B' appended to\nthese Rules. \n.\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court recently held in the judgment in\nGreater Mohali Area Development Authority and others Vs. Manju\nJain AIR 2010 SC 3817 that a merely letter of allotment itself cannot\nbe a basis for claiming title to the property. Rule 9-A, which we have\nextracted above again contains a provision for challenging an order of\nR.S.A. No.1559 of 1983\n-5-\ncancellation. The plaintiffs, who had taken notice of the cancellation\ncould not have merely treated the proceedings as void without resorting\nto the procedure prescribed under the Act. The plaintiffs' action for\ninjunction cannot lie and more so, when the plaintiffs have not been\nable to show their possession continuously in pursuance of their\nallotment.\n.\nThe questions of law raised are answered against the\nappellants/plaintiffs and the appeal is dismissed. \n(K.

JUSTICE T.P.S. MANN\nPresent :\nMr. Ishwar Lal, Advocate\nMr. Manish Deswal, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana\nT.P.S. MANN, J. (Oral)\nThe petitioner was tried for an offence under Section 379 of\nthe Indian Penal Code on the allegations that on 8.3.1991 at about 5.00\np.m. in the area of Bus Stand, Sadhaura, he committed theft of Rs.110/-\nby taking that amount out of the possession of complainant-Maha Singh.\nVide judgment and order dated 10/11.10.1995, Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Jagadhri convicted him for the aforementioned offence and\nsentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and to\npay a fine of Rs.500/-. Aggrieved of his conviction and sentence, the\npetitioner filed an appeal but the same was dismissed by Additional\nSessions Judge, Yamuna Nagar on 3.11.1997. Consequently, he was\ntaken into custody so as to serve the sentence imposed upon him. He\nthen filed the present revision in which he was granted the concession of\nCrl. Revision No. 1057 of 1997\n -2-\nbail on 10.12.1997.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has not challenged the\nconviction of the petitioner for the offence under Section 379 IPC.\nHowever, he has submitted that the occurrence in question had taken\nplace more than nineteen years earlier. The amount said to have been\nstolen by the petitioner was recovered from him when he was shown to\nhave been apprehended while running away from the spot. The\npetitioner is not a previous convict. He has already deposited the fine\nimposed upon him by the trial Court. Out of the sentence of one year,\nhe has served an actual period of one and a half months. Therefore, the\nsentence of imprisonment imposed upon the petitioner be reduced to\nthat already undergone by him.\nOn the other hand, learned State counsel has opposed the\nprayer made on behalf of the petitioner by submitting that the petitioner\nhad pushed the complainant while alighting from a bus at Bus Stand\nSadhaura and in the process took out Rs.110/- from the right pocket of\nthe pant worn by the complainant. He tried to run away from the spot\nbut was overpowered by the persons present there and the amount of\nRs.110/- was recovered from him. Therefore, he does not deserve any\nleniency in the matter of sentence.\nWhen the petitioner was heard by the trial Court on the\nquantum of sentence, he had stated that he had small children to support\nand was the only bread earner of the family. The petitioner has been\nCrl. Revision No. 1057 of 1997\n -3-\nfacing the agony of criminal prosecution since the month of March,\n. From the records, it is apparent that after being taken into\ncustody on 8.3.1991, the petitioner was released on bail on 9.3.1991.\nHe was again taken into custody on 3.11.1997 when his appeal against\nhis conviction and sentence was dismissed by the lower appellate Court.\nIt was only on 10.12.1997 that he was ordered to be released on bail.\nTaking into consideration the totality of the circumstances, the Court is\nof the view that no useful purpose would be served by sending the\npetitioner behind the bars, once again, for undergoing the remainder of\nhis sentence. Ends of justice would be amply met if the substantive\nsentence of the petitioner is reduced to that already undergone by him.\nResultantly, the conviction of the petitioner under Section\nIPC is upheld. His substantive sentence of imprisonment is reduced\nto that already undergone by him. \nExcept for the modification in the quantum of sentence of\nimprisonment to the extent as indicated above, the revision fails and is,\ntherefore, dismissed.\n( T.P.S.

PURI\nPresent : Mr. Gurinder Pal Singh, Advocate for the revisionist \n in both cases.\n Mr. Rajeev Sharma, Advocate for U.T.Chandigarh\n in both cases.\nK.C.PURI, J.\nBy this common order, I intend to dispose of Criminal\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nRevision No.134 of 1998 titled Mohan Chand Joshi vs. State\n( U.T.Chandigarh ) and Criminal Revision No.135 of 1998 titled\nMohan Chand Joshi vs. State ( U.T.Chandigarh ) , as both the\nrevisions arise from the same FIR and against the same accused.\nFor convenience, facts are being taken from Criminal Revision\nNo.134 of 1998.\nThese are two revision petitions against the judgment\ndated 18.12.1997 passed by Shri S.S.Lamba, Additional Sessions\nJudge, Chandigarh, who dismissed the appeal, while reducing the\nsentence of imprisonment awarded by the trial Court from two years\nrigorous imprisonment to one year rigorous imprisonment and by\nmaintaining the amount of fine as Rs.1000/-, whereas Shri\nJ.S.Khushdil, learned Judicial Magistrate Ist Class, Chandigarh vide\njudgment and order dated 17.5.1986 sentenced the revisionist to\nundergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of two years and to pay a\nfine of Rs.1000/- and in default of payment of fine to undergo\nrigorous impressment for three months holding him guilty under\nSection 409 of the Indian Penal Code (in short   the IPC). \nThe brief facts of the prosecution case are that on the\ncomplaint made by Chief Executive Officer, Haryana State\nFederation of Consumer Cooperative Whole Sale Stores,( in short  \nthe Federation) against the revisionist. It is alleged in the complaint\nthat revisionist was appointed as salesman in this Federation on\n.10.1973 and he took over the charge of the stocks of retail shop on\n.10.1973. The normal duties of a salesman were to receive goods\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nfrom the main godown through an indent duly signed by him and the\ngodown keeper after due checking and satisfaction and to sell the\nsame in retail at his shop at the rates and in accordance with the\npolicy approved by the Federation. After the close of the day, the\nrevisionist was required to prepare the sales summaries of the sales\nmade during the day and to hand over the sales proceeds of the day\nto the cashier of the Federation against receipt. He was also\nresponsible for stocking, selling custody and accountability of the\ngoods given to him by the Federation from time to time. The financial\ntransactions of the goods supplied to him and the sales duly made by\nhim were kept by the office of the Federation in a register called as\nStock Liability Register. The entries made in this register by the\noffice were also signed by the salesman in token of having accepted\nthe liability from time to time. The revisionist was also supposed to\nconducted physical verification in the presence of the salesman and\nthe list of goods physically verified is signed by the auditors as well\nas by the salesman in token of its correctness. According to physical\nverification report for the period ending 31.12.1975 the value of\ngoods in the custody of Mohan Chand, salesman, amounted to\nRs.88,119.53ps. This was taken as opening balance of stocks with\nthe salesman from 1.1.1976. The value of goods given to the sales\nfrom 1.1.1976 to 3.2.1976 as well as sales affected by him and the\namount deposited with the Federation. As per physical verification of\nthe stocks in the charge of revisionist for the period ending 30.6.1975\nand 31.12.1975 heavy shortages were found in the stocks entrusted\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nto him in the capacity of a salesman. The revisionist was therefore,\nasked to hand over the charge of his stocks to Ram Lal Godown\nKeeper and the same was handed over the charge of stocks worth\nRs.58,672-73ps to Ram Lal Storekeeper on 3.2.1976 whereas\naccording to the stock liability register, the value of goods in his\ncharge as on 3.2.1976 should have been Rs.67,397-20ps. There\nwas thus a shortage of stock duly entrusted to him in the capacity of\na salesman worth Rs.8724-47ps. which revisionist has embezzled.\nThe investigation of this case was conducted by SI Brij Lal, who took\ninto possession necessary documents and recorded the statements\nof the prosecution witnesses. After completion of necessary\ninvestigation, challan against the revisionist was presented in the trial\nCourt for trial. \nOn appearance of the accused in the Court, copies of the\ndocuments were supplied to the accused under rules. \nFinding a prima facie case, the accused was charge-\nsheeted under Section 409 IPC to which he pleaded not guilty and\nclaimed trial.\nIn order to establish its case, prosecution has examined\nVijay Kumar (PW-1), Sudama Mool Chandani (PW-2), Om Parkash\n(PW2/B), Jagdish Chander (PW-3), Ramesh Chander (PW-4),\nSubash Chander Jain (PW-5), K.N.Parshad (PW-6), Om Parkash\n(PW-7), Mohinder Singh (PW-8), SI Brij Lal (PW-9), SI Nana Ram\n(PW-10), K.K.Sharma (PW-11), Ram Lal (PW-12), Shri J.P.Gupta\n(PW-13), SI Sandel Singh (PW-14) and Nanak Singh (PW-15) and\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nthe evidence was closed by order of the Court as the prosecution\nfailed to conclude its entire evidence.\nAfter conclusion of the trial, the accused was examined\nunder Section 313 Cr.P.C., all the incriminating evidence was put to\nhim which he denied and pleaded his false implication. He has\nadmitted that he was working as Salesman. He has also admitted\nthat the goods were received from the CONFED Store through\nindent, and after that those were put on sale. He has admitted that\nthe entries were made by the storekeeper and his signatures were\nobtained. He has stated that the original liability register has been\nintentionally concealed by the prosecution, just to prosecute him. He\nhas stated that the signatures on the liability register were obtained\nunder pressure and undue influence. The accused has examined\nSher Singh as DW-1 and Suresh Kumar as DW-2 and then close his\ndefence evidence.\n The learned trial Court, after appraisal of the evidence,\nfound the accused guilty and sentenced him as narrated above. The\nrevisionist filed appeal against that judgment. The appellate Court on\nre-appraisal of the evidence did not find any merit in the appeal and\ndismissed the same, however, while reducing the sentence from two\nyears to one year only. \nStill dis-satisfied with the aforesaid judgments and orders\nthe accused/revisionist filed instant revision petition before this\nCourt.\nI have heard learned counsel for the revisionist and\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nlearned State counsel and have gone through the records of the\ncase. \nLearned counsel for the revisionist has submitted that\nprimary evidence of embezzlement is missing in the present case.\nThe liability register, which reflected all the entries in respect of\nissuance of articles to the salesman are incorporated in the liability\nregister. The original liability register has been withheld by the\nprosecution on the ground that there were cuttings in the entries in\nthat register. The new liability register was prepared. The signatures\nagainst the entries were taken by the Officers under the threat. Even\nsome of the entries do not bear the signatures of petitioner. Since the\nprimary evidence is missing and as such the prosecution has failed\nto prove the alleged embezzlement.\nI have considered the said submission and have gone\nthrough the records of the case.\nBoth the Courts below have thrashed this point and\nreached to the conclusion that preparation of new liability register\ndoes not create doubt on the prosecution version. Signatures of\nrevisionist appear on all the entries except one or two entries in\nrespect of issuance of articles. Even if, the entries, which did not\nbear the signatures of revisionist, ignored in that case also the\nembezzlement stood proved. Moreover, in this case, the primary\nevidence is not the liability register but the primary evidence is in the\nshape of issuance of indent for sale of articles by the petitioner, who\nhappened to be salesman at that time. The revisionist has failed to\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \ncount for the articles issued to him through indents and there were\nshortage, as observed by both the Courts below. So, no scope for\ninterference in the present revision petition is made out. \nThe learned counsel for the petitioner has further\nsubmitted that revisionist filed complaint against the other officers,\nwho have actually embezzled the amount. The learned Judicial\nMagistrate Ist Class, has not reached to the logical conclusion as\nprovided under Section 202 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The\nbig guns have been shielded to make the petitioner scape goat. \nI have carefully considered the said submission but do\nnot find any force in that submission. In case the Judicial Magistrate\nIst Class, has not taken the cognizance, the petitioner would have\nthe remedy by filing a private complaint but he has not done so.\nSo, now after so many years, the petitioner cannot grumbled over\nthe said matter.\nLearned counsel for the revisionist has further submitted\nthat some time the goods were taken by the higher officers on credit\nbasis. The petitioner being a small employee could not say no to the\nofficers and helm of the affair. \n Both the Courts below have not considered this aspect.\n I have carefully considered the said submission but do\nnot find force in that. The goods alleged to be given on credit\nalthough not proved but according to the petitioner itself the value of\nthe same is very less i.e Rs.800/-. Even if, some officers have\ntaken the goods on credit in that case, the petitioner was required to\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nissue the bills and get the signature of that officers. But, there is\nnothing in this case on the file. So, the above said argument is also\nwithout any substance.\nLearned counsel for the revisionist has further submitted\nthat the petitioner has been discriminated. According to the policy of\nthe department, the salesman was entitled to have a shortage of half\nmeter per every than of cloth. This concession is allowed to the\nemployee as the same extra cloth has to be given to the person, who\npurchased the same.\nThe said concession has been withheld in the case of\npetitioner regarding shortage on account of embezzlement.\nI have carefully considered the said submission but do\nnot find any merit in that submission.\nEven if, concession of shortage by half meter is allowed\nto the petitioner in that case also the huge shortage of articles would\nnot be accounted for. The shortage can be in respect of the clothes\nonly. So far as other items such as tyres are concerned there\ncannot be shortage in respect of those items. So, the petitioner\ncannot have benefit of the above said argument. \nLearned counsel for the revisionist has submitted that\nthere is overwriting in some of the indents, the benefit of the same\nhas not been given to the petitioner. \nI have carefully considered the said submission but do\nnot fine any merit in that submission.\nNo specific act of overwriting prejudicial to the petitioner\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \nhas been pointed out during the course of arguments. \nThe learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that\nin para-5 of the grounds of revision the petitioner has given the\ndetails in respect of shortage of value of Rs.82,686.58ps. against\nthe shortage of Rs.88,119.53ps if these six items are taken into\naccount, there is no shortage. \nI have carefully considered the said submission but do\nnot fine any merit in that submission.\nNo reasonable ground for arriving at the conclusion that\nshortage of the stock is counted for as detailed in para-5 of the\ngrounds of appeal. These figures have been made by the petitioner\nfor the first time in the revision petition, which cannot be looked into.\nThe trial Court has appreciated the evidence on the record of this\ncase minutely. The first Appellate Court reprised the said evidence\ncarefully and no scope is left for interference in the concurrent finding\nof both the Courts below proving guilt of the petitioner. \nConsequently, the conviction recorded by both the Courts\nbelow stand affirmed.\nSo far as quantum of sentence is concerned, the\nshortage relates to the period 1974-76 i.e. more than 33 years. The\npetitioner is facing the protracted trial since the year 1982 i.e. more\nthan 27 years. \nLearned counsel for the petitioner has stated at the bar\nthat the petitioner has undergone incarceration for a period of 70\ndays out of substantive sentence of one year. It would not be in the\nCrl. Revision No.134 of 1998 \ninterest of justice to send the revisionist to custody, who has been\nfacing the agony of trial for the last 27 years and had also undergone\nincarceration of 70 days. \nConsequently, the sentence is reduced to the already\nundergone by him. However, the sentence of fine under Section 409\nIPC is enhanced to Rs.3000/-. \nWith the above said modification in the sentence, the\nrevision petition stands disposed of. \nA copy of this judgment be sent to the trial Court for strict\ncompliance.\n\n( K.C.PURI )\n\n JUDGE \nSeptember 15, 2009\nsv"

Nos. 1663 and 1647 of 1997.\nFor the sake of convenience, the facts are being taken from F.A.O. No. 1663\nof 1997.\nBoth these appeals filed by the Pepsu Road Transport\nCorporation arising out of the common award passed by the learned Motor\nAccident Claims Tribunal, Faridkot in MACT cases Nos. 38 and 39 dated\n.10.1992.\nClaimant-respondents herein filed a claim petition under\nSection 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act claiming compensation on account\nof death of Sandhura Singh in a motor vehicular accident. \nThe precise facts of the case are that Sandhura Singh deceased\nand Gurdial Singh claimant in MACT case No. 39 dated 31.10.1992 were\ntravelling on scooter No. PCO 3454 on 9.5.1992. The scooter was driven by\nSh. Gurdial Singh whereas Sandhura Singh deceased was sitting on the\nC.R.No. 1663 of 1997\n[2]\npillion. When they reached near the service station of Karnail Singh in the\nrevenue estate of village Badhni Kalan a bus bearing registration No. PB-\nA-9254 belonging to Pepsu Road Transport Corporation Barnala Depot,\nwhich was being driven by Kewal Singh respondent No.6 herein rashly and\nnegligently came from the side of Barnala and without blowing horn struck\nagainst the scooter. The scooter was said to be driven on left side of the road\nand in the said accident both the driver and the pillion rider sustained\ninjuries. In the Civil Hospital, Moga Sh. Sandhura Singh succumbed to his\ninjuries whereas Gurdial Singh survived. The claimants in claim petition\nNo. MACT 38 dated 31.10.1992 claimed a sum of Rs. 8,05,000/- as\ncompensation on account of the death of Sandhura Singh whereas Gurdial\nSingh claimant in another case claimed Rs. 12,87,162/- on account of\ninjuries sustained in the accident. \nThe claim petition was contested by respondent Nos. 1 to 3\nbefore the Tribunal wherein a stand was taken that the accident occurred\ndue to the rash and negligent driving by Gurdial Singh scooter driver. It was\nfurther claimed that Sandhura Singh was not earning anything and that he\nwas a liability on the family. The quantum of compensation was also\nchallenged. It was also claimed that the bus was insured with respondent\nNo.4 i.e. Insurance Company. It was further pleaded that accident had\noccurred due to breaking of leaf ( road spring) which was unforeseen\ncircumstance. The insurance company disputed its liability to pay the\ncompensation primarily on the ground that the insurance policy was\ncancelled. \nOn the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed in\nclaim petition No. MACT 38 dated 31.10.1992 by the learned Tribunal :-\nC.R.No. 1663 of 1997\n[3]\n.\nWhether Sandhura Singh died because of the rash and\nnegligent driving of bus No. PB-11-A 9254 belonging to\nP.R.T.C. Barnala Depot by Kewal Singh respondent on\n.5.1992 at about 7:00 a.m.?OPP\n.\nWhether the claimants are the legal heirs/dependent of\nthe deceased? OPP \n.\nWhether this bus was insured with United India\nInsurance Company and the insurance policy was in\nforce on 9.5.1992 and further the said Insurance Policy\nwas enforceable against the United India Insurance\nCompany Ltd. Moga ? OPR 1 & 2.\n.\nTo what amount of compensation the claimants are\nentitled to, if so, from whom? OPP\n.\nRelief.\nThe following issues were framed in claim petition titled\nGurdial Singh Vs. P.R.T.C. by the learned Tribunal :-\n.\nWhether Gurdial Singh suffered personal injury on\n.5.1992 at about 7:00 a.m. on account of the rash and\nnegligent driving of bus No.PB-11-A-9254 belonging to\nP.R.T.C. Barnala Depot by Kewal Singh respondent ?\nOPP \n.\nTo what amount of compensation the claimant is entitled\nto, if so, from whom ? OPP \n.\nWhether the bus was insured with United India Insurance\nCompany and the Insurance Policy was in force on\nC.R.No. 1663 of 1997\n[4]\n.5.1992 and further the said insurance policy was\nenforceable against the United India Insurance Company\nLtd. Moga ? OPR 1 & 2.\n.\nRelief.\nThe learned Tribunal on issue No.1 came to the conclusion that\nthe accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Bus No. PB-\n-A-9254 belonging to P.R.T.C. Barnala Depot which was driven by\nKewal Singh respondent. This finding has been recorded on the basis of\nevidence led before the Tribunal especially in view of the fact that the stand\ntaken by the driver of the bus was that the leaf of the front wheel ( road\nspring) had broken earlier and was repaired temporarily, which was the\ncause of accident. Accordingly, the learned Tribunal came to the conclusion\nthat in such a situation, the bus should have been kept off the road till it was\nproperly repaired.\nOn issue No.2 the learned Tribunal has held that the claimants\nare the legal heirs of the deceased. \nOn issue No.3, the learned Tribunal came to the conclusion that\nthe bus was insured with the Insurance Company respondent No.4. It is\npertinent to mention here that against this very award the Insurance\nCompany had filed FAO No.1725 of 1997, which was disposed of on\n.12.1997. The insurance Company was absolved of its liability to pay the\ncompensation keeping in view the fact that civil suit filed by the appellant\nherein against the cancellation of insurance policy was dismissed. \nOn issue No. 4, the learned Tribunal was pleased to grant a sum\nof Rs. 3,26,000/- ( Rs. three lakh and twenty six thousand only) as\ncompensation to claimants in MACT case No.38 dated 31.10.1992 whereas\nC.R.No. 1663 of 1997\n[5]\nin MACT case No. 39 dated 31.10.1992 Gurdial Singh injured was granted\na sum of Rs. 1,25,000/- as compensation. The claimants were also held\nentitled to interest @ 12% per annum.\nIn the grounds of appeal the appellant had challenged the award\nprimarily on the ground that the accident had occurred due to the rash and\nnegligent driving of scooter driver and also on the ground that no\nindependent witnesses were examined. There is no force in this contention\nas the learned Tribunal on appreciation of evidence has come to the\nconclusion that the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent\ndriving by Kewal Singh while driving bus No.PB-11-A-9254. Sh. Gurdial\nSingh admittedly was an eye witness to the accident.\nIt was also claimed that the compensation granted was highly\nexcessive. There is no force in this contention also as Rs. 3,26,000/- ( Rs.\nthree lakh and twenty six thousand only) for an agriculturist, who was 32\nyears of age at the time of accident, cannot be said to be excessive.\nAccordingly, there is no merit in the present appeals, hence, the\nsame are dismissed.\nFebruary 7,2007 \n\n( VINOD K.

JUSTICE T.P.S. MANN\nPresent :\nMr. D.S. Malwai, Advocate as\nAmicus Curiae for the petitioner. \nMr. Rajiv Sharma, Advocate \nfor Union Territory, Chandigarh. \nT.P.S. MANN, J. (Oral)\nThe petitioner was tried for the offence punishable under\nSection 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food\nAdulteration Act on the allegations that on 13.6.1990, he was found in\npossession of about 500 bottles of sweetened carbonated water (orange)\nfor sale in village Darua and the sample drawn therefrom was found to\ncontain brominated vegetable oil, use of which was not permitted. Vide\njudgment and order dated 13.9.1994, learned Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nChandigarh convicted the petitioner for the aforementioned offence and\nsentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to\npay a fine of Rs.1,000/- and in default of payment of fine, to undergo\nfurther rigorous imprisonment for one month. The amount of fine was\npaid. \nAggrieved of his conviction and sentence, the petitioner filed\nCriminal Revision No.251 of 1997\n -2-\nan appeal but the same was dismissed by learned Additional Sessions\nJudge, Chandigarh on 1.3.1997 by maintaining his conviction and\nsentence. \nLearned counsel for the petitioner has not challenged the\nconviction of the petitioner. However, he has submitted that the sample\nwas drawn from the petitioner on 13.6.1990. After receipt of the report\nfrom the Chemical Examiner, the criminal proceedings were initiated\nagainst the petitioner in the month of October, 1990 when a criminal\ncomplaint was filed by the Food Inspector. Ever since then, the petitioner\nhas been facing the agony of criminal prosecution. The present revision\nhas remained pending in this Court for the last more than 13 years.\nConsequent upon the dismissal of his appeal by the lower appellate\nCourt, the petitioner was taken into custody on 1.3.1997 and it was only\non 18.3.1997 that he was granted the concession of bail during the\npendency of his revision. Therefore, the substantive sentence of the\npetitioner be reduced to that already undergone by him. \nLearned counsel representing the Union Territory of\nChandigarh has opposed the prayer made on behalf of the petitioner by\nsubmitting that as the sweetened carbonated water (orange) sold by the\npetitioner was found adulterated, therefore, the petitioner has rightly been\nsentenced to minimum imprisonment and fine and the same cannot be\nreduced. \nIn Parshadi V State of Haryana 2004(2) R.C.R. (Criminal)\n, the sentence of a similarly situated accused, who stood convicted\nunder Section 7 read with Section 16(1)(a)(i) of the Act was reduced to\nCriminal Revision No.251 of 1997\n -3-\nthat already undergone by him as he had been facing the trial for a period\nof fourteen years. However, his fine was enhanced. While doing so, the\nCourt relied upon a number of judgments, viz, Mahavir V. State through\nGovt. Food Inspector, 2000(4) RCR(Crl.) 208, Behari Lal V. State of\n(U.T.) Chandigarh, 2000(1) RCR(Crl.) 222, Des Raj V. The State of\nHaryana, 1996(1) RCR 689, Vijay Kumar V. The State of Haryana 1996\n(2) RCR(Crl.) 554 (P&H), Mohinder Singh V. State (Chandigarh\nAdministration), 1997(2) RCR(Crl.) 168 (P&H) and Satpal V. State of\nHaryana, 1997(4) RCR(Crl.) 15 (P&H).\nIn Narinder Kumar V. State of Haryana 2008(2) All India\nCriminal Law Reporter 288, this Court, once again, reduced the sentence\nof a similarly situated convict to that already undergone by him as the\noccurrence pertained to the year 1984. \nIt is a fact that the sword of criminal prosecution has\nremained hanging on the head of the petitioner for the last more than 20\nyears. The present revision has remained pending in this Court for more\nthan 13 years. Out of the sentence of six months imposed upon him, the\npetitioner has already undergone a period of three weeks. When the\npetitioner was heard by the trial Court on the quantum of sentence, he\nhad pleaded that he was a young person of 27 years of age and had a\nlong way to go. There is no material on the file that the petitioner is a\nprevious convict or that he is involved in any other crime. Keeping in view\nthe observations made by different High Courts in the aforementioned\njudgments, I am of the view that no useful purpose would be served by\nsending the petitioner behind the bars, once again, so as to undergo\nCriminal Revision No.251 of 1997\n -4-\nremainder of his sentence. Ends of justice would be amply met if the\nsubstantive sentence of the petitioner is reduced to that already\nundergone by him and at the same time enhancing the fine of Rs.1,000/-\nto Rs.10,000/-.\nResultantly, the conviction of the petitioner for the offence\nunder Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food\nAdulteration Act is maintained. His substantive sentence of imprisonment\nis reduced to that already undergone by him. The fine of Rs.1,000/- is\nenhanced to Rs.10,000/-. The enhanced amount of fine be deposited by\nthe petitioner with the trial Court within three months from today, failing\nwhich he shall be required to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three\nmonths.\nThe revision is, accordingly, disposed of.\n ( T.P.S.MANN )\nMay 27, 2010\n JUDGE\nsatish"

Revision No.295 of 1996.\nM.P.Lamburia, and other officials inspected the kiryana\nshop of Sardara Ram situated at bus stand Nangal\nSirohi. Sardara Ram was found in possession of kiryana\narticles like gur, pulses, sugar, zeera etc. The\nGovernment Food Inspector after disclosing his identity\nhad demanded a sample of 450 grams of Zeera for\nanalysis against payment. 2 Kgs of Zeera was kept in a\ntin for public sale.\n Notice in form VI for taking the sample of\nZeera was prepared. Food Inspector tried to serve notice\nthen accused refused to accept the same and ran away\nfrom the shop after giving push to the Food Inspector.\nThe Food Inspector and other officials are tried to catch\nhold of him but failed to apprehend him. \nAfter completing the necessary formalities,\ncomplaint was instituted.\nOn merits, revisionist was convicted under\nSection 16(1)( c) of the Act and was sentenced to undergo\nrigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine\nof Rs.1,000/-. In default of payment of fine, he shall\nfurther undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of\none month.\nFeeling dissatisfied with the judgment of the\nlearned Judicial Magisttrate, Ist Class, Mahendergarh,\nCrl. Revision No.295 of 1996.\nfirst appeal was preferred but the appeal was dismissed\nby the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Narnaul. \nLearned counsel for the revisionist argued that\noccurrence is dated 30.1.1988. At that time, revisionist\nwas 54 years old. Now he is aged 75 years. Revisionist is\nthe first offender. Impugned judgment is not challenged\non the point of conviction. The learned counsel requested\nthat a lenient view be taken on the point of sentence and\norder the revisionist to undergo imprisonment already\nundergone because the revisionist remained in custody\nabout one and a half month. \nMr. K.S.Godara, Deputy Advocate General,\nHaryana, for the respondent argued that there is no\ndispute that the revisionist is 75 years old. Occurrence\nwas in the month January, 1988. He raised no objection\nif lenient view is taken in the matter of sentence.\nEvidence on the file shows that Government\nFood Inspector along with other officials on 30.1.1988 at\nabout 5.30 P.M. had raided the Kiryana shop of the\nrevisionist. Revisionist was found in possession of 2 Kg\nof Zeera kept for public sale. Against payment,\nGovernment Food Inspector demanded 450 grams of\nZeera. Notice in From VI regarding taking of sample of\nZeera was prepared but without signing the same\nCrl. Revision No.295 of 1996.\nrevisionist had fled away from the spot after giving a\npush to the Food Inspector. In view of the evidence of\nthe officials, both the Courts below had rightly opined\nthe revisionist committed an offence punishable under\nSection 16(1) (c ) of the Act.\nAt the time of commission of crime, revisionist\nwas 54 years old. Now he is about 75 years. Occurrence\nis dated 30.1.1988. Revisionist remained in custody for\nabout one and a half month. Revisionist is to become a\nhard criminal if he is sent to jail to undergo\nimprisonment, as ordered by the trial Court. \nKeeping in view the nature of offence and\nantecedents of the revisionist, I take a lenient view and\norder the revisionist to undergo imprisonment already\nundergone and he is also ordered to pay a fine of\nRs.15000/-. Rs. 15,000/- is to be deposited before the trial\nCourt within two months. In case the revisionist fails to\npay the fine, the revision shall stand dismissed.\nWith this modification, on the point of\nsentence, revision being without merit is dismissed.\n.7.2009\n( JORA SINGH )\nAnoop\n JUDGE"

He has submitted that landlord was residing at a distant \nplace. For this reason, he could not depose before the Rent \nController at the time of affirmative evidence.

Civil Court Cases 458.\nLearned counsel for the respondent has opposed the \nplea. He submits that petitioner has merely delayed the matter. \nPetitioner was granted ample opportunity to lead evidence in \naffirmative. He is merely trying to fill up lacuna in the case.

He, however, tendered a copy of the rent \nnote which was taken on record by the trial court as mark  A . \nThereafter, evidence of the respondent was recorded. At the time \ncase came up for rebuttal evidence, petitioner made an effort to \nlead affirmative evidence. He examined one witness Ram Phal, an \nofficial from Food & Supply department. Instant application for \nleading additional evidence was moved thereafter. Trial court \nrejected the plea observing that petitioner was granted sufficient \nopportunity to lead his evidence in affirmative but he failed to do \nso. I find no infirmity with the order passed by the court below. \nThe judgment relied upon by counsel for the petitioner in Charan \nSingh case (supra) is not applicable to facts of this case. In any \ncase, petitioner has not been able to show that evidence could not \nproduced earlier despite due diligence. On the other hand, he was \ngranted 7 effective opportunities but he failed to adduce evidence. \nEviction petition has been pending before the Rent Controller for \nmore than a decade. There is no ground to interfere in revisional \njurisdiction of this court. Dismissed. \nMay 09, 2013\n(RAJAN GUPTA)\nAjay\nJUDGE"

JUSTICE JORA SINGH\nPresent:\nMr. B.S.Bhalla, Advocate, \nfor the petitioner.\nMr. M.L.Gulati, Advocate, for \nthe respondents.\n JORA SINGH,J.\n\nThis Criminal \n Revision was instituted by\nEmployees State Insurance Corporation to impugn the\njudgment dated 27.2.1996 rendered by Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Gurdaspur.\nComplaint under Section 85(g) of the Employees'\nState Insurance Act, 1948 ( hereinafter referred to as  the\nAct ) was instituted by \n Employees State Insurance\nCorporation through its Insurance Inspector/ Manager, Local\nOffice, Dhariwal, on the allegations that accused Rakesh\nKumar Ohri (Proprietor) was and continued to be the\nPrincipal Employer of M/S. Raman & Company (Rice Mill),\nAwankhe Gate, near D.A.V.School, Dina Nagar in terms of\nCrl. Revision No.388 of 1996.\nSection 2(17) of the Act and at the time of committing of\noffence was in-charge and was\nresponsible\n\nto\n\nthe\nestablishment for the superannuating of control of the\nbusiness of the establishment. The accused has failed to\nproduce the record, namely, wages/salaries registers,\ncontribution registers, return of contributions, registers of\nemployees' under Regulation 32 and other record pertaining\nto the payment of contributions, Inspection book, payment\nvouchers and ledgers and cash books for inspection before\nInsurance Inspector on 10.8.1993 and 22.9.1993 for the\nperiod from 1.7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards\nas required under Section 45 of the Act. Due to non-\nproduction of the record as mentioned above, accused has\ncommitted an offence punishable under Section 85(g) of the\nAct.\nAccused was summoned to face trial.\nNotice under Section 85(g) of the Act was issued.\nAccused pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. Accused moved\nan application dated 11.2.1995 for dropping the proceedings\non the allegation that complaint was instituted after the\nexpiry of period of limitation, as per Sections 468 and 204\nCr.P.C.\nNotice was issued to the complainant. Ultimately,\nlearned Chief Judicial Magistrate, opined that complaint is\nnot maintainable being time barred and was dismissed.\nFeeling dissatisfied with the order dated 27.2.1996\nthis revision petition was instituted.\nCrl. Revision No.388 of 1996.\nI have heard learned counsel for the parties.\nLearned counsel for the revisionist argued that\nmain complaint was presented on 10.11.1993. After\nsummoning, accused had appeared on 23.11.1994. Notice\nunder Section 85(g) of the Act was issued on 5.1.1995. Under\nthe Act, no limitation is provided. Maximum sentence under\nSection 85(g) of the Act is two years and to pay a fine of\nRs.500/-. Contribution is every month. Due to non-deposit of\ncontribution offence under Sectilon 85(g) is a continuing\noffence. Learned counsel for the revisionist cited ESIC Vs.\nC.C.Santhakumar, JT 2006(10) SC 549.\nLearned counsel for the respondent argued that as\nper Section 468 Cr.P.C. complaint was not within limitation.\nCourt has no power to take cognizance beyond the expiry of\nlimitation. Due to non-production of record, complaint should\nhave been filed within six months. As per the Act, question\nof limitation can be agitated at any stage even after\ncognizance is taken. In the present case, cognizance was\ntaken on 5.1.1995 when notice was issued.\nAs per allegation of the revisionist, respondent\nfailed to produce record pertaining to the payment of\ncontributions, inspection book, payment vouchers, ledgers\nand cash book etc for investigation for the period from\n.7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required\nunder Section 45 of the Act. Complaint was presented in the\nCourt of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur on\n.11.1993.\nCrl. Revision No.388 of 1996.\nNotice was issued to the accused to appear in the\nCourt. After appearance of the accused, on 23.11.1994, notice\nunder Section 85(g) was issued on 5.1.1995. Record is silent\nas to on which date application for dropping proceedings\nunder Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. were presented. \nDue to non-production of record, accused are liable\nfor the commission of offence punishable under Section 85(g)\nof the Act. \nSection 85(g) of the Act is reproduced as under:-\n (g) is guilty of any contravention of or non-\ncompliance with any of the requirements of this Act or the\nrules or the regulations in respect of which no special penalty\nis provided.\n( he shall be punishable \n(i)\nwhere the commits an offence under clause (a),\nwith imprisonment for a term which may extend\nto three years but-\n(a)\nwhich shall not be less than one year, in case\nof failure to pay the employee s contribution\nwhich has been deducted by him from the\nemployee s wages and shall also be liable to\nfine of ten thousand rupees;\n(b)\nwhich shall not be less than six months, in\nany other case and shall also be liable to fine\nof five thousand rupees.\nProvided that the Court may, or any\nadequate and special reason to be\nCrl. Revision No.388 of 1996.\nrecorded in the judgment, impose a\nsentence of imprisonment for a lesser\nterm.\n(ii)\nwhere he commits an offence under any of the\nclauses (b) to (g) (both inclusive), with\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to\none year or with fine which may extend to four\nthousand rupees, or with both.)\nIn E.S.I.C. v. C.C. Santhakumar, JT 2006 (10) SC\n, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as\nunder:-\n 21. It is clear, therefore, that the right\nof the Corporation to recover these amounts by\ncoercive process is not restricted by any limitation\nnor could be the Government by recourse to the\nrule-making power prescribed a period in the teeth\nof Section 68.\n. In the above judgment this Court has\nclearly held that Section 68 of the Act empowers\nthe Corporation to resort to coercive process, to\nrecover the contribution from the employer as if it\nwere an arrear of land revenue and the said right is\nnot restricted by any limitation. This is a crucial\nSection.\n. Similarly, no limitation is provided in\nChapter VII. It deals with the imposition of penalty\nor levy of damages upon failure to pay\nCrl. Revision No.388 of 1996.\ncontributions. It consists of Sections 84 to 86A.\n. When the Act itself does not provide\nfor any limitation on the Corporation right to claim,\nthe employers cannot rely upon Regulations 32 to\n, dealing with the period for maintenance of\nregisters, to imply any limitation.\n Gurdeep Singh Vs. State and others,\n(3) 289 was relied by the learned trial Court\nfor disposing of the application for dropping\nproceedings wherein it was held that:\n A.\n Delhi Police Act, 1978, Sections 93 and\nand 2 ( r)- Altercation took place inside the\nhouse   No offence under Section 93 made out-\nOffence under Section 93 is made out if accused\nused any street or public place for threatening,\nabusive or insulting words or behaviour with\nintend to provoke breach of peace.\nB. Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, Section 468-\nFraming and amendment of charge   Calendra\nfiled in Court under Sections 93/97 of Delhi Police\nAct- Magistrate after examining a witness changed\nthe charge to 448 I.P.C. after about 1-1/2 years-\nperiods of limitation for offence under Section 448\nI.P.C. is one year- under Section 468 Cr.P.C. charge\ncould not be framed after limitation.

Revision No.388 of 1996.\nFraming of charge after limitation- case pending\nbefore Court- Court framing charge after expiry of\nlimitation period prescribed for the offence- charge\ncould not be framed after limitation. \nBut the above cited authority relied by the learned\ntrial Court is not applicable to the facts of the\npresent case. In the above cited authority,\noccurrence had taken place on 22.9.1987. Qua the\nincident dated 22.9.1987 Calendra was presented\nunder Sections 93/97 of Delhi Police Act.\nIn view of all the discussed above, revision is\naccepted. \n Order dated 27.2.1996 rendered by CJM,\nGurdaspur is set aside. Parties are directed to appear before\nthe learned CJM, Gurdaspur on 18.8.2009 with a direction to\nthe learned CJM, Gurdaspur to proceed as per law.\nRecord of the trial Court is sent back.\n\n.7.2009\n( JORA SINGH )\nAnoop\n JUDGE"

A perusal of Section 2(g)(3) of the 1961 Act reveals that a\nperson or a Gram Panchayat claiming that land described as  Shamilat\nPatti  vests or does not vest in a Gram Panchayat, shall be required to\nCWP No.3422 of 1987\n -2-\nprove by a reference to the relevant revenue record that the land was or\nwas not used for benefit of the village community or part thereof, or for\ncommon purposes of the village.\nThe District Development and Panchayat Officer,\nRupnagar, exercising the powers of the Collector, has held that the\nGram Panchayat has failed to prove the ingredients of Section 2(g)(3)\nof the 1961 Act and dismissed the petition filed by the Gram\nPanchayat. The Joint Director, Panchayats, Punjab, exercising the\npowers of the 'Commissioner', has, however, reversed the order passed\nby the Collector but without recording any finding in terms of Section\n(g)(3) of the 1961 Act.\nCounsel for the parties agree, on instructions from their\nrespective parties, that the writ petition may be allowed, the impugned\norder may be set aside and the matter may be remitted to the Director\nPanchayats, Punjab, Chandigarh, to decide the appeal afresh and in\naccordance with law.\nIn view of agreement between counsel for the parties, the\nwrit petition is allowed, the impugned order dated 14.10.1986 is set\naside and the matter is remitted to the Director Panchayats, Punjab,\nChandigarh, to decide the appeal afresh and in accordance with law\nwithin three months of parties putting in appearance before him on\n.07.2013.\n The Director Panchayats, Punjab, Chandigarh, shall grant\nan opportunity to both parties to lead additional evidence so as to\nCWP No.3422 of 1987\n -3-\nadduce relevant revenue record to prove their respective pleas.\nDuring pendency of the appeal, parties shall maintain status\nquo with respect to ownership, possession and the nature of the land, in\ndispute.\n\n [ RAJIVE BHALLA ]\n\n JUDGE\n.05.2013\n\n [ REKHA MITTAL ]\nshamsher\n\n JUDGE"

The petitioner\nfiled purchase application under Section 18 of the Punjab Security of Land\nTenures Act, 1953 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act of 1953') for\npurchasing the said land. The Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, vide his\norder dated 5.7.1962, allowed the said application and permitted the\npetitioner to purchase the said land on payment of certain amount, which\nwas to be paid in six equal monthly instalments. The petitioner did not make\nany payment. However, it was alleged by him that he made certain payment\nin that regard to the General Power of Attorney of said Mahadev.\nThereafter, on 24.2.1975, the petitioner moved an application before the\nAssistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, for sanctioning of mutation of\nownership in his favour with regard to the said land, on the basis of the\naforesaid purchase order. The Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, vide\norder dated 11.7.1975 (Annexure P-1) allowed the application and\nsanctioned mutation of the said land in favour of the petitioner. Aggrieved\nagainst the said order, Nirupama Devi (respondent No.3 herein) filed an\nappeal before the Collector, Hisar, on the ground that no instalment with\nregard to payment of the aforesaid amount was paid to the land-owner,\nwhich the petitioner was required to deposit in the Government Treasury.\nThe said appeal filed by respondent No.3 was dismissed by the Collector,\nHisar, vide order dated 7.9.1976 (Annexure P-2). The said order was\nchallenged by respondent No.3 before the Commissioner, Hisar Division,\nCWP No. 4440 of 1986\n-3-\nHisar, who vide his order dated 12.3.1980 (Annexure P-3), after coming to\nthe conclusion that the payment of instalment was not made by the\npetitioner, made reference to the Financial Commissioner, Haryana, with the\nrecommendation to set aside the orders dated 11.7.1975 (Annexure P-1) and\n.9.1976 (Annexure P-2), passed by the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar,\nand the Collector, Hisar, respectively, and to remand the case to the\nAssistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar. Accordingly, the Financial\nCommissioner, Haryana, vide his order dated 5.12.1985 (Annexure P-4)\naccepted the said recommendation and remanded the matter.\nThough learned counsel for the petitioner is not present, but\nwith the assistance of learned counsel for the respondents, I have gone\nthrough the impugned orders. The Commissioner, Hisar Division, Hisar,\nwhile recommending to the Financial Commissioner for setting aside the\norder of sanctioning the mutation, has observed that as per Rule 23 (3) of\nthe Punjab Security of Land Tenures Rules, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as\n`the Rules'), the tenant, in whose favour an order to purchase the land is\npassed, is required to deposit the amount of instalment within 15 days,\neither in a Government treasury or a sub-treasury or to pay it to the\nAssistant Collector Ist Grade. Admittedly, in the instant case, the petitioner\nhas neither deposited any amount in a Government treasury or a sub-\ntreasury nor he has made any payment in the court of Assistant Collector Ist\nGrade. He only alleges that some amount was paid by him to the General\nPower of Attorney of Mahadev, the big land owner, which has been denied\nCWP No. 4440 of 1986\n-4-\nby the big land owner. In his order, the learned Commissioner has observed\nthat the petitioner has not paid the price of the land to the land owner in\nterms of the order dated 5.7.1962. His statement to the effect that he had\nbeen paying instalments to the Munshi of Mahadev, the big land owner,\ncannot be accepted, because he has not produced any receipt issued by him.\nIt has been further held that under Rule 23 (3) of the Rules, the amount of\ninstalment fixed under Section 18 of the Act of 1953 could be deposited in\nthe Treasury within 15 days after the decision of the Assistant Collector. In\nthis regard, the learned Commissioner has relied upon a decision of the\nFinancial Commissioner, in Peman Ram v. Smt. Kheoni and others, 1963\nPLJ 35, wherein it was held that under Rule 23 (3) of the Rules, the tenant is\nrequired to deposit the compensation either in Government Treasury or Sub\nTreasury or to pay to the Assistant Collector Ist Grade having jurisdiction.\nDirect payment to the land owner has not been contemplated by the Rules. It\nhas been further held that a tenant, who disregards the Rules and takes the\nrisk of paying instalments to the land owner without getting a receipt, must\npay for the consequences of his folly. The subsequent payment deposited by\nthe tenant on 11.8.1973 was held to be illegal being time barred. Therefore,\nit was held that the Assistant Collector Ist Grade has committed grave\nillegality while sanctioning mutation of ownership in favour of the\npetitioner. The learned Financial Commissioner accepted the said\nrecommendation made by the learned Commissioner and thereafter, set\naside the orders dated 11.7.1975 (Annexure P-1) and 7.9.1976 (Annexure\nCWP No. 4440 of 1986\n-5-\nP-2), passed by the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, and the Collector,\nHisar, respectively, and remanded the case to the Assistant Collector Ist\nGrade, Hisar. I do not find any illegality in the said order and the same does\nnot require any interference by this Court under Article 226 of the\nConstitution of India.\nDismissed.\nNovember 09, 2010\n ( SATISH KUMAR MITTAL )\nndj\n JUDGE\nRefer to Reporter"

(Oral)\nThe instant criminal revision has been filed by Kesar\nSingh son of Hari Singh, resident of Kartar Pur, District Ropar.\nThe prosecution case is that on 9-5-1993 at about 11-00\na.m. in the area of bus stand Katani Kalan, the petitioner was driving\nBus No. CH-01G-5061 and due to his rash and negligent driving,\nwhile attempting to overtake a tempo, it ran over the same and hit an\nelectric pole and thereafter ran over one Maghi Ram, who was\nstanding on left side of the road, as a result of which the latter died. \nThe petitioner was convicted by the Judicial Magistrate\nst Class, Ludhiana and sentenced to RI for one year under Section\n-A IPC and a fine of Rs. 2,000/- and six months' RI under Section\nIPC. It was further ordered that non-payment of fine will entail\nhim with three months' RI. All the sentences were ordered to run\nconcurrently. \nThe petitioner filed appeal, which was also dismissed by\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge, Ludhiana. Hence he has come\nup in the present revision petition. \nSh. Nitin Kumar appearing for the petitioner has very fairly\nstated that since the witnesses have been believed by both the\nCourts below and they have returned the findings of fact, it would be\ndifficult for him to dislodge the testimony of the witnesses before a\nrevisional court.\nCriminal Revision No. 407 of 1998 (2)\nMaking an alternative prayer for reduction of sentence,\nMr. Nitin Kumar submits that the occurrence took place in May 1993.\nA period of 15 years has elapsed. The petitioner has suffered a\nprotracted trial. He was taken into custody on 18-4-1998 and was\nenlarged on bail on 20-5-1998 i.e. he has undergone one month and\ntwo days. \nTaking into consideration the totality of circumstances, I\nfind no justification in sending the petitioner behind bars once again\nafter 15 years. The sentence awarded by the trial Court is reduced\nto the period already undergone by the petitioner, subject to payment\nof fine of Rs.25,000/-, which ( if realised) shall be disbursed to the\nlegal heirs of deceased Maghi Ram. The amount of fine shall be\ndeposited before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ludhiana within three\nmonths from today. \nIn case of failure to deposit the amount of fine, the\npresent revision shall be deemed to have been dismissed and the\npetitioner shall undergo the remnant sentence, as awarded by the\ntrial Court. \nWith the aforesaid modification in the sentence, the\nrevision petition stands disposed of. \n\n[Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia]\n\n Judge \nJanuary 23, 2008. \n `ask'"

No. 11344 of 1994.\nNo. 2-workman was taken back in service, vide order dated 24.09.1994.

However, counsel for the petitioner-management\ncontends that full back wages should have been granted to the respondent\nNo.2-workman from the date of his retrenchment as the same was held not in\nconsonance with the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act. \nOn the other hand, counsel for the respondent No. 2-workman\nsubmits that since the provisions as contained in Section 25-N of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act have not been complied with, therefore, the\nrespondent No.2-workman is held entitled to reinstatement in service and\nhas been rightly granted by the Labour Court. \nI have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through the\nrecords of the case. It is a matter of fact which is admitted that the\nrespondent No. 2-workman was retrenched from service. The provisions as\ncontained in Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act were complied with\nbut since the provisions as contained in Section 25-N of the Industrial\nDisputes Act were applicable to the petitioner, the same having not been\ncomplied with, the retrenchment of the respondent No. 2-workman was not\nin consonance with the Industrial Disputes Act. In these peculiar facts and\ncircumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable that full back wages\nwhich have been granted to the respondent No. 2-workman by the Labour\n-2-\nC.W.P.

It would not be out of way to mention here\nthat since the services of the respondent No. 2-workman have been\nregularised, the question of reinstatement of respondent No. 2-workman is\nno more in question which would require adjudication by this Court.

The accused made a\ndisclosure statement and got recovered the country-made pistol. Amar\nSingh appeared as PW-2 and supported the version given by ASI\nDharamvir PW-3. In pursuance of the disclosure statement made, pistol\nEx.P1 and empties Ex.P2 to P4 were recovered on 8th March, 1995. The\ntrial Court had convicted the appellant for offence under Section 25 of the\nArms Act and had sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for\ntwo years. It was further ordered that the sentence shall run concurrent\nwith the sentence awarded to the accused under Section 307 IPC. \nThis Court had separately decided Criminal Appeal No.554-\nSB of 1997, wherein it was held that accused had fired shot at Balwan\nand had caused an injury which fall under Section 308 IPC and has\nCriminal Appeal No.557-SB of 1997\nsentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years. The\ntestimony of Amar Singh PW-2 and ASI Dharamvir PW-3 has been relied\nin the case under Section 308 IPC, where Amar Singh had appeared as\nPW-12 and ASI Dharamvir had appeared as PW-15. Therefore, once\nrecovery of weapon in pursuance of disclosure statement has been\nproved and it has been held by the Court that fire arm was used to cause\ninjury, there is no justification to substitute the well reasoned judgment of\nthe trial Court. However, as the trial Court had stated that the sentence\nawarded under Section 25 of the Arms Act shall run concurrent with the\nsentence awarded under Section 307 IPC, this Court acting as an\nappellate Court also affirms this finding and orders that sentence of two\nyears rigorous imprisonment awarded to the appellant under Section 25\nof the Arms Act shall run concurrent with the sentence of three years\nrigorous imprisonment awarded to him under Section 308 IPC. \nWith the observations made above, present appeal is\ndisposed of. \n[KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA]\nJUDGE\nth January, 2010\nrps"

KANNAN J.(ORAL)\n.\nThe challenge to the award of the Labour Court at the instance\nof the management namely Punjab State Tubewell Corporation Ltd. is\nmade on two counts: One, the purported reference that had been made\nwas without notice and therefore, the reference to the Labour Court was\nvitiated. Two, the workman had been terminated from service on\naccount of his being rendered surplus and being a junior most in the\ncadre that he belonged, he was required to be retrenched and notice of\nretrenchment was duly issued under Section 25-F of the Industrial\nDisputes Act and compensation was also paid to him which he had\nreceived. There had been a perfect statutory compliance and therefore,\nthe award of the Labour Court finding the termination to be illegal was\nunjustified. The management, therefore, seeks for quashing of order.\nC.W.P No.13635 of 1993\n-2-\n.\nLearned counsel appearing for the workman submits that he\nhad been appointed on work-charged basis for projects undertaken at\nvarious divisions as a Mate on 01.02.1978 and later was promoted and\nposted as Work Mistry on 01.10.1979. He had continued his services in\nsuch a post till the management passed order dated 04.05.1988. He had\nbeen ordered to be reverted from his designated post as Work Mistry to\nlower rank Chowkidar (Mate). Within five days, on 10.05.1988, a\nnotice of retrenchment had been served and on 06.06.1988, the\nretrenchment compensation had been given and received by the\nworkman.\n.\nThe challenge to retrenchment came immediately thereafter\nwhen a demand notice had been issued on 29.06.1998 and the\nproceedings were before the Labour Court on a reference from the\nGovernment. \n.\nOn the objection that the reference itself was bad, the Labour\nCourt had considered the fact that there was nothing on record to show\nconclusively that the management had not been heard before a reference\nwas finally made to the Court. It reasoned that in the absence of best\nevidence in the form of record of the Labour Commissioner, Punjab, it\nshould be taken that the management withheld from the Court vital\nevidences for the reasons best known to it and held the issue against the\nmanagement. I am not persuaded to take any different view on the\nlegality of the reference itself.\n.\nWhile considering the issue whether the retrenchment was\nvalid or not, the Labour Court had considered the fact that even the\norder of reversion purported to have been made on 04.05.1988, had been\nmade without any prior notice and even before the ink dried in the office\nC.W.P No.13635 of 1993\n-3-\norder, notice of termination was issued. The Labour Court had referred\nto the fact that the workman had stated on oath that notice of\nretrenchment was given on the same day when he was also informed that\nhe had been reverted. In matter of public employment, it is\ninconceivable that even if there was a decision for reversion, it could be\nmade without following the elementary principles of natural justice of\nserving notice on the workman to show cause against reversion. The\nreversion was just not a change in designation but it had serious\nconsequences of lower scale of pay. Again reversion cannot be a matter\nof mere administrative exigency with no formulation about how it could\nbe done without any reference to seniority. All that, we find from the\norder of reversion on 04.05.1988 was that he was senior in the lower\ncategory from which he was promoted. Actually, the juniormost\namongst the higher post alone could have been reverted and the\nreference must have been made with reference to his rank being the\njunior most from the post from which he was being reverted. Again the\norder of reversion refers to two other persons Balu Ram and Gurdev\nSingh also as having been reverted on the same day.\n.\nThe Labour Court has found that even amongst the persons,\nwho had been retained in the service after the so-called reversion, there\nwere persons who were lower in the order of seniority such as Piara Lal\ns/o Gurditta Ram (Sr. No.50) and several other persons who had been\nshown lower in the ranks as Chowkidars and they had been still in\nservice. Learned counsel appearing for the Corporation would find fault\nwith the reasoning adopted by the Labour Court by pointing out that the\npersons who had been retained in service had been inducted as\nChowkidars and the workman was a Mate who belonged to a different\nC.W.P No.13635 of 1993\n-4-\ncategory. Even in the order of reversion, the reference to the designation\nof the workman is stated to be only Chowkidar and the expression Mate\nis stated in parenthesis. Even in the seniority list, which had been\nproduced before the Labour Court, it is said to be only an extract of the\nseniority of Chowkidars and the extension which was sought to be\ngiven, was wrongly done. If only there was an official gradation that\nexisted that a Mate could not be accommodated as a Chowkidar, there\nwas no reason why a person who is senior amongst the workmen that\nwere in the same Class IV category should be jettisoned and persons\nwho were juniors to him should be retained in service. There was not\neven any evidence that there was any rational classification amongst the\nvarious categories of workmen amongst Class IV category. With no\nevidence coming from the management to explain with reference to the\nService Rules making differentiation in the classes of workers amongst\nthe same category, the Labour Court was justified in finding the\nreversion and the retrenchment to be illegal.\n.\nThe Labour Court has considered what was relevant and has\npassed the order directing reinstatement of the workman as Chowkidar\nwith continuity of service and back wages. I affirm the decision and\ndismiss the writ petition. No costs.\n(K. KANNAN)\n JUDGE\nJuly 15, 2009\nPankaj*"

      "death was rapid and between death and postmortem examination was about 24 to 36 hours. Criminal Appeal No.507 DB of 1998 Accused were arrested on 2.8.1996. During interrogation of accused Labha on 4.8.1996 blood stained datar was got recovered on the basis of his disclosure statement. After completion of investigation and necessary formalities accused were sent up for trial. Charge was framed against them under Section 302/34 and IPC on 30.4.1997 to which they did not plead guilty and claimed trial. At the trial, prosecution in order to prove its case examined Dr.Ashok Chanana (PW-1), Narinder Kumar (PW-2), Rajinder Mohan (PW-3) and Gurbhinder Singh ( PW-4). After the close of prosecution evidence accused, when examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C., prayed that they were innocent and have been falsely involved in this case. Learned trial Judge, Amritsar believed the prosecution version and held the accused guilty of the charge framed against them. Accused Labha was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.1,000/- under Section 302 IPC and rigorous imprisonment for three years with fine of Rs.500/- under Section 450 IPC. Accused Kuldip Singh @ Keepa was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.1,000/- under Section 302/34 IPC and rigorous imprisonment for three years with fine of Rs.500/- under Section 450 IPC. Hence, the present appeal. In appeal, it has been argued that it was a case of blind murder and the appellants had been falsely involved in this case. Criminal Appeal No.507 DB of 1998 The presence of five witnesses at the spot was doubtful. There was inordinate delay in lodging the FIR, which made the prosecution case untrustworthy. The names of the eye witnesses were not mentioned in the inquest report nor the weapon used was described therein. Learned State counsel, on the other hand, has submitted that the presence of the complainant could not be doubted at the spot being son of the deceased. The presence of the remaining witnesses can also not be doubted at the spot. There was no unexplained delay in lodging the FIR. Present case rests on an eye witness account. Complainant is the son of the deceased and his presence in the house i.e. place of occurrence cannot be doubted. Rajinder Mohan (PW-3) is the cousin brother of the complainant and his presence at the spot also cannot be doubted. Complainant, while appearing in witness box as PW-2, has deposed as per his statement in the FIR, which is duly corroborated by Rajinder Mohan (PW-3). Complainant woke up on hearing alarm raised by his father, whereas, Rajinder Mohan (PW-3) woke up on alarm raised by the complainant. Both the said witnesses witnessed the occurrence. The occurrence had allegedly taken place at about 10.30/11.00 a.m. and the matter was reported to the police in the morning. As per the Investigating Officer, the complainant had met him at about 7.30 a.m. on .7.1996 and, thereafter, he recorded his statement. After recording of the FIR, the special report was immediately sent to the Criminal Appeal No.507 DB of 1998 Magistrate, which was received by him at 11.15 a.m. The complainant must have been in a trauma and panic when he saw his father being murdered. Apparently it took some time for the complainant to report the matter to the police regarding murder of his father. The complainant has explained the delay that out of fear they did not move out anywhere at night and next day he along with Surjit Singh, Sarpanch of the village left to lodge the FIR. At this stage, it would be significant to examine the site plan Exhibit PJ. A perusal of the same reveals that dead body of Jiwan Dass was lying on a cot at Mark 'A' on the veranda, whereas, the complainant and eye witnesses were sleeping on the roof of the rooms opposite the veranda. An electric bulb was on at point 'E' near the place where the complainant and eye witnesses were sleeping. There is another aspect also. The complainant in his cross- examination deposed that roof of the house, where they were sleeping, could be 12 ft. high from the ground, whereas, roof of the house where his father was sleeping might be 9 ft. high. This appears plausible because generally roof of rooms is at a higher level than that of veranda A perusal of the site plan Ex. PJ as well as from the cross-examination of complainant it transpires that the occurrence could be witnessed by the eye witnesses from the place where they were sleeping and immediately it may not have been possible for them to rescue Jiwan Dass. It strengthens the prosecution case that the witnesses were present at the spot and Criminal Appeal No.507 DB of 1998 had witnessed the occurrence. The moment all the eye witnesses woke up and raised alarm, accused fled away from the spot. Admittedly, Jiwan Dass was sleeping at the time of occurrence. Injuries have been inflicted by accused Labha with the knife (datar) on the face of the deceased. The ocular version in this regard is duly corroborated by the medical evidence. Since the deceased was sleeping when the occurrence took place, he could not have offerred any resistance at that time and, as such, it was not necessary for any person to have held him from his legs. Rather this would have woken up the deceased before he was attacked. Apparently, the possibility that accused Kuldip Singh @ Keepa has been falsely involved in this case cannot be ruled out. Especially when there was no occasion for him to restrain a sleeping man. His presence at the spot is doubtful. However, so far as accused Labha is concerned, the statements of the witnesses qua his infliction of injuries on the person of the deceased are reliable and inspire confidence. The weapon used by accused Labha was recovered on the basis of his disclosure statement. As per the report of serologist knife was found to be stained with human blood. The fact that the names of the eye witnesses are not mentioned in the inquest report Exhibit PC is not material as Surjit Singh, Ex-Sarpanch and Samma Singh had merely identified the dead body, as per column No.4. It was not necessary for the Investigating Officer to have mentioned the names of all the other Criminal Appeal No.507 DB of 1998 persons in the said column. Moreover, the inquest report was prepared after the statement of the complainant was recorded, who had duly named the assailants in his statement. As such, the fact that dead body was not identified by the PWs' is not significant. In column No.12 of the inquest report it had been mentioned that the injuries had been caused with a sharp edged weapon. Merely because this weapon had not been specifically named in the said column does not damage the case of the prosecution which is otherwise duly established from the ocular and medical version qua appellant Labha. Even otherwise it is a settled law that any lapse committed by the Investigating Officer cannot be said to be fatal to the prosecution case if otherwise established. Although complainant has spelt out motive to commit the crime by the accused but in a case of eye witnesses account, motive looses its significance. After going through the entire evidence on record, we are of the opinion that the prosecution has been successful in proving its case against appellant Labha and his conviction and sentence are liable to be upheld. So far as appellant Kuldip Singh @ Keepa is concerned, he is liable to be acquitted by giving him benefit of doubt as possibility of his having been falsely involved in this case cannot be ruled out. Accordingly, this appeal is partly allowed. Appeal qua appellant No.1 Labha is dismissed and his conviction and sentence Criminal Appeal No.507 DB of 1998 under Section 302 and 450 IPC is maintained. Appeal qua appellant No.2 Kuldip Singh @ Keepa is allowed and he is acquitted of the charge framed against him. (SABINA) JUDGE (JASBIR SINGH) JUDGE September 01, 2008 anita"

About 10.30/11.00 p.m.\nCriminal Appeal No.507 DB of 1998\ncomplainant woke up on hearing alram raised by his father and saw\nthat Labha armed with datar was giving blows on the face of his\nfather while he was sleeping. Kuldip Singh @ Keepa was empty\nhanded and had held Jiwan Dass from his legs. Complainant raised\nhue and cry which woke up Surinder Kumar and Rajinder Mohan.\nLabha gave 4-5 datar blows on the face of Jiwan Dass. When they\nraised alarm accused fled away from the spot with their weapon.\nMotive behind occurrence is that accused used to purchase goods\nfrom their shop on credit and they had been abused by Jiwan Dass\non account of some payment. Due to this reason they had murdered\nhim in connivance with each other. Out of fear and trauma,\ncomplainant did not report the matter to the police during night. The\nmatter was reported to the police in the morning and statement of\ncomplainant was recorded at about 9.00 a.m. on 25.7.1996. On the\nbasis of the statement of the complainant formal FIR No. 116 dated\n.7.1996 was registered by the police of police station Lopoke. \nInspector Gurbhinder Singh visited the spot along with the\ncomplainant. The dead body of Jiwan Dass was recovered from the\ncot on the roof of the veranda. He prepared inquest report with\nregard to the recovered dead body and lifted blood stained earth\nfrom the spot and recorded statements of the witnesses. Rough site\nplan was prepared and the dead body was sent for post mortem\nexamination. Dr. Ashok Chanana conducted the post mortem\nexamination on the dead body of Jiwan Dass on 26.7.1996 at about\nCriminal Appeal No.507 DB of 1998\n.00 a.m. and found following injuries on the person of the\ndeceased:-\n. A horizontal incised wound 6 x 1.5 cm with clotted\nblood was present on the front of the nose in its middle.\nThe nose was divided into two portions. Clotted blood\nwas present at the site.\n. A horizontal incised wound 7 x 1.4 cm with clotted\nblood was present on the face, 3 cm below injury No.1.\n. An incised wound 1.6 x 2 cm was present from the\nright cheek upto the left ear. It passed through the\nupper lip. Clotted blood was present at the site. The\nmouth contained 50 ml. of fluid and clotted blood.\n. An incised wound obliquely placed 7x 1.4 cm with\nclotted blood was present on the left mandibular region.\nThe underlying mandible was fractured. Clotted blood\nwas present at the site.\n. An incised wound obliquely placed 3 x 1.2 cm with\nclotted blood was present on the back of left middle\nfinger.\nHe further opined that injuries were ante mortem in nature\nand cause of death was shock as a result of cumulative effect of\ninjuries which were sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of\nnature. The time between injuries and death was rapid and between\ndeath and postmortem examination was about 24 to 36 hours.\nCriminal Appeal No.507 DB of 1998\nAccused were arrested on 2.8.1996.

      "the father of the prosecutrix pertaining to some payment. However, no evidence was led by the accused in their defence. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. The prosecutrix, as per school certificate (Exhibit P.E), was born on 25.3.1983 and she had hardly attained the age of thirteen and a half years on the date of commission of the crime, it being 30.9.1996. No doubt, the age mentioned in the School Certificate is not the conclusive proof of age of the prosecutrix, but even after giving the benefit of error of judgment in forming opinion about the age of the prosecutrix, the age of the prosecutrix cannot be said to be more than fifteen -4- Criminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998. years. As noticed above, Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant), had approached the prosecutrix when she was alone in her house. She was escorted to Narwana by both the accused. The presence of the prosecutrix in the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh at Gohana cannot be denied because their presence was noticed in the Court premises and the local police at Gohana had sent a wireless message to Fatehabad police. The prosecutrix in her statement as P.W.9 has given the detailed account of the prosecution case including the manner in which she was enticed away from her house and the manner in which she was made to stay at Gohana in the house of the sister of appellant Rajbir Singh. Manjeet Kaur (P.W.10) is the mother of the prosecutrix and Balbir Singh (P.W.11) is the elder brother of the father of the prosecutrix, who were examined with regard to the age of the prosecutrix. N.C. Wadhwa (P.W.3) had brought the original register of admission and withdrawal of students in the Girls Senior Secondary School, Fatehabad and had produced the certificate (Exhibit P.E) showing the Date of Birth of the prosecutrix as .3.1983. Sub Inspector Partap Singh (P.W.4), who is Investigating Officer of the case, had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix (Exhibit P.G) when she had been recovered from the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh on 3.10.1996. Mr. A.K. Tyagi (P.W.13), who, at the relevant time, was posted as Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Fatehabad, had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 5.10.1996. As would be discussed -5- Criminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998. later on, the prosecutrix was not subjected to rape by appellant Rajbir Singh. Under the circumstances, the evidence furnished by the prosecutrix and the Investigating Officer leaves no room for doubt that the prosecutrix had been kidnapped by the accused from the lawful custody of her parents. The appellant Rajbir Singh has, thus, rightly been convicted and sentenced under Section 363 of the Code. The offence under Section 376 of the Code did not stand proved against the appellant in this case. In her statement (Exhibit P.G) recorded by the police immediately after her recovery from the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh on .10.1996, she did not state about the commission of rape on her by the appellant. She made improvement while making her statement before the Magistrate under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure wherein she stated that she had been raped by the appellant in his sister's house at Gohana. She had made statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate on 5.10.1996 i.e after two days of her recovery from the appellant and by that time she must be under the influence of her parents. The possibility of the prosecutrix being tutored by her parents while deposing before the Magistrate, is clearly evident. Dr. (Ms.) Ramesh Chakravarti (P.W.1), who had medico-legally examined the prosecutrix, did not observe any external marks of injuries on any part of the body of the prosecutrix including thighs and perineum. Besides, no semen was detected by the Forensic Science Laboratory on -6- Criminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998. the articles sent to it for examination. For the aforesaid reasons, the prosecution has been able to prove its case against the appellant under Section 363 of the Code beyond all reasonable doubts. I do not see any ground warranting interference in the impugned judgment of conviction and the sentence order rendered by the learned trial Judge. The same are hereby confirmed. Resultantly, this appeal is dismissed. January 27, 2010. ( MOHINDER PAL ) ak JUDGE"

JUSTICE MOHINDER PAL.\nPresent:\nMr. Amit Aggarwal, Advocate, \nfor Mr. Raghujeet Madan, Advocate,\nfor the appellant.\nMs. Sushma Chopra, Additional Advocate General, \nHaryana. \n\n-.-\nMOHINDER PAL, J.\nRajbir Singh (appellant) was tried by the Additional\nSessions Judge, Hisar, for the offences under Sections 363, 366-A\nand 376 of the Indian Penal Code (for short `the Code') whereas\n-2-\nCriminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998.\nhis co-accused Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant) was tried for\nthe offences under Sections 363, 366-A and 506 of the Code. The\nappellant and Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant) were convicted and\nsentenced under Section 363 of the Code vide judgment of\nconviction and the sentence order dated 24.7.1998 passed by the\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Hisar. The appellant was sentenced to\nundergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay fine of\nRs.200/-, in default whereof to undergo further simple imprisonment\nfor three months whereas Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant) was\nawarded the rigorous imprisonment for one and a half years and\nto pay fine of Rs.200/-, in default whereof to undergo simple\nimprisonment for three months for the said offence. In this appeal,\nappellant Rajbir Singh has impugned the said judgment of\nconviction and the sentence order. \nThe facts of the prosecution case are that the\nprosecutrix (name withheld) had been kidnapped from her house\nby Ramesh Kumar (co-accused of the appellant) on 30.9.1996\nwhen she was alone and her parents were not at home. The\nprosecutrix was reluctant to accompany Ramesh Kumar, but he\nshowed her a knife and extended threats to her. The prosecutrix\nthan accompanied Ramesh Kumar, who took her to Bus Stand of\nFatehabad where appellant Rajbir Singh met them. Both the\naccused then threatened the prosecutrix and made her to sit in\na bus bound for Narwana. After reaching Narwana, accused\nRamesh Kumar alighted from the bus. Thereafter, appellant Rajbir\nSingh took the prosecutrix to Gohana to his sister, namely, Smt.\n-3-\nCriminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998.\nSheela's house. Appellant Rajbir Singh forcibly committed rape\nupon the prosecutrix at night during her stay in the house of\nSmt.Sheela at Gohana. On the next day, they went to the Court\npremises for marriage, but the police rounded them on\n.10.1996. \nAfter presentation of challan in the Court, the accused\nwere put on trial for the offences as stated above.\nDuring trial, the prosecution examined as many as\nthirteen witnesses. \nIn their statements recorded under Section 313 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, accused-appellant Rajbir Singh and\nRamesh Kumar (non-appellant) denied the prosecution allegations\nand pleaded false implication on account of some altercation\nwhich took place between them and the father of the prosecutrix\npertaining to some payment. However, no evidence was led by the\naccused in their defence. \nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties and\nhave gone through the records of the case. \nThe prosecutrix, as per school certificate (Exhibit\nP.E), was born on 25.3.1983 and she had hardly attained\nthe age of thirteen and a half years on the date of commission\nof the crime, it being 30.9.1996. No doubt, the age mentioned\nin the School Certificate is not the conclusive proof of age of the\nprosecutrix, but even after giving the benefit of error of\njudgment in forming opinion about the age of the prosecutrix,\nthe age of the prosecutrix cannot be said to be more than fifteen\n-4-\nCriminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998.\nyears. As noticed above, Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant), had\napproached the prosecutrix when she was alone in her house.\nShe was escorted to Narwana by both the accused. The\npresence of the prosecutrix in the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh\nat Gohana cannot be denied because their presence was\nnoticed in the Court premises and the local police at Gohana\nhad sent a wireless message to Fatehabad police. The prosecutrix\nin her statement as P.W.9 has given the detailed account of the\nprosecution case including the manner in which she was enticed\naway from her house and the manner in which she was made to stay\nat Gohana in the house of the sister of appellant Rajbir Singh.\nManjeet Kaur (P.W.10) is the mother of the prosecutrix and\nBalbir Singh (P.W.11) is the elder brother of the father of the\nprosecutrix, who were examined with regard to the age of the\nprosecutrix. N.C. Wadhwa (P.W.3) had brought the original\nregister of admission and withdrawal of students in the Girls\nSenior Secondary School, Fatehabad and had produced the certificate\n(Exhibit P.E) showing the Date of Birth of the prosecutrix as\n.3.1983. Sub Inspector Partap Singh (P.W.4), who is\nInvestigating Officer of the case, had recorded the statement of\nthe prosecutrix (Exhibit P.G) when she had been recovered from\nthe custody of appellant Rajbir Singh on 3.10.1996. Mr. A.K.\nTyagi (P.W.13), who, at the relevant time, was posted as Sub\nDivisional Judicial Magistrate, Fatehabad, had recorded the\nstatement of the prosecutrix under Section 164 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure on 5.10.1996. As would be discussed\n-5-\nCriminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998.\nlater on, the prosecutrix was not subjected to rape by appellant\nRajbir Singh. Under the circumstances, the evidence furnished\nby the prosecutrix and the Investigating Officer leaves no room\nfor doubt that the prosecutrix had been kidnapped by the\naccused from the lawful custody of her parents. The appellant\nRajbir Singh has, thus, rightly been convicted and sentenced\nunder Section 363 of the Code.\nThe offence under Section 376 of the Code did not\nstand proved against the appellant in this case. In her\nstatement (Exhibit P.G) recorded by the police immediately\nafter her recovery from the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh on\n.10.1996, she did not state about the commission of rape on\nher by the appellant. She made improvement while making\nher statement before the Magistrate under Section 164 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure wherein she stated that she had been\nraped by the appellant in his sister's house at Gohana. She had\nmade statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure before the Magistrate on 5.10.1996 i.e after two days of\nher recovery from the appellant and by that time she must be\nunder the influence of her parents. The possibility of the\nprosecutrix being tutored by her parents while deposing before the\nMagistrate, is clearly evident. Dr. (Ms.) Ramesh Chakravarti\n(P.W.1), who had medico-legally examined the prosecutrix, did\nnot observe any external marks of injuries on any part of the\nbody of the prosecutrix including thighs and perineum. Besides,\nno semen was detected by the Forensic Science Laboratory on\n-6-\nCriminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998.\nthe articles sent to it for examination. \nFor the aforesaid reasons, the prosecution has been able\nto prove its case against the appellant under Section 363 of the\nCode beyond all reasonable doubts. I do not see any ground\nwarranting interference in the impugned judgment of conviction and\nthe sentence order rendered by the learned trial Judge. The same\nare hereby confirmed. Resultantly, this appeal is dismissed. \n\nJanuary 27, 2010.\n\n ( MOHINDER PAL )\nak\n JUDGE"

Hence, the present appeal by the accused-\nappellant.\nProsecution case, as noticed by the trial Court in paras No. 2\nCriminal Appeal No. 683-SB of 1998\n-2-\nand 3 of its judgment, is reproduced herein below:-\n 2. On 19.1.1996 ASI Babu Ram (PW4) was investigating one\ncase FIR No. 88 dated 15.12.1995, under sections 302/395,\n/120-B, 216A/148 read with Section 149 IPC, u/s 25 of the\nArms Act and 3/4/5 Explosive Substances Act of Police Station\nNangal. One Jagtar Singh who was accused in that case told ASI\nBabu Ram that he had handed over 5 Kgs of RDX to accused Sher\nSingh Granthi in order to conceal the same. ASI Babu Ram, HC\nBhupinder Singh, HC Randhir Singh constable Ram Phal and\nconstable Randhir Singh proceeded towards the house of accused\nSher Singh. When they reached near Manji Sahib Gurudwara\nSohan Lal (PW8) met them and he was joined in the raiding party.\nThe police party reached at the house of accused Sher Singh,\nsituated in Charkhi Mohalla, Ambala City. Accused Sher Singh\nwas available at his house. He was interrogated. Accused Sher\nSingh made a disclosure statement Ex.PD that about 1  months\nago Jagtar Singh alias Jassa had handed over 5 kgs of RDX to him\nfor the purpose of concealing and he had kept the same concealed\nin a trunk lying in the eastern room of his residential house and he\ncould get the same recovered. He also stated that Jagtar Singh,\nParamjit Singh Bhewar, Balwant Singh and Parshotam Singh used\nto visit him in Sangat Sahib Gurudwara and they used to talk of\ncausing the death of Shri Bhajan Lal Chief Minister, Haryana by\nbomb explosion Jagtar Singh alias Jassa, Paramjit Singh and\nBalwant Singh also told him that they had conspired and had\ncaused the death of Shri Beant Singh, Chief Minister, Punjab in a\nCriminal Appeal No. 683-SB of 1998\n-3-\nbomb blast.\n.

      "that of the prosecutrix was having a height of three feet. Sunil Kumar Bhatnagar, Draftsman PW-11 had prepared the scaled site plan of the spot Ex.PO. Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix was given up as won-over. The Public Prosecutor had placed on record report Ex.PK of the Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban, Haryana, wherein it was stated that human semen was detected on multicoloured terrycot Salwar and on yellow/brown nylon underwear. Thereafter, prosecution closed its evidence. Statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating circumstances were put to him. He denied the same and projected the following version in his statement: Yes. I am innocent. I have been falsely implicated in this case only to save Bansi s/o Sube Singh who is friend and Guru of the husband of the prosecutrix in motor driving, as there was case against him under Section 377 IPC and in charge of P.S. Sahalwas Jagdish Chander was relative of my village and interested in compromise in the case under Section 377 IPC. Both parties were apprehended from the village on the same day but they were sent to home in evening and I was kept in Thana more than 5 and 6 days. In defence, Jagminder Singh Draftsman was examined as DW-1. He proved the site plan Ex.D1. This witness stated that the door of the house of accused faces the street towards the Northern side of his house. Thereafter, there is a small turning at the northern-western corner of the house of accused and thereafter, the street goes to the door of the house of prosecutrix. Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 Mauji Ram DW-2 stated that as a Sarpanch, he had not heard of any incident. This witness stated that it was not in his knowledge that the accused and cousin of Nahnu Ram were challaned under Section /151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had only heard about a family dispute. Het Ram DW-3 stated that he had learnt that Taqdir had been challaned under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had heard nothing about the accused. In cross examination, this witness stated that there was no case registered against the accused under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. Sabha Chand Chaukidar DW-4 stated that the circumstances regarding arrest of the accused were not in his knowledge. I have heard counsel for the parties. Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate appearing for the appellant, has stated that the prosecutrix was aged about 19-20 years. It is further submitted that at the time of incident, prosecutrix was 21 weeks pregnant. It is submitted that according to the prosecution story, accused came to the house of the prosecutrix at 11.00 p.m. He had tied the hands of the prosecutrix with a cloth and had allegedly gagged her mouth with the cloth. It is contended that according to the prosecutrix, the accused while leaving, had untied her hands and had removed the cloth from her mouth, still the prosecutrix had raised no noise to attract anybody and narrate the incident. These circumstances according to the counsel, make the version projected by the prosecutrix unnatural, improbable and unconvincing. It is urged that this Court should appreciate the arguments in light of the fact that for four days, the prosecutrix had not reported the matter to the police. The occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, 1996, whereas, the report was lodged with the police on 7th May, 1996. Counsel has further stated that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles and ring of little finger were broken at the spot Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 and the same were taken into possession by the Investigating Officer. This fact was also reiterated by Nahna Ram PW-5, husband of the prosecutrix. But ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 had stated in categoric terms that no bangles were taken into possession and the same were not found at the spot. This according to the counsel, is a material contradiction between the testimony of three prime witnesses examined by the prosecution. Furthermore, it was averred that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles had caused injuries on her arms but no such injury was found in the medico legal report, therefore, the medical evidence in no way corroborates the ocular version. It is submitted that vaginal swabs were sent to the laboratory but no semen was found. There were no external or internal marks of injury suffered by the prosecutrix. It is further submitted that Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, to whom the occurrence was narrated for the first time, was not examined by the prosecution. Even brother of husband of the prosecutrix, who had relayed the information to Nahnu Ram, husband of the prosecutrix, at the place of his avocation, was not examined. Adding force to the above stated arguments, it is urged that the suggestions given by the accused and the version narrated by him in his statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. assumes importance, as present and the former Sarpanch of the village had appeared in defence as DW-2 and DW-3 respectively and stated that no occurrence had taken place. This according to the counsel, belies the explanation furnished by the prosecutrix to explain the delay that the villagers had prompted her to lodge the report so that the culprit should be punished. Counsel for the State has urged that the testimony of prosecutrix aspires confidence and can be relied upon without any corroboration. Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 There are certain features of this case, which compel this Court to arrive at a conclusion that the testimony of the prosecutrix can be relied upon without any corroboration: (a) Father of the accused and the father of husband of the prosecutrix were brothers, therefore, the accused and husband of the prosecutrix are closely related. (b) On the day of occurrence, in connection with his avocation, husband of the prosecutrix had gone out of the village and the prosecutrix was alone at her house when in the night accused had trespassed into her house. (c) The version projected regarding the alleged inimical relations has not been proved by the defence. No copy of the FIR, report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. or the Court proceedings has been placed on record to prove that the alleged friend (Ustad) of husband of the prosecutrix was involved in a case under Section 377 Cr.P.C. Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that the prosecutrix and her husband will level false allegations of rape to absolve a friend of the husband, especially when the accused is closely related to them. Thus, except a bald suggestion and a version under Section Cr.P.C., nothing has been brought on record to corroborate the same. The suggestion propounded by the defence and the version given under Section 313 Cr.P.C. are to be rejected, being not probable. Once this Court has held that the relations between the parties were normal, then it is difficult to believe that the Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 prosecutrix will put reputation of her family at stake by leveling false allegations. (d) It is not the case of the accused that it is a case of consent. The arguments raised by the defence counsel that there was a delay of four days in lodging the report to the police; no injury on the person of the prosecutrix was found in the medical evidence, therefore, she had not offered any resistance; the bangles were not recovered and that the defence witnesses have belied the version of the prosecutrix, are to be rejected in the context of circumstances enumerated above. The Hon ble Apex Court, in State of Maharasthra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550, observed as under: 15. It is necessary at the outset to state what the approach of the court should be while evaluating the prosecution evidence, particularly the evidence of the prosecutrix, in sex offences. Is it essential that the evidence of the prosecutrix should be corroborated in material particulars before the court bases a conviction on her testimony ? Does the rule of prudence demand that in all cases save the rarest of rare the court should look for corroboration before acting on the evidence of the prosecutrix ? Let us see if the Evidence Act provides the clue. Under the said statute Evidence means and includes all statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to the matters of fact under inquiry. Under Section 59 all facts, except the contents of documents, may be proved by oral evidence. Section 118 then tells us who may give oral evidence. According to that section all persons are competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rational answers to those questions, by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind. Even in the case of an accomplice Section Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 provides that he shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. However, illustration (b) to Section 114, which lays down a rule of practice, says that the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is corroborated in material particulars. Thus under Section 133, which lays down a rule of law, an accomplice is a competent witness and a conviction based solely on his uncorroborated evidence is not illegal although in view of Section 114, illustration (b), courts do not as a matter of practice do so and look for corroboration in material particulars. This is the conjoint effect of Sections 133 and 114, illustration (b). . A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to illustration (b) to Section 114 which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no doubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix who does not lack understanding must be accepted. The degree of proof required must not be higher than is expected of an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that exception has rightly been taken to the approach of the High Court as is reflected in the following passage: It is only in the rarest of rare cases if the court finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is so trustworthy, truthful and reliable that other corroboration may not be necessary. With respect, the law is not correctly stated. If we may say so, it is just the reverse. Ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an injured person who is a victim of violence, unless there are special circumstances which call for greater caution, in which case it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is independent evidence lending assurance to her accusation. . We think it proper, having regard to the increase in the number of sex violation cases in the recent past, particularly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to remove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman who is a victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be corroborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare cases. To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare cases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust of another with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult womanhood. It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman that her story of woe will not be believed unless it is corroborated in material particulars as in the case of an accomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where it concerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society as in some of the western and European countries. Our Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 standard of decency and morality in public life is not the same as in those countries. It is, however, unfortunate that respect for womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases of molestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman is now required to suffer indignities in different forms, from lewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape. Decency and morality in public life can be promoted and protected only if we deal strictly with those who violate the societal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the court in such cases must take into account the fact that such crimes are generally committed on the sly and very rarely direct evidence of a person other than the prosecutrix is available. Courts must also realise that ordinarily a woman, more so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling a false charge concerning her chastity. In the light of the observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court above, this Court cannot ignore that on the Salwar and underwear of the prosecutrix, human semen was detected. It is not necessary that in every case, vaginal swabs must contain semen. Sometimes the accused may discharge the semen outside the vagina. No question to this effect was asked to the prosecutrix. Furthermore, it was stated by the prosecutrix that her hands were tied and her legs were weak, therefore, she could not offer resistance to the accused, who was a well built young man. Non- examination of Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, and elder brother (cousin) (Jeth) of husband of the prosecutrix, is also of no consequence as the testimony of the prosecutrix corroborated by her husband is sufficient for reliance, as the same aspires confidence. In Gita Ram v. State of H.P. 2002 Cri.L.J.3832, Himachal Pradesh High Court has held that the delay in lodging of the report is of no consequence as victim of sexual assault face a lot of difficulty to come forward to depose against the accused, as the reputation of family of the prosecutrix is at stake. Relying upon the judgment rendered in State of Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 Punjab v. Gurmit Singh (1996) 2 SCC 384, Himachal Pradesh High Court observed as under: 22. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh , (1996) 2 SCC : (1996 Cri LJ 1728), their Lordships took note of the existing rate of crime against women and held : (SCC p 403, para 21) : (at Pp 1739-40, Para 20 of Cri LJ). 21. Of late, crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the society towards the violation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must remember that a rapist not only violate the victim's privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female. The Courts, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If for some reason the Court finds it different to place implicit reliance on her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the trial Court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations. Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 Referring to an earlier judgment in State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550 : (1990 Cri LJ 889), the Supreme Court in Gurmit Singh case (1996 (2) SCC 384 : 1996 Cri LJ 1728) held : (SCC Pp 395- , paras 8-9) : (at p 1735, Para 7 of Cri LJ). The Courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self respecting woman would come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. The inherent bashfulness of the females and the tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are factors which the Courts should not overlook. The testimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the Courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion ? The Court while appreciating the evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is a witness who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to insist upon corroboration of her statement to base conviction of an accused. The evidence of a victim of Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 sexual assault stands almost on a par with the evidence of a injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable. Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which is not found to be self inflicted, as considered to be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield the real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding. Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. It must not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person s lust and it is improper and undesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount of suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice. Interference have to be drawn from a given set of facts and circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead uniformity lest that type of rigidity in the shape of rule of law is introduced through a new form of testimonial tyranny making justice a casualty. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even, if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as deprobable. In State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990 (1) SCC 550 : 1990 Cri LJ 889), Ahmadi, J. (as the Lord Chief Justice then was) speaking for the Bench summarised the position in the following words : (SCC p 559, para 16 : (at Pp 894-95, Para 16 of Cri LJ). A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on a par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care of and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to Illustration (b) to Section 114 which required it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the Court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the Court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the Court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We are in respectful agreement with the above exposition of law. In the instant case our careful analysis of the statement of the prosecutrix has created an impression on our minds that she is a reliable and truthful witness. Her testimony suffers from no infirmity or blemish whatsoever. We have no hesitation in acting upon her testimony alone without looking for any corroboration. However, in this case there is Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix. . In the light of the above said ratio of the decision of the Apex Court, I find that in the case on hand the testimony of the prosecutrix discussed hereinabove suffers from no infirmity and she is a reliable and truthful witness. There is ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix in the form of the deposition of PW 2 to whom the prosecutrix had narrated the incident in the evening on the same day and she disclosed the occurrence to her husband immediately after he returned from attending the fair. Medical evidence is not of much relevance for the reason that prosecutrix was examined by Dr. Shyam after about 24 days from the alleged day of occurrence and further because she is a married woman and was habitual of sexual inter course. In the present case, the prosecutrix was medico legally examined after four days of the occurrence. In Karnel Singh v. State of M.P. 1995(3) RCR (Criminal) , it was observed as under: 7. The submission overlooks the fact that in India women are slow and hesitant to complain of such assaults and if the prosecutrix happens to be a married person she will not do anything without informing her husband. Merely because the complaint was lodged less than promptly does not raise the inference that the complaint was false. The reluctance to go to the police is because of society s attitude towards such women; it casts doubt and shame upon her rather than comfort and sympathize with her. Therefore, delay in lodging complaints in such cases does not necessarily indicate that her version is false. In view of the observations of the Hon ble Apex Court, it is necessary to notice the judgments relied by the counsel for the appellant. Reliance has been placed upon Tameezuddin @ Tammu v. State of Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 (NCT) of Delhi 2009(4) RCR (Criminal) 345. A perusal of the said judgment reveals that the same is not attracted on the facts of the present case. Their Lordships of Hon ble Apex Court took into consideration the testimony of PW-1 prosecutrix where she told the appellant that everything was forgiven and forgotten. Another judgment relied by the counsel for the appellant rendered in State of Haryana v. Dilawar 2009(3) RCR (Criminal) 2001 is also not attracted, as the Court has given credence to the fact that Zile Singh PW-6 in that case had not supported the prosecution. Similarly Kishan v. State of Haryana 2009(3) RCR (Criminal) 480, a judgment rendered by a Single Bench of this Court is also not attracted on the facts of the present case, as it was held that the evidence of the prosecutrix was neither reliable nor trustworthy. It was further held that each case depends on its own facts and circumstances. Another judgment cited by counsel for the appellant, rendered by a Division Bench of Hon ble Apex Court in Pandurang Sitaram Bhagwat v. State of Maharashtra 2005(1) RCR (Criminal) 858 also states that each case is to be determined on the factual matrix of that case. This Court has already held that testimony of the prosecutrix aspires confidence, therefore, in view of the discussion made above and the observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court in the judgments relied, this Court is of the opinion that present appeal is devoid of any merit and is thus, liable to be dismissed. Counsel for the appellant has relied upon another judgment of this Court rendered in Balkar Singh v. State of Haryana 2007(4) RCR (Criminal) 597 to contend that taking into consideration long pendency of the trial, sentence awarded upon the appellant should be reduced to the minimum period prescribed. This Court is of the view that there are no special or adequate reasons to reduce the sentence awarded upon the accused appellant. It is Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 not a case where the accused and the prosecutrix had eloped together. It is also not a case of love affair, where because the age of the prosecutrix was less therefore, the sentence should be reduced. In the present case, the appellant had committed offence of rape to satisfy his lust, therefore, there is no scope for reduction in sentence awarded to the accused appellant. Hence, this prayer is also declined. Dismissed. [KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA] JUDGE February 23, 2010 rps"

    "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA\nAT CHANDIGARH\nCriminal Appeal No. 691-SB of 1998\nDate of decision: 23rd February, 2010\nTaqdir Singh \n   Appellant \nVersus \nState of Haryana \n  Respondent\nCORAM: \nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA\nPresent:\nMrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate for the appellant.\nMs. Hemlata Balhara, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana\nfor the State.\nKANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. \nTaqdir Singh son of Lehri Singh has preferred the present\nappeal and has challenged the judgment of conviction and order of\nsentence dated 30th July, 1998, whereby he was held guilty of offence\nunder Section 452 and 376 IPC. The trial Court had sentenced the\nappellant under Section 452 IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a\nperiod of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default of payment of\nfine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant\nwas further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of\nseven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine\nto further undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1   years under Section 376\nIPC. \nASI Devi Dutt PW-10 of Police Station Sahlawas was present\nat Jhajjar, when the prosecutrix PW-1 (whose name has been withheld to\nprotect her identity) along with her husband Nahnu Ram PW-5 appeared\nand made statement Ex.PA, on the basis of which FIR No.32 dated\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\n.05.1996 was registered at Police Station Sahlawas. The prosecutrix\nstated that her parents belong to Dadri Toe. About 11 months before the\noccurrence, she was married with Nahnu Ram. She was staying in her\nmatrimonial home at village Chandol. She had set up a separate\nresidence with her husband three months before the occurrence and her\nin-laws were residing in another house. On 3rd May, 1996 at about 4.00\np.m. her husband had gone to village Bhakli to do the work of Halwai\n(sweet maker) in a marriage and she was alone at her house. At about\n.00 p.m., she went to sleep in the courtyard after bolting the door of her\nhouse. She had retired to her bed after taking her meals. At about 11.00\np.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time,\nthe present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had\ngagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear\nonly. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her\nmouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied\nboth of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in\nboth the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were\nbroken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide\nresistance. The accused had broken the string of Salwar of the\nprosecutrix, removed her panty and forcibly committed sexual intercourse\nupon her. After the occurrence, the accused untied the hands of the\nprosecutrix, removed the cloth from her face and ran away from the spot.\nIn the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in-\nlaw Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was\nsent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm\nto her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house,\nsince the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of\nthe people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant\nalong with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police.\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nShe was going to the Police Station to lodge the report when the police\nofficials met her and she got her statement recorded. It was further stated\nthat Taqdir had left his house from the day of incident and was not\navailable. \nIn the present case, occurrence had taken place on 3rd May,\nat about 11.00 p.m. The prosecutrix had made statement Ex.PA to\nASI Devi Dutt PW-10 on 7th May, 1996 at 1.20 p.m. Case was registered\nat Police Station Sahlawas on 7th May, 1996 at 3.30 p.m. \nThe above said FIR was investigated and report under\nSection 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted against the accused appellant. \nThe case, along with the accused, was committed to the\nCourt of Sessions Judge, Rohtak and was entrusted for trial to the Court of\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Rohtak. On 19th September, 1996, the trial\nJudge charged the appellant for offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC.\nThe charge stated that on 3rd May, 1996 at about 11.00 p.m. in the area of\nvillage Chandol, the appellant committed house-trespass by entering the\nhouse of the prosecutrix, used as human dwelling, having made\npreparation to wrongfully restrain the prosecutrix and thereby committed\nan offence punishable under Section 452 IPC. It was further stated that on\nthe same day, time and place, he had committed offence of rape\npunishable under Section 376 IPC. \nThe appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. \nProsecutrix appeared as PW-1 and reiterated as to what was\nstated in her statement Ex.PA, contents of which have been noticed\nabove. She further sated that Taqdir was her neighbour. In cross\nexamination, this witness admitted that her mother had got a case\nregistered against Hari Singh and Smt. Bala wife of Hari Singh on the\naccusation that Hari Singh had given a kick blow in the stomach of mother\nof the prosecutrix, due to which she got aborted and the child died. She\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\ndenied the suggestion that earlier her mother had compromised the matter\nafter acceptance of money. This witness further stated that when the\naccused appeared near her cot, he was having a 5 feet long Parna (cloth)\nin his hand. She further stated that the elder brother of her husband was\nsent to relay the information to her husband. She further deposed that due\nto breakage of her bangles at the time of incident, she had sustained\ninjuries on her arm s skin but the injuries did not bleed. It was stated that\nher underwear and Salwar were stained with semen. The police had taken\ninto possession the broken bangles, ring and clothes from the house of\nprosecutrix. She denied the suggestion that she had lodged false case\nagainst the accused to save Bansi son of Sube, a driver and accused in a\ncase under Section 377 IPC. Bansi is stated to be Ustad (teacher) of\nhusband of the prosecutrix as he allegedly used to impart lessons to him\nin driving. She further stated that it was not in her knowledge that Bansi\nwas named as accused for having committed unnatural intercourse with\nson of the accused. \nHead Constable Bharat Singh PW-2, Constable Nafe Singh\nPW-3 and Constable Krishan Kumar PW-4 tendered their affidavits Ex.PB,\nPC and PD respectively to prove link evidence. \nNahnu Ram, husband of the prosecutrix appeared as PW-5.\nHe stated that on 3rd May, 1996, he had gone to village Bhakli to do the job\nof Halwai (sweet maker). On 4th May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m., he received\nthe information through his cousin Ram Kishan and came back to his\nhouse at 6.30 p.m. He divulged the occurrence to the Sarpanch and other\nrespectables of the village and on their advice that the culprit should be\npunished, he along with his wife proceeded to the Police Station, when on\nthe way police party met him and his wife got recorded the statement to\nthe police. In cross examination, this witness stated that the broken\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nbangles were put in a match box by a Sub Inspector. He admitted that his\nfather and the father of accused Taqdir were real brothers. \nDr.Aruna Sangwan, Medical Officer, Community Health\nCentre, Jhajjar PW-6 medico legally examined the prosecutrix on 7th May,\nat 3.45 p.m. No external mark of injury was found, except that there\nwas an old fracture on the right thigh with shortening. In examination of\nexternal organs, a whitish discharge was found present in the vagina. Old\ntags of hymen were present. Vagina admitted two fingers. Vaginal swabs\nfrom posterior fornix were taken. Sample of the pubic hair of the\nprosecutrix was also taken. This witness stated that since the prosecutrix\nhad changed her clothes, they were not taken into possession. This\nwitness had not ruled out the possibility of prosecutrix having sexual\nintercourse. In cross examination, this witness stated that there was no\nexternal mark of injury on the body of the prosecutrix and there was no\nsemen mark on her thigh. \nSI Jagdish Chander PW-7 had prepared the report under\nSection 173 Cr.P.C. \nASI Sumer Singh PW-8 proved registration of the formal FIR\nEx.PA/1 on receipt of ruqa Ex.PA. \nDr.Ram Kumar, Medical Officer PW-9 had examined the\naccused appellant and had opined that there was nothing to suggest that\nthe accused was not fit to perform sexual intercourse. \nASI Devi Dutt PW-10 was the Investigating Officer. He\ndeposed regarding various facets of the investigation. This witness further\nstated that on 13th May, 1996, he had arrested the accused. This witness\nstated that when he had inspected the spot, he had not found any broken\nbangles. This witness admitted that the house of the accused and the door\nof house of the prosecutrix open in the same street. He stated that the\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nboundary wall between the houses of the accused and that of the\nprosecutrix was having a height of three feet. \nSunil Kumar Bhatnagar, Draftsman PW-11 had prepared the\nscaled site plan of the spot Ex.PO. \nSunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix was given up\nas won-over. \nThe Public Prosecutor had placed on record report Ex.PK of\nthe Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban, Haryana, wherein it was\nstated that human semen was detected on multicoloured terrycot Salwar\nand on yellow/brown nylon underwear. \nThereafter, prosecution closed its evidence. Statement of the\naccused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating\ncircumstances were put to him. He denied the same and projected the\nfollowing version in his statement: \n Yes. I am innocent. I have been falsely implicated in\nthis case only to save Bansi s/o Sube Singh who is friend and\nGuru of the husband of the prosecutrix in motor driving, as\nthere was case against him under Section 377 IPC and in\ncharge of P.S. Sahalwas Jagdish Chander was relative of my\nvillage and interested in compromise in the case under\nSection 377 IPC. Both parties were apprehended from the\nvillage on the same day but they were sent to home in evening\nand I was kept in Thana more than 5 and 6 days.  \nIn defence, Jagminder Singh Draftsman was examined as\nDW-1. He proved the site plan Ex.D1. This witness stated that the door of\nthe house of accused faces the street towards the Northern side of his\nhouse. Thereafter, there is a small turning at the northern-western corner\nof the house of accused and thereafter, the street goes to the door of the\nhouse of prosecutrix. \nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nMauji Ram DW-2 stated that as a Sarpanch, he had not heard\nof any incident. This witness stated that it was not in his knowledge that\nthe accused and cousin of Nahnu Ram were challaned under Section\n/151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had only heard about a\nfamily dispute. \nHet Ram DW-3 stated that he had learnt that Taqdir had been\nchallaned under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that\nhe had heard nothing about the accused. In cross examination, this\nwitness stated that there was no case registered against the accused\nunder Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. \nSabha Chand Chaukidar DW-4 stated that the circumstances\nregarding arrest of the accused were not in his knowledge. \nI have heard counsel for the parties. Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann,\nAdvocate appearing for the appellant, has stated that the prosecutrix was\naged about 19-20 years. It is further submitted that at the time of incident,\nprosecutrix was 21 weeks  pregnant. It is submitted that according to the\nprosecution story, accused came to the house of the prosecutrix at 11.00\np.m. He had tied the hands of the prosecutrix with a cloth and had\nallegedly gagged her mouth with the cloth. It is contended that according\nto the prosecutrix, the accused while leaving, had untied her hands and\nhad removed the cloth from her mouth, still the prosecutrix had raised no\nnoise to attract anybody and narrate the incident. These circumstances\naccording to the counsel, make the version projected by the prosecutrix\nunnatural, improbable and unconvincing. It is urged that this Court should\nappreciate the arguments in light of the fact that for four days, the\nprosecutrix had not reported the matter to the police. The occurrence had\ntaken place on 3rd May, 1996, whereas, the report was lodged with the\npolice on 7th May, 1996. Counsel has further stated that according to the\nprosecutrix, her bangles and ring of little finger were broken at the spot\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nand the same were taken into possession by the Investigating Officer. This\nfact was also reiterated by Nahna Ram PW-5, husband of the prosecutrix.\nBut ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 had stated in categoric terms that no bangles\nwere taken into possession and the same were not found at the spot. This\naccording to the counsel, is a material contradiction between the testimony\nof three prime witnesses examined by the prosecution. Furthermore, it\nwas averred that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles had caused\ninjuries on her arms but no such injury was found in the medico legal\nreport, therefore, the medical evidence in no way corroborates the ocular\nversion. It is submitted that vaginal swabs were sent to the laboratory but\nno semen was found. There were no external or internal marks of injury\nsuffered by the prosecutrix. It is further submitted that Sunehri Devi,\nmother-in-law of the prosecutrix, to whom the occurrence was narrated for\nthe first time, was not examined by the prosecution. Even brother of\nhusband of the prosecutrix, who had relayed the information to Nahnu\nRam, husband of the prosecutrix, at the place of his avocation, was not\nexamined. \nAdding force to the above stated arguments, it is urged that\nthe suggestions given by the accused and the version narrated by him in\nhis statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. assumes importance,\nas present and the former Sarpanch of the village had appeared in\ndefence as DW-2 and DW-3 respectively and stated that no occurrence\nhad taken place. This according to the counsel, belies the explanation\nfurnished by the prosecutrix to explain the delay that the villagers had\nprompted her to lodge the report so that the culprit should be punished. \nCounsel for the State has urged that the testimony of\nprosecutrix aspires confidence and can be relied upon without any\ncorroboration. \nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nThere are certain features of this case, which compel this\nCourt to arrive at a conclusion that the testimony of the prosecutrix can be\nrelied upon without any corroboration:\n(a)\nFather of the accused and the father of husband of the\nprosecutrix were brothers, therefore, the accused and\nhusband of the prosecutrix are closely related. \n(b)\nOn the day of occurrence, in connection with his\navocation, husband of the prosecutrix had gone out of\nthe village and the prosecutrix was alone at her house\nwhen in the night accused had trespassed into her\nhouse. \n(c)\nThe version projected regarding the alleged inimical\nrelations has not been proved by the defence. No copy\nof the FIR, report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. or the\nCourt proceedings has been placed on record to prove\nthat the alleged friend (Ustad) of husband of the\nprosecutrix was involved in a case under Section 377\nCr.P.C. Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that the\nprosecutrix and her husband will level false allegations\nof rape to absolve a friend of the husband, especially\nwhen the accused is closely related to them. Thus,\nexcept a bald suggestion and a version under Section\nCr.P.C., nothing has been brought on record to\ncorroborate the same. The suggestion propounded by\nthe defence and the version given under Section 313\nCr.P.C. are to be rejected, being not probable. Once\nthis Court has held that the relations between the\nparties were normal, then it is difficult to believe that the\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nprosecutrix will put reputation of her family at stake by\nleveling false allegations. \n(d)\nIt is not the case of the accused that it is a case of\nconsent. \nThe arguments raised by the defence counsel that there was\na delay of four days in lodging the report to the police; no injury on the\nperson of the prosecutrix was found in the medical evidence, therefore,\nshe had not offered any resistance; the bangles were not recovered and\nthat the defence witnesses have belied the version of the prosecutrix, are\nto be rejected in the context of circumstances enumerated above. \nThe Hon ble Apex Court, in  State of Maharasthra v.\nChandraprakash Kewalchand Jain  (1990) 1 SCC 550, observed as\nunder: \n 15. It is necessary at the outset to state what the\napproach of the court should be while evaluating the\nprosecution evidence, particularly the evidence of the\nprosecutrix, in sex offences. Is it essential that the evidence of\nthe prosecutrix should be corroborated in material particulars\nbefore the court bases a conviction on her testimony ? Does\nthe rule of prudence demand that in all cases save the rarest\nof rare the court should look for corroboration before acting on\nthe evidence of the prosecutrix ? Let us see if the Evidence\nAct provides the clue. Under the said statute  Evidence  means\nand includes all statements which the court permits or requires\nto be made before it by witnesses, in relation to the matters of\nfact under inquiry. Under Section 59 all facts, except the\ncontents of documents, may be proved by oral evidence.\nSection 118 then tells us who may give oral evidence.\nAccording to that section all persons are competent to testify\nunless the court considers that they are prevented from\nunderstanding the questions put to them, or from giving\nrational answers to those questions, by tender years, extreme\nold age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause\nof the same kind. Even in the case of an accomplice Section\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nprovides that he shall be a competent witness against an\naccused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because\nit proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an\naccomplice. However, illustration (b) to Section 114, which\nlays down a rule of practice, says that the court  may  presume\nthat an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is\ncorroborated in material particulars. Thus under Section 133,\nwhich lays down a rule of law, an accomplice is a competent\nwitness and a conviction based solely on his uncorroborated\nevidence is not illegal although in view of Section 114,\nillustration (b), courts do not as a matter of practice do so and\nlook for corroboration in material particulars. This is the\nconjoint effect of Sections 133 and 114, illustration (b).\n. A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on par\nwith an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The\nEvidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be\naccepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She\nis undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and\nher evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to\nan injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of\ncare and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence\nas in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no\nmore. What is necessary is that the court must be alive to and\nconscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a\nperson who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled\nby her. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it\ncan act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of\nlaw or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to\nillustration (b) to Section 114 which requires it to look for\ncorroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place\nimplicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look\nfor evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short\nof corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The\nnature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony\nof the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult\nand of full understanding the court is entitled to base a\nconviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\ninfirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances\nappearing on the record of the case disclose that the\nprosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve\nthe person charged, the court should ordinarily have no\nhesitation in accepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no\ndoubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix\nwho does not lack understanding must be accepted. The\ndegree of proof required must not be higher than is expected\nof an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that\nexception has rightly been taken to the approach of the High\nCourt as is reflected in the following passage:\n It is only in the rarest of rare cases if the\ncourt finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is\nso trustworthy, truthful and reliable that other\ncorroboration may not be necessary. \nWith respect, the law is not correctly stated. If we may\nsay so, it is just the reverse. Ordinarily the evidence of a\nprosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an\ninjured person who is a victim of violence, unless there are\nspecial circumstances which call for greater caution, in which\ncase it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is\nindependent evidence lending assurance to her accusation.\n. We think it proper, having regard to the increase in\nthe number of sex violation cases in the recent past,\nparticularly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to\nremove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman\nwho is a victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be\ncorroborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare\ncases. To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare\ncases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust of\nanother with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult\nwomanhood. It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman\nthat her story of woe will not be believed unless it is\ncorroborated in material particulars as in the case of an\naccomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where it\nconcerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society\nas in some of the western and European countries. Our\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nstandard of decency and morality in public life is not the same\nas in those countries. It is, however, unfortunate that respect\nfor womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases of\nmolestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman\nis now required to suffer indignities in different forms, from\nlewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape.\nDecency and morality in public life can be promoted and\nprotected only if we deal strictly with those who violate the\nsocietal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the\ncourt in such cases must take into account the fact that such\ncrimes are generally committed on the sly and very rarely\ndirect evidence of a person other than the prosecutrix is\navailable. Courts must also realise that ordinarily a woman,\nmore so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling\na false charge concerning her chastity. \nIn the light of the observations made by the Hon ble Apex\nCourt above, this Court cannot ignore that on the Salwar and underwear of\nthe prosecutrix, human semen was detected. It is not necessary that in\nevery case, vaginal swabs must contain semen. Sometimes the accused\nmay discharge the semen outside the vagina. No question to this effect\nwas asked to the prosecutrix. Furthermore, it was stated by the prosecutrix\nthat her hands were tied and her legs were weak, therefore, she could not\noffer resistance to the accused, who was a well built young man. Non-\nexamination of Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, and elder\nbrother (cousin) (Jeth) of husband of the prosecutrix, is also of no\nconsequence as the testimony of the prosecutrix corroborated by her\nhusband is sufficient for reliance, as the same aspires confidence. \nIn  Gita Ram v. State of H.P.  2002 Cri.L.J.3832, Himachal\nPradesh High Court has held that the delay in lodging of the report is of no\nconsequence as victim of sexual assault face a lot of difficulty to come\nforward to depose against the accused, as the reputation of family of the\nprosecutrix is at stake. Relying upon the judgment rendered in  State of\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nPunjab v. Gurmit Singh  (1996) 2 SCC 384, Himachal Pradesh High\nCourt observed as under: \n 22. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh , (1996) 2 SCC\n: (1996 Cri LJ 1728), their Lordships took note of the\nexisting rate of crime against women and held : (SCC p 403,\npara 21) : (at Pp 1739-40, Para 20 of Cri LJ).\n 21. Of late, crime against women in general and\nrape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that\nwhile we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres,\nwe show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad\nreflection on the attitude of indifference of the society\ntowards the violation of human dignity of the victims of\nsex crimes. We must remember that a rapist not only\nviolate the victim's privacy and personal integrity, but\ninevitably causes serious psychological as well as\nphysical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a\nphysical assault it is often destructive of the whole\npersonality of the victim. A murderer destroys the\nphysical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very\nsoul of the helpless female. The Courts, therefore,\nshoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused\non charges of rape. They must deal with such cases\nwith utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the\nbroader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by\nminor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the\nstatement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal\nnature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution\ncase. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence,\nit must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of\nher statement in material particulars. If for some reason\nthe Court finds it different to place implicit reliance on\nher testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend\nassurance to her testimony, short of corroboration\nrequired in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of\nthe prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background\nof the entire case and the trial Court must be alive to its\nresponsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases\ninvolving sexual molestations. \nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nReferring to an earlier judgment in State of Maharashtra\nv. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550 :\n(1990 Cri LJ 889), the Supreme Court in Gurmit Singh case\n(1996 (2) SCC 384 : 1996 Cri LJ 1728) held : (SCC Pp 395-\n, paras 8-9) : (at p 1735, Para 7 of Cri LJ).\n The Courts must, while evaluating evidence,\nremain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self\nrespecting woman would come forward in a Court just to\nmake a humiliating statement against her honour such\nas is involved in the commission of rape on her. In\ncases involving sexual molestation, supposed\nconsiderations which have no material effect on the\nveracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies\nin the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless\nthe discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be\nallowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution\ncase. The inherent bashfulness of the females and the\ntendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are\nfactors which the Courts should not overlook. The\ntestimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless\nthere are compelling reasons which necessitate looking\nfor corroboration of her statement, the Courts should\nfind no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of\nsexual assault alone to convict an accused where her\ntestimony inspires confidence and is found to be\nreliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement before\nrelying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases\namounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the\nevidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or\nsexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or\nsuspicion ? The Court while appreciating the evidence\nof a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her\nstatement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is\na witness who is interested in the outcome of the charge\nlevelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to\ninsist upon corroboration of her statement to base\nconviction of an accused. The evidence of a victim of\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nsexual assault stands almost on a par with the evidence\nof a injured witness and to an extent is even more\nreliable. Just as a witness who has sustained some\ninjury in the occurrence, which is not found to be self\ninflicted, as considered to be a good witness in the\nsense that he is least likely to shield the real culprit, the\nevidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to\ngreat weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding.\nCorroborative evidence is not an imperative component\nof judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration\nas a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of\nthe prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a\nguidance of prudence under given circumstances. It\nmust not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected\nto sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime but\nis a victim of another person s lust and it is improper and\nundesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount\nof suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice.\nInterference have to be drawn from a given set of facts\nand circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead\nuniformity lest that type of rigidity in the shape of rule of\nlaw is introduced through a new form of testimonial\ntyranny making justice a casualty. Courts cannot cling to\na fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even, if,\ntaken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of\nsex crime strikes the judicial mind as deprobable. In\nState of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand\nJain (1990 (1) SCC 550 : 1990 Cri LJ 889), Ahmadi, J.\n(as the Lord Chief Justice then was) speaking for the\nBench summarised the position in the following words :\n(SCC p 559, para 16 : (at Pp 894-95, Para 16 of Cri LJ).\n A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be\nput on a par with an accomplice. She is in fact a\nvictim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere\nsays that her evidence cannot be accepted\nunless it is corroborated in material particulars.\nShe is undoubtedly a competent witness under\nSection 118 and her evidence must receive the\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nsame weight as is attached to an injured in cases\nof physical violence. The same degree of care of\nand caution must attach in the evaluation of her\nevidence as in the case of an injured complainant\nor witness and no more. What is necessary is that\nthe Court must be alive to and conscious of the\nfact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person\nwho is interested in the outcome of the charge\nlevelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind\nand feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence\nof the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or\npractice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar\nto Illustration (b) to Section 114 which required it\nto look for corroboration. If for some reason the\nCourt is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the\ntestimony of the prosecutrix it may look for\nevidence which may lend assurance to her\ntestimony short of corroboration required in the\ncase of an accomplice. The nature of evidence\nrequired to lend assurance to the testimony of the\nprosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts\nand circumstances of each case. But if a\nprosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding\nthe Court is entitled to base a conviction on her\nevidence unless the same is shown to be infirm\nand not trustworthy. If the totality of the\ncircumstances appearing on the record of the\ncase disclose that the prosecutrix does not have\na strong motive to falsely involve the person\ncharged, the Court should ordinarily have no\nhesitation in accepting her evidence. \nWe are in respectful agreement with the above\nexposition of law. In the instant case our careful analysis of\nthe statement of the prosecutrix has created an impression on\nour minds that she is a reliable and truthful witness. Her\ntestimony suffers from no infirmity or blemish whatsoever. We\nhave no hesitation in acting upon her testimony alone without\nlooking for any corroboration. However, in this case there is\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nample corroboration available on the record to lend further\ncredence to the testimony of the prosecutrix.\n. In the light of the above said ratio of the decision of\nthe Apex Court, I find that in the case on hand the testimony of\nthe prosecutrix discussed hereinabove suffers from no\ninfirmity and she is a reliable and truthful witness. There is\nample corroboration available on the record to lend further\ncredence to the testimony of the prosecutrix in the form of the\ndeposition of PW 2 to whom the prosecutrix had narrated the\nincident in the evening on the same day and she disclosed the\noccurrence to her husband immediately after he returned from\nattending the fair. Medical evidence is not of much relevance\nfor the reason that prosecutrix was examined by Dr. Shyam\nafter about 24 days from the alleged day of occurrence and\nfurther because she is a married woman and was habitual of\nsexual inter course. \nIn the present case, the prosecutrix was medico legally\nexamined after four days of the occurrence. \nIn  Karnel Singh v. State of M.P.  1995(3) RCR (Criminal)\n, it was observed as under: \n 7.\n        The submission overlooks the fact\nthat in India women are slow and hesitant to complain of such\nassaults and if the prosecutrix happens to be a married person\nshe will not do anything without informing her husband. Merely\nbecause the complaint was lodged less than promptly does\nnot raise the inference that the complaint was false. The\nreluctance to go to the police is because of society s attitude\ntowards such women; it casts doubt and shame upon her\nrather than comfort and sympathize with her. Therefore, delay\nin lodging complaints in such cases does not necessarily\nindicate that her version is false. \nIn view of the observations of the Hon ble Apex Court, it is\nnecessary to notice the judgments relied by the counsel for the appellant.\nReliance has been placed upon  Tameezuddin @ Tammu v. State of\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\n(NCT) of Delhi  2009(4) RCR (Criminal) 345. A perusal of the said\njudgment reveals that the same is not attracted on the facts of the present\ncase. Their Lordships of Hon ble Apex Court took into consideration the\ntestimony of PW-1 prosecutrix where she told the appellant that everything\nwas forgiven and forgotten. Another judgment relied by the counsel for the\nappellant rendered in  State of Haryana v. Dilawar  2009(3) RCR\n(Criminal) 2001 is also not attracted, as the Court has given credence to\nthe fact that Zile Singh PW-6 in that case had not supported the\nprosecution. Similarly  Kishan v. State of Haryana  2009(3) RCR\n(Criminal) 480, a judgment rendered by a Single Bench of this Court is\nalso not attracted on the facts of the present case, as it was held that the\nevidence of the prosecutrix was neither reliable nor trustworthy. It was\nfurther held that each case depends on its own facts and circumstances.\nAnother judgment cited by counsel for the appellant, rendered by a\nDivision Bench of Hon ble Apex Court in  Pandurang Sitaram Bhagwat v.\nState of Maharashtra  2005(1) RCR (Criminal) 858 also states that each\ncase is to be determined on the factual matrix of that case. \nThis Court has already held that testimony of the prosecutrix\naspires confidence, therefore, in view of the discussion made above and\nthe observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court in the judgments relied,\nthis Court is of the opinion that present appeal is devoid of any merit and\nis thus, liable to be dismissed. \nCounsel for the appellant has relied upon another judgment of\nthis Court rendered in  Balkar Singh v. State of Haryana  2007(4) RCR\n(Criminal) 597 to contend that taking into consideration long pendency of\nthe trial, sentence awarded upon the appellant should be reduced to the\nminimum period prescribed. \nThis Court is of the view that there are no special or adequate\nreasons to reduce the sentence awarded upon the accused appellant. It is\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nnot a case where the accused and the prosecutrix had eloped together. It\nis also not a case of love affair, where because the age of the prosecutrix\nwas less therefore, the sentence should be reduced. In the present case,\nthe appellant had committed offence of rape to satisfy his lust, therefore,\nthere is no scope for reduction in sentence awarded to the accused\nappellant. Hence, this prayer is also declined. \nDismissed. \n[KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA]\nJUDGE \nFebruary 23, 2010\nrps"

    "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA\nAT CHANDIGARH\nCriminal Appeal No. 697-SB of 1998\nDate of decision: 23rd March, 2010\nVidya Parshad Tiwari\n   Appellant \nVersus \nState of Haryana \n  Respondent\nCORAM: \nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA\nPresent:\nMr. Harbhagwan Singh, Senior Advocate with \nMr. Amit Kumar, Advocate for the appellant. \nMr. Manish Deswal, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana\nfor the State. \nKANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. \nPresent appeal has been filed by Vidya Parshad Tiwari son of\nRam Saran Tiwari. He was named as an accused in case FIR No.729\ndated 14.06.1997 registered at Police Station Central Faridabad under\nSection 7 of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 (hereinafter referred to\nas,  the Act ). The appellant has been convicted by the Court of Special\nJudge, Faridabad. \nThe appellant was a Depot holder for supplying sugar and\nkerosene as ration to the beneficiaries under the Public Distribution\nSystem. The trial Court came to the conclusion that the accused had failed\nto maintain the account books properly regarding the months of May and\nJune, 1997. He failed to account for 4 quintals 42 kilograms and 50 grams\nof sugar and 1005 liters of kerosene pertaining to the quota for the month\nof May, 1997. The appellant also failed to account for 900 liters of\nkerosene out of the allotted quota for the month of June, 1997. The\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nappellant had not maintained the sales and stock registers in consonance\nwith the provisions of Clause-9 of the Haryana Prevention of Hoarding and\nMaintenance of Quality Order, 1977 (hereinafter referred to as,  the Quality\nOrder ). Furthermore, it was held that the sale register of sugar for the\nmonth of May 1997 contained various blank entries against which\nsignatures of the consumers were appended and thus, he had also\nviolated Clause-6 of the Quality Order. For these violations, the appellant\nwas held guilty of offence under Section 7 of the Act. Having held the\nappellant guilty, he was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a\nperiod of one year and to pay a fine of Rs.5000/-, in default of payment of\nfine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months. It has\nbeen submitted that the appellant had deposited the fine. \nIn the present case, FIR was registered on the basis of a\nwritten communication sent by J.B. Gondia, District Food and Supplies\nController, Faridabad. It was stated in the FIR that the complainant along\nwith his staff on 13th June, 1997 had conducted the inspection of the\npremises of Vidya Parshad Tiwari, Depot holder, Rajiv Nagar, Faridabad.\nThe appellant had received 6 quintals of levy sugar from the wholesale\ngodown of CONFED, Faridabad in the month of May 1997 for distribution\nto the ration-card holders. After inspection of the registers, it came to the\nlight that the Depot holder had misappropriated 4 quintals 42 kilograms\nand 50 grams of sugar and there were blank entries in the register, which\nwere allegedly signed by the consumers. At the time of inspection, there\nwas no stock in the ration Depot. Furthermore, in the month of May 1997,\nthe Depot holder lifted 2860 liters of kerosene for distribution. The Depot\nholder had not made any entry regarding the quantity of kerosene\ndistributed to the ration-card holders. According to the register, the Depot\nholder had shown distribution of kerosene to 265 ration-card holders. If a\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nmaximum of 7 liters of kerosene per ration-card holder is taken into\nconsideration, then also the Depot holder could not distribute more than\nliters of kerosene. In this manner, the Depot holder had\nmisappropriated 1005 liters of kerosene. In the month of June 1997, the\nDepot holder had lifted 2860 liters of kerosene. No entry was shown in the\nsale register regarding quantity of the kerosene received and its\ndistribution to the ration-card holders. The Depot holder had shown the\ndistribution of kerosene to 280 ration-card holders. If a maximum of 7 liters\nof kerosene per ration-card holder is taken into consideration, then the\ntotal distribution will come to 1960 liters. In this manner the Depot holder\nhad misappropriated 900 liters of kerosene. \nThese violations gave rise to the presumption that the goods\nmeant for distribution through Public Distribution System were sold at a\nhigher price in the open market. For these alleged irregularities and\nviolation of the Quality Order, Special Judge, Faridabad served notice of\naccusation upon the appellant on 12th January, 1998. The appellant\npleaded not guilty and claimed trial. \nJ.B. Gondia, District Food and Supplies Controller, Faridabad\nappeared as PW-1. He reiterated as to what was stated in the complaint\nEx.PA, contents of which have been noticed above. In cross examination,\nthis witness stated that no ration-card holder came with any grievance at\nthe spot against the accused. However, the following suggestion was put\nto this witness: \n It is wrong to suggest that the accused was ill in those\ndays and in his absence kerosene and sugar were distributed\nto the card holders by his younger brother who might not have\nbeen able to maintain the record properly. I did not verify from\nthe card holders whose names were entered in the registers\nthat he or she had actually not received kerosene or sugar. It\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nis wrong to suggest that the accused has been falsely\nimplicated in this case. \nA perusal of the above suggestion reveals that the accused\nwas conscious of not maintaining the record. \nRishi Pal ASI PW-2 had arrested the appellant on 16th July,\n. \nRurra Ram ASI PW-3 was entrusted with the investigation on\nth June, 1997. He had recorded the statements of the witnesses and had\nalso prepared the rough site plan Ex.PB. \nProsecution has placed on record the Quality Order as\nEx.PC. Mr. Harbhagwan Singh, Senior Advocate appearing for the\nappellant, has extensively referred to the Quality Order Ex.PC. This order\ndefines a Dealer as under: \n 2.(b)  Dealer  means a person engaged in the business\nof sale or storage for sale of any article, whether such\nbusiness is carried on in retail or in wholesale, and include the\ndistributing agent of the selling agent of such person; \nClause 3 of the Quality Order reads as under: \n 3.\nThe Government may, by notification, in the\nofficial Gazette, in respect of any article;\n(a)\nthe maximum quantity which may, at any\none time, be possessed by a dealer or a\nproducer;\n(b)\nthe maximum quantity which may, at any\none time, be possessed by any consumer; \n(c)\nthe maximum quantity which may, in any\none transaction be sold to any person by a\ndealer or a producer;\n(d)\nthe quantities fixed in respect of any article\nunder this clause may be different in\ndifferent localities;\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nProvided that no stock limit shall be fixed in\nrespect of producers regarding sugar, khandsari, gur\nand shakkar. \nIt will also be apposite here to reproduce Clause 9 of the\nQuality Order: \n 9.(1) The physical stock balances of various articles in\na fair price shop, authorized and approved by the Government\nor by any officer authorized by it in this behalf, shall conform\nto the book balance as per account books maintained by him. \n(2)\nAll purchases, sales and production made will be\ncorrectly accounted for in the account books maintained and\nshall conform to the actual transaction made.  \nIt is contended before me that the Government has issued no\nnotification under sub-clause 1 of Clause 6. It is further submitted that in\nterms of Clause 3 also, no notification was issued. It has been urged\nbefore me that until under Clauses 6 and 9, the State Government had\nprescribed maximum quantity of any article which may be sold to any\nconsumer or group of consumers, it cannot be held that there was any\nmisappropriation of kerosene or sugar by the appellant.\nI have given my thoughtful consideration to the submissions\nmade before me. The prosecution may have failed to prove on record the\nsubsequent notification which prescribes maximum quantity of an article\nwhich can be issued to a card holder. It is evident that the prevailing\npractice demands that sale and stock registers ought to have been\ntruthfully filled by the appellant. The appellant is also conscious of this fact.\nTherefore, a suggestion was given that due to sickness, the appellant may\nnot have filled up the registers and the Depot was managed by his brother\nRam Parkash Tiwari. The statement of the accused under Section 313\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nCr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating circumstances were put to him.\nHe denied the same and stated as under: \n I am innocent. Entries in the registers Ex.P-1 to Ex.P-4\nare in the handwriting of my brother Ram Parkash Tiwari, who\ncommitted some mistakes. \nFurthermore, Ram Parkash Tiwari was examined as DW-1,\nwho in examination in chief stated as under: \n Vidya Parshad accused is my brother. On 11th of April,\nhe had gone to his native village as our mother was ill at\nthat time. He returned around 15th or 16th of June, 1997. In his\nabsence I had looked after the running of his ration depot. I\nhad distributed various articles to the consumers against\nration cards. I could not maintain appropriate entries in the\naccount books because of rush and my lack of experience.  \nThus, it is a case of the accused that the requisite registers\nwere not maintained and they had not depicted the quota received, the\nsales effected and the stocks available. Consequently, there was a\nviolation of Clause 9 of the Quality Order, which specifically provides that\nphysical stock balance of various articles in a fair-price-shop should\nconform to the book balance as per the account books maintained by the\nDealer. \nHaving held that the appellant had not maintained the\nregisters in consonance with the procedure prescribed, it is difficult for this\nCourt to assume that the stock not available was sold in the open market.\nThus, this Court at the most can say that the appellant was remiss in his\nduty to maintain the necessary registers and account books. The offence\nunder Section 7 of the Act is punishable for a term which should not be\nless than three months but which may extend upto seven years.\nFurthermore, all offences under the Act are to be tried in a summary\nCriminal Appeal No.697-SB of 1998\nmanner under Section 12-A of the Act and the maximum sentence which a\nCourt can award for a summary trial is two years. \nThe inspection, in the present case, was carried in the month\nof June 1997. The appellant is in corridors of the Courts for the last about\nyears and he has suffered mental pain and agony of a protracted trial.\nSince this Court has already held that the appellant had failed to maintain\nthe requisite registers and the account books, it would be in the interest of\njustice in case sentence of the appellant is reduced from one year to three\nmonths rigorous imprisonment.\nWith the aforesaid modification in sentence, present appeal is\ndisposed of.\n[KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA]\nJUDGE \nMarch 23, 2010\nrps"

It has since been decided by the Government of Punjab, with the concurrence of the Government of Himachal Pradesh, that:- i) in cases in which an employee has rendered temporary service under the Government of Himachal Pradesh before joining service with the Government of Punjab, the liability of pensionary benefits for the service will be shared by the Government of Himachal Pradesh to the extent that service would have qualified for the grant of pension under the pension rules applicable to the employees of the Government of Himachal Pradesh; ii) the liability of pensionary benefits for the temporary services rendered under the Government of Punjab before joining service with the Government of Himachal Pradesh will be shared by the Government of Punjab to the extent that service would have qualified for pension under the rules of the Government of Punjab; iii) the amount of pension shall be determined by the Government from the service of which the employee finally retires in acordance with the pension formula applicable in that Government at the time of retirement of the employee; and iv) the gratuity, if any, received by the employees for temporary service under either State Government will have to be refunded by them to the State Government from which it was received for the service under that Government. . This benefit will be admissible only to the following categories of employees namely:- i) those who having been retrenched from the service of the either of the State Governments obtained on their own employment under these State Governments either with or without interruption between the date of retrenchment and the date of retrenchment and the date of new appointment; and CWP No.14125 of 1995 -6- ii) those who while holding temporary posts under either of the State Governments apply for posts under the other State Government through proper channel/with permission of the Administrative authority concerned. . The benefit may be allowed in such cases also in which an employee is required, for administrative reasons/ for satisfying technical requirement, to tender resignation from the temporary post held by him before joining the new appointment, and a certificate, to the effect that such resignation had been tendered for administrative reasons/to satisfy a technical requirement to join the new posts with the permission of the Administrative authority concerned may be issued by the authority accepting the resignation. Necessary record may also be made in the service book under proper attestation to enable the employee concerned to get this benefit at the time of retirement. . These orders shall come into force with effect from the 31st March, 1982 and cases of all employees retiring on that date or thereafter will be regulated accordingly. No.16/9889-IFPIII/4526, dated: Chandigarh the, 20.03.1986 A copy, each, with spare copy signed in ink, is forwarded to:- i) The Accountant General (Accounts and Entitlement) Punjab, Chandigarh. ii) The Accountant General (Audit), Punjab, Chandigarh. for information and necessary action. Endst. No.5367-5427-/10-61-XVIII/E1(4), dt.

Sd/- D.D.A (HQ) for Director of Agriculture, Punjab. CWP No.14125 of 1995 -7- . The reply given by the respondents to the relevant para (Para No.8), where the said circular has been referred to and relied upon by the petitioner, is the same; that is, that at the time of his selection, the petitioner had neither requested the Punjab Public Service Commission for protection of his pay on his selection as Statistical Officer, nor had the Punjab Public Service Commission recommended the same. . On a query put to Sh. K.K. Gupta, learned Addl. Advocate General, Punjab, he has relied upon the same submissions as made in the written statement; and has further argued that, it was for the petitioner to apply to the Himachal Pradesh Government to grant him such pensionary benefits. . I absolutely fail to understand, as to how the stand taken in the written statement, and by the learned counsel for the respondents, is tenable in any manner, in the face of the clear cut circular/instructions issued by the Finance Department, vide Memo dated 20.03.1986, reproduced hereinabove. As to why the petitioner (now a pensioner), should be made to run to the Government of Himachal Prades to claim his pensionary benefits, when the present respondents (State of Punjab in the Department of Agriculture), are bound by the said circular/instructions, is not understandable. The circular makes it incumbent upon the Punjab Government, to claim proportionate share of the petitioner pension from the Himachal Pradesh Government. It needs mention that nowhere in the reply is it stated that the petitioner's earlier service in Himachal Pradesh, does not qualify for pension. . No doubt, no plea has been raised by the respondents, but it is, nevertheless, necessary to deal with the same that, the said CWP No.14125 of 1995 -8- circular/instructions, refer to only service rendered by temporary employees in either State, for the purpose of such service is to be counted in the either State, towards pensionary benefits. However, this cannot be a bar for an employee better placed than a temporary employee, who was confirmed in the first State and, thereafter, joined service of the second State. Thus, if benefit of temporary service in another State can be given to an employee in the second State, there is no rational basis, whatsoever, for denying such benefit to an employee who was confirmed in the first State and, subsequently was employed in the other State. . Further, though the Government of Himachal Pradesh has not been impleaded as a party in the present writ petition, however, in view of the fact that the Memo dated 20.03.1986 categorically refers to a reciprocal agreement between the two States, it would not be necessary for such impleadment, in view of the fact that the liability to be foisted on that Government, would be in terms of the reciprocal agreement so reached. . I, therefore, hold that the respondents would be bound by the said circular/instructions (dated 20.03.1986), which are not denied by them, and, as such, the petitioner would be entitled to the benefits of the same, as per its terms and conditions. . The writ petition is thus allowed, to the extent of grant of pensionary benefits to the petitioner, by counting his service rendered in Himachal Pradesh. The respondents are directed to work out all the pensionary benefits, admissible to the petitioner after counting the service rendered by him in the Government of Himachal Pradesh, prior CWP No.14125 of 1995 -9- to his joining service in the State of Punjab on the post of Statistical Officeer. Such benefits would be worked out and paid to the petitioner within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order. . Needless to say, the liability to be incurred upon the Government of Himachal Pradesh would be taken up by the respondents with that State Government in terms of the reciprocal agreement reached between the two States, referred to in the Circular dated 20.03.1986.

JUSTICE AMOL RATTAN SINGH\nPresent: \nMr. Puneet Gupta, Advocate \nfor the petitioner. \nMr. K.K. Gupta, Addl. Advocate General, Punjab\nfor the respondents-State. \n***\nAmol Rattan Singh, J.\n.\nIn this petition, the petitioner has sought the benefits of the\nservice rendered by him with the Government of Himachal Pradesh, as a\nCollege Lecturer, towards protection of substantive pay, pay fixation\nand other benefits, including pensionary benefits, for his subsequent\nservice with the Punjab Government. \n.\nAt the very outset, Sh. Puneet Gupta, learned counsel for\nthe petitioner, stated that he only presses the case for grant of benefit of\nthe said service in Himachal Pradesh, for pensionary benefits.\n.\nThe admitted facts of the case are that, the petitioner was\nappointed as a Lecturer of Economics in the Education Department of\nCWP No.14125 of 1995 \n-2-\nHimachal Pradesh on 29.09.1967, in the pay scale of `300-600/-. He\nwas confirmed as such w.e.f. 10.03.1972. \n.\nIn response to an advertisement issued by the Punjab Public\nService Commission, for recruitment to the post of Statistical Officer\n(PAS Class-I), in the Agriculture Department of the Punjab Government,\nthe petitioner applied through proper channel and his application was\nforwarded by the Director of the Education Department, Himachal\nPradesh to the Secretary, Punjab Public Service Commission, Patiala,\nvide letter dated 31.08.1973, (annexed as Annexure P-1 with the\npetition). \n.\nHaving been duly selected by the Commission, he was\nappointed as Statistical Officer, in the pay scale of `400-1250/-.\nConsequent thereupon, the Director of Education, Himachal Pradesh,\nordered his relieving on 27.05.1974, with the condition that he would\nresign his post on the expiry of two years from the date of his relieving,\nin case he does not join back in the department; that's to say, his lien was\nretained for a period of two years, in the Department of Education, in\nHimachal Pradesh. \nHe was actually relieved by the Principal, Government\nCollege, Nahan (Himachal Pradesh), on the afternoon of 30.05.1974, on\nwhich date he was drawing a substantive pay of `450/-. He joined\nthereafter, in Punjab. \nThereafter, he resigned from Himachal Pradesh, and his\nresignation was accepted w.e.f. 31.05.1976, vide order dated\n.10.1976, which is also annexed as Annexure P-3 with the petition. \n.\nIt is stated by the petitioner, and not denied by the\nrespondents, that upon entering into service in Punjab, he represented to\nCWP No.14125 of 1995 \n-3-\nthe respondents that his pay at the rate of `450/- be protected, as he was\na confirmed employed of the Himachal Pradesh Government and that\nthe same benefit had been granted to one Sh. Sukhdev Singh, who was\nearlier working with the Himachal Pradesh Government and was\nsubsequently employed by the respondent department, i.e. Directorate of\nAgriculture, Punjab. \n.\nVide letter dated 13.9.1988, the petitioner was informed\nthat his case for counting  temporary service  rendered in the\nGovernment of Himachal Pradesh, would be considered as soon as he is\nconfirmed in his present post, i.e. the post of Statistical Officer. Though,\nin the reply, it is stated that his representation was rejected in the year\n, but it is, at the same time, admitted that it was subsequently\ndecided on 19.04.1988, that his case for counting of previous service\nwould be considered upon his confirmation. \n.\nThereafter, the petitioner was confirmed in the Punjab\nAgriculture Service, Class-I, on 02.11.1992, upon which he again\nrepresented for benefit of previous service. The representation having\nbeen rejected in March, 1994, he yet again represented on 04.10.1994\nthat his case be considered sympathetically, upon which he was again\ninformed on 19.05.1995 that his case had already been rejected earlier.\nThese factual aspects are not denied in the reply filed by the\nrespondents. \n.\nThe stand taken in the reply filed, is that, since the\npetitioner had not requested the Punjab Public Service Commission for\nprotection of his pay for pensionary purposes, at the time when he\napplied for the post of Statistical Officer, Punjab, his case has been\nCWP No.14125 of 1995 \n-4-\nrejected. As opposed to this, the case of Sh. Sukhdev Singh, cited by the\npetitioner, was accepted, in view of the fact that he had made such a\nrepresentation, along with his application, to the Punjab Public Service\nCommission, which had accepted the same. Consequently, the\nGovernment had implemented the decision of the Punjab Public Service\nCommission. \n.\nSh. Puneet Gupta, learned counsel for the petitioner, has\ndrawn my attention to copy of a Memo dated 20.03.1986 (Annexure P-\n), issued by the Department of Finance and addressed to all the Heads\nof Departments in the State of Punjab, duly received by the Director,\nAgriculture, Punjab, i.e. respondent No.2. The said memo/circular\nstates, in effect, that, after consultations between the Governments of\nPunjab and Himachal Pradesh, it has been decided, on reciprocal basis,\nthat the proportionate pensionary liability in respect of those temporary\nemployees, who had rendered  temporary service  under either the\nPunjab or the Himachal Pradesh Governments, prior to obtaining posts\nunder the other State Government, would be shared by such previous\ngovernment to the extent that such service qualified for pensionary\nbenefits. \nThe said circular is reproduced here, in extenso: \n Copy of Memo. No.16/98/80-IFP-III/4525, dated: 20.03.1986 from\nDeputy Secretary Finance(s), Government of Punjab, Department of\nFinance (Finance Personnel III Branch) addressed to all the Heads of\nDepartments and others.\nSubject: Allocation of Pensionary liability in respect of temporary\nservice rendered under the Government of Punjab and the Government\nof Himachal Pradesh. \nSir, \nCWP No.14125 of 1995 \n-5-\nI am directed to refer to the subject noted above and to say that\nthe Government of Punjab has been considering in consultation with\nthe Government of Himachal Pradesh the question of sharing, on a\nreciprocal basis, the proportionate pensionary liabilities in respect of\nthose temporary employees who had rendered temporary service under\neither of the State Governments of Punjab and Himachal Pradesh prior\nto obtaining posts under the other State Government on their own\nvolition in response to advertisements or circulars, including those by\nthe State Public Service Commissions and who are eventually\nconfirmed in their new posts.

      "complainant Pala Ram (P.W.3), injured Hukam Singh (P.W.4) and Zile Singh (P.W.5); meaning thereby question of false implication of the accused did not arise. Pala Ram (P.W.3), Hukam Singh (P.W.4) and Zile Singh (P.W.5) had no axe to grind against the accused. The accused had some dispute with Jeet Singh (P.W.11) regarding tenancy/rent and they were quarrelling with Jeet Singh. The occurrence had taken place in front of the house of Hukam Singh (P.W.4). Pala Ram (P.W.3), brother of Hukam Singh, had come to -5- Criminal Appeal No.743-SB of 1998. meet Hukam Singh. Both Pala Ram and Hukam Singh intervened to end the quarrel. However, appellant Gurnam Singh struck a `Gandasa' blow to Hukam Singh on his neck and appellant Satnam Singh gave multiple injuries with `Lathi' to Jeet Singh. Jagdish (P.W.8) and Ramesh (P.W.9) had also been attracted to the spot. However, Jagdish (P.W.8), Ramesh (P.W.9) and Jeet Singh injured (P.W.11) did not support the case of the prosecution and were got declared hostile by the Public Prosecutor. Jagdish (P.W.8), Ramesh (P.W.9) and Jeet Singh injured (P.W.11) were cross-examined by the Public Prosecutor. A verdict of acquittal cannot follow the moment the witnesses turn hostile and dispensation of justice is not dependant upon the witnesses who make efforts to hold the law to ransom. Once the prosecution case is established on record by the other cogent and trustworthy evidence led by the prosecution, non-supporting of its case by the witnesses who appeared to have been won over by the accused does not at all affect the prosecution case. Learned counsel for the appellants argued that Pala Ram (P.W.3), Hukam Singh (P.W.4) and Zile Singh (P.W.5) are real brothers and, therefore, their statements cannot be relied upon being interested witnesses. However, merely because of their relationship inter se, there statements cannot be brushed aside in case they otherwise inspire confidence of the Court. Zile Singh (P.W.5) is a witness to the recoveries of `Gandasa' and `Lathi' from the accused in consequence of their disclosure statements. Hukam Singh (P.W.4), -6- Criminal Appeal No.743-SB of 1998. having received a dangerous to life injury on his neck, is a stamped witness of the prosecution. His version is supported by Pala Singh (P.W.3), who had witnessed the occurrence which took place in front of the house of Hukam Singh (P.W.4). Pala Singh (P.W.3) is a natural witness. Statements of Pala Singh and Hukam Singh get complete corroboration from the medical evidence furnished by Dr. R.K. Tandon (P.W.1), who had medico- legally examined injured Jeet Singh and Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6), who had medico-legally examined injured Hukam Singh. Dr. R.K. Tandon (P.W.1) had observed eight injuries on the person of Pala Singh, which were multiple abrasions on the left chin, leg, thyroid cartilage, lower half of neck, front of chest, right upper part of the abdomen, back of right elbow joint, both knee joints, on the middle of lower back at the level of iliac crest. As mentioned above, Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6) had medico- legally examined injured Hukam Singh. He had observed a wound on the neck of Hukam Singh. Vertebral bone was visible in the depth of the wound. Probing was not done due to risk of life of Hukam Singh. The wound was present on the back of neck on both sides of mid line being 7 cms on left side of mid line and rest of the wound on the left side. It was obliquely placed. There was fresh bleeding present in the wound. On an application moved by the accused, Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6) opined that the possibility could not be ruled out that the injury suffered by Hukam Singh on his neck could have caused his death. He further opined the possibility of the said injury having been suffered by -7- Criminal Appeal No.743-SB of 1998. Hukam Singh with `Gandasa' (Exhibit P.1) could not be ruled out. The medical evidence furnished by Dr. R.K. Tandon (P.W.1) and Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6), thus, lends complete corroboration to the ocular version given by Pala Ram (P.W.3), Hukam Singh (P.W.4). Under the circumstances, the inescapable conclusion is that the appellants had caused injuries to Hukam Singh and Jeet Singh. For the aforesaid reasons, I do not find any merit in this appeal and the same is hereby dismissed. January 21, 2010. ( MOHINDER PAL ) ak JUDGE"

For the former\n-2-\n Criminal Appeal No.743-SB of 1998.\noffence, the appellants were sentenced to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment for three years and to pay fine of Rs.2,000/- each,\nin default whereof to undergo further imprisonment for three\nmonths and for the latter offence they were sentenced to undergo\nrigorous imprisonment for three months. However, both the\nsentences awarded to the appellants were ordered to run\nconcurrently.\nBachan Singh (co-accused of the appellants) died during\nthe trial and criminal proceedings against them, accordingly,\nstood abated. \nIn brief, the case of the prosecution is that on 13.5.1993\nat about 9.30 P.M, Gurnam Singh and Jeet Singh were quarrelling\nwith each other as there was some dispute amongst them about\nrent. Hearing their noise, Hukam Singh and Pala Singh went there.\nHukam Singh asked them as to why they were quarrelling with each\nother. Upon this, Bachan Singh (died accused) caught hold of\nHukam Singh. Appellant Gurnam Singh gave a `Gandasa' blow to\nHukam Singh on his neck. Appellant Satnam Singh gave a\n`Lathi' blow to him. On receipt of the said injuries, Hukam Singh\nfell down. The accused also gave `Lathi' blows to Ajit Singh, who\nsustained multiple injuries on his body. Pala Ram raised an alarm\nattracting Jagdish, Ramesh and some other persons to the spot.\nThey save the victims from the clutches of the accused. The\naccused, while leaving the spot, threatened Hukam Singh that\nthey would kill him whenever they got a chance to do so. The\ninstant F.I.R was registered on the basis of statement made by Pala\n-3-\n Criminal Appeal No.743-SB of 1998.\nSingh before the police. \nDuring investigation, weapons of offence i.e `Lathi' and\n`Gandasi' were recovered from the possession of accused-appellants\nSatnam Singh and Gurnam Singh, respectively, in consequence of\ntheir disclosure statements. \nDr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6), who had medico-legally\nexamined injured Hukam Singh, on an application moved by\nthe accused, opined that the possibility could not be ruled out\nthat the injury suffered by Hukam Singh on his neck could have\ncaused his death. He further opined the possibility of the said\ninjury having been suffered by Hukam Singh with `Gandasa'\n(Exhibit P.1) could not be ruled out. \nAfter completion of investigation, report under Section\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure was presented by the\npolice against the accused in the Court of the Ilaqa Magistrate,\nwho committed the case to the Court of Session.\nThe accused were charged for the offences punishable\nunder Sections 307, 323 and 506 read with Section 34 of the Code.\nThey did not plead guilty to the charge and claimed trial. \nAt the trial, the prosecution examined Dr. R.K.

Nigam (P.W.6), who had medico-legally examined injured\nHukam Singh, Patwari Daya Nand (P.W.7), an eye-witness\nJagdish (P.W.8), who turned hostile, another eye-witness Ramesh\n-4-\n Criminal Appeal No.743-SB of 1998.\n(P.W.9), who also turned hostile, Assistant Sub Inspector Zile Singh\n(P.W.10), injured Jeet Singh (P.W.11), who also turned hostile and\nDr.Sunil Bajaj (P.W.12). \nAfter the closure of the prosecution evidence, statements\nof the accused were recorded under Section 313 of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure in which they denied the prosecution allegations\nand pleaded false implication. However, no evidence was led by\nthem in defence. \nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone\nthrough the records of the case.\nComplainant Pala Ram (P.W.3), injured Hukam Singh\n(P.W.4) and Zile Singh (P.W.5), witness to the recoveries of\nweapons of offence from the accused in consequence of the\ndisclosure statements made by them, have completely supported\nthe prosecution story, as unfolded in the earlier part of the\njudgment. There is no dispute with regard to the identity of the\naccused. It is also worth-mentioning here that there was no\nenmity between the accused and complainant Pala Ram (P.W.3),\ninjured Hukam Singh (P.W.4) and Zile Singh (P.W.5); meaning\nthereby question of false implication of the accused did not\narise. Pala Ram (P.W.3), Hukam Singh (P.W.4) and Zile Singh\n(P.W.5) had no axe to grind against the accused. The accused\nhad some dispute with Jeet Singh (P.W.11) regarding\ntenancy/rent and they were quarrelling with Jeet Singh. The\noccurrence had taken place in front of the house of Hukam Singh\n(P.W.4). Pala Ram (P.W.3), brother of Hukam Singh, had come to\n-5-\n Criminal Appeal No.743-SB of 1998.\nmeet Hukam Singh. Both Pala Ram and Hukam Singh\nintervened to end the quarrel. However, appellant Gurnam Singh\nstruck a `Gandasa' blow to Hukam Singh on his neck and\nappellant Satnam Singh gave multiple injuries with `Lathi' to Jeet\nSingh. Jagdish (P.W.8) and Ramesh (P.W.9) had also been\nattracted to the spot. However, Jagdish (P.W.8), Ramesh\n(P.W.9) and Jeet Singh   injured (P.W.11) did not support the\ncase of the prosecution and were got declared hostile by the\nPublic Prosecutor. Jagdish (P.W.8), Ramesh (P.W.9) and Jeet\nSingh   injured (P.W.11) were cross-examined by the Public\nProsecutor. A verdict of acquittal cannot follow the moment\nthe witnesses turn hostile and dispensation of justice is not\ndependant upon the witnesses who make efforts to hold\nthe law to ransom. Once the prosecution case is established\non record by the other cogent and trustworthy evidence led by\nthe prosecution, non-supporting of its case by the witnesses\nwho appeared to have been won over by the accused does not at\nall affect the prosecution case. Learned counsel for the\nappellants argued that Pala Ram (P.W.3), Hukam Singh (P.W.4)\nand Zile Singh (P.W.5) are real brothers and, therefore, their\nstatements cannot be relied upon being interested witnesses.\nHowever, merely because of their relationship inter se, there\nstatements cannot be brushed aside in case they otherwise inspire\nconfidence of the Court. Zile Singh (P.W.5) is a witness to the\nrecoveries of `Gandasa' and `Lathi' from the accused in\nconsequence of their disclosure statements. Hukam Singh (P.W.4),\n-6-\n Criminal Appeal No.743-SB of 1998.\nhaving received a dangerous to life injury on his neck, is a\nstamped witness of the prosecution. His version is supported by\nPala Singh (P.W.3), who had witnessed the occurrence which took\nplace in front of the house of Hukam Singh (P.W.4). Pala Singh\n(P.W.3) is a natural witness. Statements of Pala Singh and\nHukam Singh get complete corroboration from the medical\nevidence furnished by Dr. R.K. Tandon (P.W.1), who had medico-\nlegally examined injured Jeet Singh and Dr. P.K. Nigam\n(P.W.6), who had medico-legally examined injured Hukam Singh.\nDr. R.K. Tandon (P.W.1) had observed eight injuries on the\nperson of Pala Singh, which were multiple abrasions on the left\nchin, leg, thyroid cartilage, lower half of neck, front of chest,\nright upper part of the abdomen, back of right elbow joint, both\nknee joints, on the middle of lower back at the level of iliac\ncrest. As mentioned above, Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6) had medico-\nlegally examined injured Hukam Singh. He had observed a\nwound on the neck of Hukam Singh. Vertebral bone was visible\nin the depth of the wound. Probing was not done due to risk of life\nof Hukam Singh. The wound was present on the back of neck on\nboth sides of mid line being 7 cms on left side of mid line and rest of\nthe wound on the left side. It was obliquely placed. There was\nfresh bleeding present in the wound. On an application moved\nby the accused, Dr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6) opined that the\npossibility could not be ruled out that the injury suffered by\nHukam Singh on his neck could have caused his death. He further\nopined the possibility of the said injury having been suffered by\n-7-\n Criminal Appeal No.743-SB of 1998.\nHukam Singh with `Gandasa' (Exhibit P.1) could not be ruled out.\nThe medical evidence furnished by Dr. R.K. Tandon (P.W.1) and\nDr. P.K. Nigam (P.W.6), thus, lends complete corroboration to the\nocular version given by Pala Ram (P.W.3), Hukam Singh (P.W.4).\nUnder the circumstances, the inescapable conclusion is that the\nappellants had caused injuries to Hukam Singh and Jeet Singh. \nFor the aforesaid reasons, I do not find any merit in this\nappeal and the same is hereby dismissed. \n\nJanuary 21, 2010.\n\n ( MOHINDER PAL )\nak\n\n JUDGE"

JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA\nPresent: \nMr. Bipan Ghai, Senior Advocate with\nMr. M.L. Saini, Advocate for the appellant.\nMr. Manish Deswal, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana\nfor the State. \nKANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. (ORAL)\nThe Court of Additional Sessions Judge, Gurgaon tried\nJoginder Singh son of Ram Parshad, Kishan Chand and Satbir Singh\nsons of Gulab Singh as accused in case FIR No.18 dated 25.01.1994\nregistered at Police Station Bilaspur under Sections 308, 323, 34 IPC. \nThe trial Court, while acquitting Joginder Singh and Satbir\nSingh of the charge, has convicted the appellant Kishan Chand for\noffence under Section 325 IPC and sentenced him to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment for a period of 3   years and to pay a fine of Rs.5000/-, in\ndefault of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for six\nmonths. It was further ordered that out of the amount of fine, Rs.3000/-\nshall be paid as compensation to the injured. \nMr.Bipan Ghai, Senior Advocate assisted by Mr.M.L. Saini,\nAdvocate, appearing for the appellant, has out-rightly submitted that he\nwill not be able to assail the conviction of the appellant, as the injured\nCriminal Appeal No. 783-SB of 1998\nMukesh PW-6 had deposed against the appellant and his evidence has\nbeen held to be reliable by the trial Court. In his examination in-chief,\nMukesh PW-6, had stated that on 6th December, 1993 at about 5.00 p.m.\nhe was present in his house in village Pachagaon when he heard a noise\noutside the house. On hearing the noise, he along with his mother Ratni\ncame out of the house and found that Joginder accused was beating his\nbrother Narinder Singh. When he wanted to separate his brother, the\naccused appellant Kishan gave two lathi blows on his head, as a result of\nwhich he became unconscious. His mother took him to the house and\ntherefrom, he was taken to Pushpanjli Hospital, Gurgaon. It is further\nstated in the examination in-chief that he remained in the Pushpanjli\nHospital, Gurgaon from 6th December, 1993 to 8th December, 1993. In his\ncross examination, this witness stated that before the occurrence in\nquestion, neither there was any dispute nor any quarrel with the accused.\nMukesh PW-6 had given his age as 16 years at the time of recording of\nhis evidence. \nThe testimony of Mukesh PW-6 had been corroborated by\nhis mother Ratni PW-8. \nDr.Ashwani Kumar, Medical Practitioner appeared as PW-7\nand deposed that on 6th December, 1993 he was employed as a part-time\nconsultant at Pushpanjli Hospital, Gurgaon. He had admitted Mukesh on\nth December, 1993 and discharged him on 7th December, 1993. At the\ntime of discharge, Mukesh was fully conscious and his condition was\nstable. Mukesh was again examined on 10th December, 1993 by\nDr.Rajeev Sharma PW-4. He found following injuries on the person of\nMukesh:\n.\nCut lacerated wound on left side parietal region 2 cm\nfrom the mid-line, size 2 cm x 1 cm. \nCriminal Appeal No. 783-SB of 1998\n.\nDeep abrasion size 2 cm x 0.5 cm, two fingers below\nand posterior to injury No.1. \nThis witness in the cross examination stated that probability\nof both the injuries having been caused by one blow or by fall on hard\nsurface cannot be ruled out. \nDr.Monika Chaudhary PW-5 stated that she had conducted\nradiological examination of Mukesh and found that there was a fracture of\nleft parieto occipital bone. \nDr.Raj Kumar PW-14 stated that Mukesh was admitted in\nWard No.5/3 with head injury. He was discharged on 20th December,\n. There was a fracture of skull of left parieto occipital bone and it was\na depressed fracture. \nIn view of the medical evidence noticed above, the learned\ncounsel has prayed for reduction of sentence without assailing the\nconviction. From the medical evidence noticed above, it has emerged that\nthe injured Mukesh had suffered two injuries. Injury No.2 was abrasion\nwhereas injury No.1 had caused fracture of left parieto occipital bone.\nThe injured was admitted on 6th December, 1993 in a private hospital and\nwas discharged on 7th December, 1993. He was again admitted in\nMedical College and Hospital, Rohtak on 10th December, 1993 and was\ndischarged on 20th December, 1993. It has nowhere emerged in the\nevidence that the injury had caused oedema of the brain or had caused\nany permanent damage to the injured Mukesh PW-6. Furthermore, the\ntrial Court has found that the offence in the present case will not fall under\nSection 308 IPC but under Section 325 IPC. \nOccurrence, in the present case, had taken place in the year\n. A period of more than 16 years has already elapsed. The appellant\nis in the corridors of the Court since long and has suffered mental pain\nCriminal Appeal No. 783-SB of 1998\nand agony of a protracted trial. Taking all these factors into consideration,\nthis Court is of the view that ends of justice will be fully met in case\nsentence awarded upon the appellant is reduced from 3   years to 1  \nyears rigorous imprisonment. \nWith the modifications in sentence noticed above, present\nappeal is disposed of.\n\n[KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA]\nJUDGE\nMarch 5, 2010\nrps"

Maina (P.W.4), mother of the prosecutrix, in her cross- examination stated that the prosecutrix was married about two years prior to the occurrence; that she stayed at her matrimonial house only for a night; that the prosecutrix was willing to go to her matrimonial house; that they were interested to send the prosecutrix to her matrimonial house and that the husband of the prosecutrix was also willing to take her. Smt. Maina (P.W.4),admitted that the prosecutrix was mentally deranged. -4- Criminal Appeal No.945-SB of 1998. After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and going through the evidence on record, I am of the considered opinion that it was a case of attempted sexual intercourse falling within the definition of Section 376 read with Section 511 of the Code. The evidence of Smt. Maina (P.W.4), Dharambir (P.W.5) and Smt. Mafia (P.W.6) establishes the case of the prosecution against the appellant. Smt. Maina (P.W.4), mother of the prosecutrix, stated that when she returned from the fields after collecting fodder, she heard the `raula' and went to the place of occurrence where she found the prosecutrix lying naked. The appellant had also put off one of his trousers. He was trying to commit rape upon the prosecutrix. On seeing Smt.Maina, the appellant ran away from the spot. Dharambir (P.W.5) and Smt. Mafia (P.W.6), who had been attracted to the spot on hearing the noise, had witnessed the appellant running away from the spot while chaining / zipping his Pants. No doubt Smt. Maina (P.W.4) has admitted in her cross-examination that the prosecutrix was mentally deranged and, thus, obviously unable to get her statement recorded before the police, but keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case this fact hardly affects the veracity of the prosecution version. As the prosecutrix was not examined by the prosecution, it shows that she was not capable of deposing before Court. In offences like the present one, the prosecutrix is the main and key witness because she being the victim can narrate the incident. As noticed above, besides the prosecutrix, in this case there -5- Criminal Appeal No.945-SB of 1998. is evidence of Smt. Maina (P.W.4), Dharambir (P.W.5) and Smt. Mafia (P.W.6), discussed above, which connects the accused with the crime. There was no hindrance for the mother of the prosecutrix to get the First Information Report recorded in this case by making her statement before the police. It appears that in fact Smt. Maina had narrated the facts before the Investigating Officer, but the Investigating Officer, with an object to help the accused, got the thumb impression of the prosecutrix on the statement (Exhibit P.A) knowing fully well that she (prosecutrix) was mentally deranged. The Investigating Officer ought to have recorded the First Information Report on the statement of Smt. Maina if the prosecutrix was not in a position to explain the things because of her mental incapability and there would not have been anything illegal in it. If the Investigating Officer got the thumb impression of the prosecutrix on the statement (Exhibit P.A), it does not at all demolishes the prosecution case, which stands otherwise proved on record, as discussed above. A fault committed by the police official cannot be made the basis for not bringing the culprit to book and the facts and circumstances on record, in totality, form the basis for the Courts to reach to a correct conclusion. Had Smt. Maina (P.W.4), mother of the prosecutrix, not arrived at her house timely, the appellant would have been able to commit rape upon the prosecutrix. The appellant had no business to go to the house of the prosecutrix when she was alone. The facts and circumstances of the case, enumerated above, suggest that the -6- Criminal Appeal No.945-SB of 1998. appellant had gone to the house of the prosecutrix to commit rape on her taking advantage of the fact that she was mentally regarded. In view of the above, the prosecution has been able to bring home the guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts under Section 376 read with Section 511 of the Code.

      "also the State) about it all having been consensual affair, the fate of the prosecution shall, thus, turn upon the question of age of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M. The evidence adduced by the prosecution in the context consists of the statements of PW-1 Dr. G.S.Arora (who had conducted the ultrasound examination) of prosecutrix V, PW-11 Dr. Nirmal Bhatia, who conducted the medico legal examinations of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M on 29.4.1996, PW-6 Bhagat Ram, Headmaster, Government Middle School, Sandhir, PW-7 Pawant Kumar, brother of prosecutrix V and PW-8 Ramesh Chand, father of prosecutrix M. Insofar as PW-1 Dr. G.S.Arora is concerned, he did aver in the course of examination-in-chief that he had recorded the age of the prosecutrix as 16 years. However, in the course of cross-examination, he conceded that he had recorded the age of the prosecution on the basis of what already stood recorded in the MLR. PW-11 Dr. Nirmal Bhatia also recorded the age of prosecutrix V as 16 years and age of prosecutrix M as 14 years respectively. In the course of the cross examination, she testified that I have given the age of Vijay Laxmi by approximation as told by her. I did not examine the girls regarding age medically. PW-6 Bhagat Ram, Headmaster, Government Middle School, Sandhir proved certificates Ex. PG/2 and Ex. PF/1 respectively as per which the age of the prosecutrix M is recorded as 10.1.1982 and that of prosecutrix V is recorded as 12.1.1981. PW-7 Pawan Kumar testified that age of prosecutrix V was less than 16 years because she is 12 years younger to him. He had given Criminal Appeal No.97-SB of 1998 -5- **** his age as 27 years. PW-8 Ramesh Chand gave the age of prosecutrix M as 14 years. It is apparent from the record that the prosecution has not placed on record any birth certificates of prosecutrix V and also prosecutrix M. We have to ultimately adjudicate upon the relevant controversy on the basis of the value to be attached to the testimony of PW-6 Bhagat Ram. He could not say who exactly had filled up the admission forms, copies of whereof were placed on record Ex. PG/2 and Ex. PF/1. It is also in his statement that there is no other proof of date of birth of .......... and ........... given in our school alongwith admission form . Though he claimed to have had brought along original admission forms pertaining to prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M, he conceded that he had not brought along the complete file and that he had taken those forms out of the record from the main file in which those were lying pasted. He also conceded that the file in which the admission forms were lying pasted does not have any paging. He also conceded, as correct, a suggestion that there is no date under the signature of the the then Head Master on admission forms copies of which are Ex. PF/1 and Ex. PG/2 He further conceded, as correct, a suggestion that such like blank admission form are available in our school as well as in the market . The persons who got the prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M admitted to the school were not examined at the trial. The prosecution, thus, has not been able to prove at all the basis where upon the date of birth of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M had been recorded in the school admission record. The present is, thus, a case in which the following inference is Criminal Appeal No.97-SB of 1998 -6- **** deducible:- a) No birth record pertaining to prosecutrix V and the prosecutrix M was produced; There is no affirmative evidence either that their birth was not notified. b) There is no proof on the record to indicate the basis where upon the date of birth of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M had been recorded in the school admission form; c) the persons who got prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M admitted into the school were not examined at the trial. In the light thereof, the only inference which is deducible in the circumstances of the case is that the prosecution has not been able to prove the age of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M. The benefit thereof had has to accrue to the appellants, particularly in view of the evidence that it was all a consensual affair, as between prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M and the appellants.

D. ANAND, J.\nThe appellants (in both the appeals aforementioned) were\nconvicted by the learned Trial Judge for the offences under Sections 376,\nand 363 IPC. For the offence under Section 376 IPC, both the\nappellants were directed to undergo imprisonment for a period of seven\nyears and to pay a fine of Rs.5000/- each. For the offence under Section\nCriminal Appeal No.97-SB of 1998\n-2-\n****\nIPC, both the appellants were directed to undergo imprisonment for a\nperiod of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/- each and, for the offence\nunder Section 363 IPC, both the appellants were directed to undergo\nimprisonment for a period of three years and to pay a fine of Rs.1000/-\neach. \nThe prosecution allegations upheld at the trial were as under:-\nAppellant Naresh Kumar is a tailor by profession and so also\nis appellant Isham Singh. On 23.4.1996, prosecutrix V and the prosecutrix\nM, who were class mates in the same educational institution, went over to\nthe shop of the appellants in order to get their clothes stitched. They were\npersuaded by the appellant to stay on at the shop with a promise that they\nwould stitch their clothes there and then. However, appellant Isham Singh\nsuddenly put down shutter of the shop. On finding that, prosecutrix M went\nto the enclosed Bara through back side window of the shop while the\nprosecutrix V continued to remain in the shop; Appellant Naresh Kumar\nfollowed the prosecutrix M. Thereafter, appellant Isham Singh raped\nprosecutrix V. She did not raise a raula as that appellant held out a threat\nthat she would be killed if she raised a raula. When, (after the act) she\ncame out of the shop through that very window, she found her friend the\nprosecutrix M standing in the corner of the Bara. Prosecutrix M told\nprosecutrix V that former had been raped by appellant Naresh. Like-wise,\nthe prosecutrix V informed her friend the prosecutrix M that Isham Singh\nhad likewise ravished her. Both prosecutrix M and prosecutrix V came\nover to their houses but did not share anything with the members of their\nfamilies out of a sense of shame. After about one month thereof,\nprosecutrix V started vomiting. She got suspicious that she might have\nbecome pregnant. She brought the fact to the notice of Isham Singh. He\nCriminal Appeal No.97-SB of 1998\n-3-\n****\nadvised her to finish her examination and assured her that, thereafter, she\nwould be taken to a Doctor at Karnal for treatment. On the asking of\nappellant Isham Singh, both the girls came out of their respective home on\n.4.1996 and reached Bus Stand in the area of village Sandhir where\nappellant Isham Singh again met them. Both the girls came up to Nilokheri\nin a Tonga where appellant Isham Singh met them and the trio were joined\nsoon thereafter by appellant Naresh Kumar. All four of them reached\nKarnal by bus. Isham Singh went alone to find out the availablity of the\nDoctor. He returned some time thereafter and informed the rest of the\nparty that the Doctor was not available. Thereafter, all of them came over\nto Delhi. Both the girls stayed over at Bus Stand; while Isham Singh and\nNaresh Kumar went over to contact a Doctor. They returned sometime\nthereafter and informed that the hospital would open at 5.00 P.M. After\n.00 P.M. Appellants informed the girls that hospital would not open on that\nday. From there, they boarded a train and reached Banaras. There, both\nthe appellants raped prosecutrix V and M respectively. From there, they\ncame over to Ambala where they reached on the evening of 26.4.1996.\nOn 27.4.1996, they reached Rajpura and spent two nights in a park at\nRajpura. In the course of the stay, Isham Singh raped prosecutrix V and\nNaresh raped prosecutrix M. From there, they came over to karnal by bus.\nThey boarded a train from Karnal and reached Nilokheri. It is there that\nthey were apprehended.\nThere is plethora of evidence on the file that prosecutrix V\nand prosecutrix M were consenting party to their elopement from their\nrespective homes and the ravishing of their person by the appellants. It is\nin the evidence that they had been travelling by train, bus and also by\nTonga. All the means of transport aforementioned had the availablity of\nCriminal Appeal No.97-SB of 1998\n-4-\n****\nother persons but the girls did not make a grievance against the appellant.\nIn view of the fact that there is no controversy (as between the appellants\nand also the State) about it all having been consensual affair, the fate of\nthe prosecution shall, thus, turn upon the question of age of prosecutrix V\nand prosecutrix M. The evidence adduced by the prosecution in the\ncontext consists of the statements of PW-1 Dr. G.S.Arora (who had\nconducted the ultrasound examination) of prosecutrix V, PW-11 Dr. Nirmal\nBhatia, who conducted the medico legal examinations of prosecutrix V\nand prosecutrix M on 29.4.1996, PW-6 Bhagat Ram, Headmaster,\nGovernment Middle School, Sandhir, PW-7 Pawant Kumar, brother of\nprosecutrix V and PW-8 Ramesh Chand, father of prosecutrix M.\nInsofar as PW-1 Dr. G.S.Arora is concerned, he did aver in the\ncourse of examination-in-chief that he had recorded the age of the\nprosecutrix as 16 years. However, in the course of cross-examination, he\nconceded that he had recorded the age of the prosecution on the basis of\nwhat already stood recorded in the MLR. \n PW-11 Dr. Nirmal Bhatia also recorded the age of prosecutrix\nV as 16 years and age of prosecutrix M as 14 years respectively. In the\ncourse of the cross examination, she testified that  I have given the age of\nVijay Laxmi by approximation as told by her. I did not examine the girls\nregarding age medically.  \nPW-6 Bhagat Ram, Headmaster, Government Middle School,\nSandhir proved certificates Ex. PG/2 and Ex. PF/1 respectively as per\nwhich the age of the prosecutrix M is recorded as 10.1.1982 and that of\nprosecutrix V is recorded as 12.1.1981.\nPW-7 Pawan Kumar testified that age of prosecutrix V was\nless than 16 years because she is 12 years younger to him. He had given\nCriminal Appeal No.97-SB of 1998\n-5-\n****\nhis age as 27 years.\nPW-8 Ramesh Chand gave the age of prosecutrix M as 14\nyears.\nIt is apparent from the record that the prosecution has not\nplaced on record any birth certificates of prosecutrix V and also prosecutrix\nM. We have to ultimately adjudicate upon the relevant controversy on the\nbasis of the value to be attached to the testimony of PW-6 Bhagat Ram.\nHe could not say who exactly had filled up the admission forms, copies of\nwhereof were placed on record Ex. PG/2 and Ex. PF/1. It is also in his\nstatement that  there is no other proof of date of birth of .......... and ...........\ngiven in our school alongwith admission form . Though he claimed to have\nhad brought along original admission forms pertaining to prosecutrix V and\nprosecutrix M, he conceded that he had not brought along the complete file\nand that he had taken those forms out of the record from the main file in\nwhich those were lying pasted. He also conceded that the file in which the\nadmission forms were lying pasted does not have any paging. He also\nconceded, as correct, a suggestion that  there is no date under the\nsignature of the the then Head Master on admission forms copies of which\nare Ex. PF/1 and Ex. PG/2  He further conceded, as correct, a suggestion\nthat such like  blank admission form are available in our school as well as\nin the market . \nThe persons who got the prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M\nadmitted to the school were not examined at the trial. The prosecution,\nthus, has not been able to prove at all the basis where upon the date of\nbirth of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M had been recorded in the school\nadmission record.\nThe present is, thus, a case in which the following inference is\nCriminal Appeal No.97-SB of 1998\n-6-\n****\ndeducible:-\na)\nNo birth record pertaining to prosecutrix V and the\nprosecutrix M was produced; There is no affirmative\nevidence either that their birth was not notified.\nb)\nThere is no proof on the record to indicate the basis\nwhere upon the date of birth of prosecutrix V and\nprosecutrix M had been recorded in the school\nadmission form;\nc)\nthe persons who got prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M\nadmitted into the school were not examined at the trial.\n\nIn the light thereof, the only inference which is deducible in the\ncircumstances of the case is that the prosecution has not been able to\nprove the age of prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M. The benefit thereof had\nhas to accrue to the appellants, particularly in view of the evidence that it\nwas all a consensual affair, as between prosecutrix V and prosecutrix M\nand the appellants. The appeals shall stand allowed. The impugned\nfinding of conviction is set aside. The appellants are acquitted of the\ncharge.\nDecember 16, 2008\n (S. D. ANAND)\nPka\n\n JUDGE"

JUSTICE MOHINDER PAL.\nPresent:\nMr. Baldev Singh, Senior Advocate, with \nMr. Arshvinder Singh, Advocate, \nfor the appellants.\nMr. Vishal Munjal, Additional Advocate General, Punjab.\n-.-\nMOHINDER PAL, J.\nImpugned in this appeal is the judgment of\nconviction and the sentence order passed by the learned\nSessions Judge, Ludhiana, convicting and sentencing the\nappellants under Section 498-A and 304-B of the Indian Penal\nCode (for short `the Code'). For the former offences, the appellants\nwere sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years\nand to pay fine of Rs.500/-, each, in default whereof to undergo\nfurther rigorous imprisonment for one month and for the latter\n-2-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\noffence the appellants were sentenced to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment for seven years. The substantive sentences of\nimprisonment awarded to the appellants were ordered to run\nconcurrently. \nThe instant case was registered at the instance of\nKahan Singh, brother of Harbans Kaur (deceased). As per facts of\nthe case, Harbans Kaur (deceased) was married to appellant\nTapinderpal Singh on 18.2.1994. Sufficient dowry was given at the\ntime of marriage by the parents of Harbans Kaur according to\ntheir status. Seven or eight days after the marriage, appellant\nTapinderpal Singh, husband of Harbans Kaur, Avtar Singh, her\nfather-in-law and Kartar Kaur, her mother-in-law started\ntelling her that her parents had not given sufficient dowry. On\nthis account, she was mal-treated and was asked to bring\nRs.25,000/- from her parents. Harbans Kaur stated the fact of\ndemand of dowry and ill-treatment by the accused on her visit to\nher parents prior to `Lohri' festival. Kahan Singh, brother of\nHarbans Kaur, Gurcharan Singh, a cousin brother of Harbans Kaur and\nthe mother of Harbans Kaur went to the house of the accused one\nday prior to the `Lohri' and at that time Harbans Kaur stated that\nshe was being subjected to ill-treatment on account of demand of\ndowry. Kahan Singh, Gurcharan Singh and the mother of\nHarbans Kaur told the accused that they were not in a position to\npay the amount and that the same would be paid to the accused\nafter harvesting the crop. \nOn 3.2.1995, complainant Kahan Singh along with\n-3-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nGurcharan Singh again went to meet Harbans Kaur in her\nmatrimonial house. On reaching there, they came to know from the\nneighbours that Harbans Kaur had been taken to hospital at\nSudhar. Then they went to the hospital and learnt that Harbans Kaur\nhad died. Suspecting foul play, complainant Kahan Singh went to\nthe police and got registered the instant case against the\nappellants. \n After completion of investigation and due formalities,\nchallan against the accused was presented before the Ilaqa\nMagistrate, who committed the case to the Court of Session. \nCharge under Sections 498-A and 304-B of the Code\nwas framed against the accused, who did not plead guilty to the\ncharge and claimed trial.\nAt the trial, the prosecution examined Draftsman\nSukhwinder Singh (P.W.1), Dr. S.K. Gupta (P.W.2), complainant\nKahan Singh (P.W.3), Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4), Sub Inspector\nSikattar Singh (P.W.5), Assistant Sub Inspector Makhan Singh\n(P.W.6) and Constable Balbir Singh (P.W.7). \nIn his statement recorded under Section 313 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh,\nbesides denying the prosecution allegations and pleading false\nimplication, stated as under:-\n \nThe deceased was handsome and\nbeautiful lady whereas I am simpleton, hard\nof speaking and physically disabled. She was\n-4-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nnot happy to marry with me and she used\nto remain in a sorrow mood and complained\nme that her parents have married her to a\ndung, which I tolerated. My father on coming\nto know about her condition, took her to\nRaikot hospital from where she was referred\nto Ludhiana hospital and in the way at\nSudhar her condition deteriorated and she had\nto admit at Sudhar. I had cordial relations\nwith my wife and at no stage demanded any\ndowry and it was sufficient that I was married\nwith such a beautiful girl. \nIn their statements recorded under Section 313 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, appellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur\ndittoed the statement of accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh.\nThe accused, in defence, examined Dr.Swaran Singh\nSandhu (D.W.1), Surjit Kaur (D.W.2) and Avtar Kaur (D.W.3). \nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have\ngone through the records of the case. \nAt the outset, it may be mentioned here that keeping\nin view the evidence of the prosecution, its case against\nappellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur is not free from doubt.\nIn his statement made before the police by complainant Kahan\nSingh, brother of Harbans Kaur (deceased) leading to the\nregistration of the instant case against the accused, no specific\n-5-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nallegations have been made against appellants Avtar Singh and\nKartar Kaur, who are parents of appellant Tapinderpal Singh.\nGeneral allegations have been levelled against them i.e\nappellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur, conveying that they\nwere hand in glove with appellant Tapinderpal Singh in\ntorturing Smt.Harbans Kaur on account of insufficiency of dowry.\nIt is a tendency on the part of the family of the victim to\nrope in as many members of the family of the in-laws of the\nvictim in a case like this as possible. Appellant Kartar Kaur was\nfound innocent during investigation by the police and had not\nbeen challaned. She was summoned to face trial by the trial\nCourt on an application moved by the prosecution under Section\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. Appellant Kartar Kaur is a\nteacher by profession and it appears that she had nothing to\ndo with the demand of Rs.25,000/-. Harbans Kaur (deceased)\nwas taken to hospital by appellant Avtar Singh on coming to\nknow about her condition. Avtar Singh appellant had first taken\nHarbans Kaur to the clinic of Dr.Swaran Singh Sandhu (D.W.1)\nat Raikot. Dr. Swaran Singh Sandhu (D.W.1) had referred\nHarbans Kaur to C.M.C, Ludhiana as her condition was serious.\nDr. Swaran Singh Sandhu (D.W.1), who was M.B.B.S, M.S\n(General Surgery) ex-P.C.M.S proved the slip/Certificate (Exhibit\nD.A) whereby Harbans Kaur was referred by him to C.M.C,\nLudhiana. The role of appellant Tapinderpal Singh in the\ncommission of the crime will be discussed in the later part of the\njudgment. However, keeping in view the facts and circumstances\n-6-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nof the case, especially the fact that appellants Avtar Singh and\nKartar Kaur had nothing to do with the demand of dowry, I\nam of the considered opinion that the case of the prosecution\nagainst them has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubts\nand they are entitled to be extended the benefit of doubt. \nThe question arises as to whether accused-appellant\nTapinderpal Singh is liable for the offences under Section 498-A\nand Section 304-B of the Code for which offences he has\nbeen found guilty by the learned trial Judge. Section 304-B of\nthe Code, for facility of reference, is reproduced hereunder:-\n \n-B. Dowry death.- (1) Where\nthe death of a woman is caused by any\nburns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise\nthan under normal circumstances within\nseven years of her marriage and it is shown\nthat soon before her death she was\nsubjected to cruelty or harassment by her\nhusband or any relative of her husband for, or\nin connection with, any demand for dowry,\nsuch death shall be called  dowry death , and\nsuch husband or relative shall be deemed to\nhave caused her death . \n\nAs per the provisions of Section 304-B of the Code,\n-7-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nthe offence of  dowry death  consists of three ingredients i.e\ndeath of a woman is caused by burns or bodily injury or occurs\notherwise than under normal circumstances; that the death\noccurs within seven years of her marriage; and that soon\nbefore her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment\nby her husband or his relatives for or in connection with any\ndemand for dowry. If these three ingredients are there, the\noffence of  dowry death  can be said to be complete and\nproved. \n In this case, admittedly Harbans Kaur had died\nwithin two months of marriage, as her marriage with appellant\nTapinderpal Singh had taken place on 18.12.1994 and she died\non 3.2.1995. Death of Harbans Kaur occurred otherwise than\nunder normal circumstances. Dr. S.K. Gupta (P.W.2), who had\nconducted post mortem examination on the dead body of\nHarbans Kaur, after receipt of the report of the Chemical\nExaminer that Aluminium Phosphide was detected in the\nviscera, had declared the cause of death due to poison. The fact\nthat soon before her death Harbans Kaur was subjected to\ncruelty or harassment by appellant Tapinderpal Singh for or in\nconnection with any demand of dowry, is proved on record as is\nevident from the evidence led by the prosecution. Complainant\nKahan Singh (P.W.3) and Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4) have deposed\nthat Harbans Kaur (deceased) had been married with appellant\nTapinder Singh on 18.12.1994. The evidence of Kahan Singh\n(P.W.3) and Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4) is consistent about their\n-8-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nvisits to the village of appellant Tapinderpal Singh. Appellant\nTapinderpal Singh was running a Medical Store and had\ndemanded Rs.25,000/- from the parents of the deceased in order to\nexpand his business. The depositions of Kahan Singh (P.W.3)\nand Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4) establish without any doubt the\ncase of the prosecution against appellant Tapinderpal Singh.\nAppellant Tapinderpal Singh, as observed above, in his statement\nrecorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, has\ntaken the plea that the deceased was a beautiful lady whereas\nhe was a simpleton, hard of speaking and physically disabled;\nthat she was not happy to marry appellant Tapinderpal Singh and\nthat she used to remain in a sorrow mood. However, before\nthe marriage of Harbans Kaur with appellant Tapinderpal Singh,\nall these facts must have been brought to the notice of the\nparents of Harbans Kaur by the persons who had acted as\nintermediaries in arranging this marriage, but at no stage\nHarbans Kaur or her parents raised any objection. Ranbir Singh\nSarpanch (D.W.4) has disclosed the names of persons who had\nacted as intermediaries in arranging this marriage and they are\nJagdev Singh, Harbans Singh and Gian Singh of Village Talwandi.\nNone of these persons has been examined by appellant\nTapinderpal Singh. They were the best persons who could throw\nlight upon the circumstances whether it was a forced marriage or\nwhether the facts of appellant Tapinderpal Singh being stammering\nand simpleton were brought to the notice of Harbans Kaur and her\nparents prior to the marriage. Three photographs of appellant\n-9-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nTapinderpal Singh with deceased Harbans Kaur taken on the\noccasion of marriage are on record. One photograph depicts\nthe occasion of ring ceremony where the bride is putting ring\non the ring finger of the bridegroom. These photographs do not\nindicate that it was a forced marriage. The defence taken by\nappellant Tapinderpal Singh in this regard is an afterthought. The\nlife of Harbans Kaur came to an end by consuming some\npoisonous substance within two months of her marriage, which\nshows the magnitude of the harassment meted out to her by\nappellant Tapinderpal Singh. The above discussed evidence clearly\nestablishes that soon before Harbans Kaur ended her life, she\nwas subjected to cruelty by accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh\non account of demand of dowry. So, the third ingredient of the\noffence of  dowry death  i.e whether the deceased was subjected\nto cruelty or harassment soon before her death for or in connection\nwith dowry demands by accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh,\nstands proved from the evidence on record. \nFor the aforesaid reasons, the prosecution has been\nable to prove its case against accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh\nunder Section 304-B and 498-A of the Code. The impugned\njudgment of conviction recorded by the trial Court in respect of\nappellant Tapinderpal Singh is, therefore, upheld. The sentence\nimposed upon appellant Ram Sarup also commensurates with the\noffence committed by him. The impugned sentence order qua\nappellant Tapinderpal Singh is also, accordingly, upheld. \nThe net result is that this appeal qua appellants\n-10-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nAvtar Singh and Kartar Kaur is accepted, the impugned\njudgment of conviction and the sentence order qua them are set\naside and they are acquitted of the charge framed against them\nby giving them the benefit of doubt. However, this appeal qua\nappellant Tapinderpal Singh is dismissed. \n\nJanuary 21, 2010.\n\n ( MOHINDER PAL )\nak\n JUDGE"

JUSTICE SHAM SUNDER.\nPresent:\nSh.O.P.Goyal Sr.Adv., with \nMs.Pawanpreet Kaur Adv.\nFor the petitioner.\nNone for the respondent.\nJUDGMENT:\nThis revision petition is directed against the judgment\ndated 28.01.1991 rendered by the Appellate Authority (Additional\nDistt. Judge), Bhiwani vide which it dismissed the appeal against the\norder dated 29.09.1989 of the Rent Controller, Charkhi Dadri, fixing\nthe fair rent of the demised premises @ Rs.86/- including house tax\nw.e.f. 06.01.1988. \n.\nThe landlord/petitioner inducted the respondent, as a\ntenant in the demised premises as fully detailed, in the ejectment\napplication, at a monthly rental of Rs.78/- + house tax. The\nejectment of the respondent/tenant, was sought, on the ground, that\nhe had been in arrears of rent from. 01.11.1987 to 31.12.1987 +\nhouse tax, amounting to Rs.108/-. Prayer for fixation of fair rent,\nwas also made, on the ground that after 01.09.1982 when the fair\nrent, was earlier fixed, there has been an increase in the price index.\nAccordingly, a combined application under Sections 13 & 4 of\nHaryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973, was CIVIL\nWRIT PETITION NO.1436 OF 1991\n-2-\nfiled by the landlord/petitioner.\n.\nUpon notice, the respondent/tenant, put in\nappearance, and filed written statement, wherein, he admitted the\nrelationship of landlord and tenant. The rate of rent, at Rs.78/- per\nmonth (including house tax), was admitted. It was stated that the\narrears of rent, demanded by the landlord/petitioner, had already\nbeen paid by him. It was further stated that the fair rent of the shop\nin-question, at Rs.78/- per month, had already been fixed and there\nhad been no increase in the price index, and, thus, there was no\nquestion of fixing the fair rent again.\n.\nIn the replication, filed by the landlord/petitioner, he\nreiterated all the averments, contained in the petition and repudiated\nthose contained in the written statement.\n.\nOn the pleadings of the parties, the following issues\nwere struck, by the Rent controller:-\n.\nWhether the respondent is liable to be ejected \nfrom the premises indispute, as alleged? OPA\n.\nWhether there are grounds for the fixation of fair rent, \nif so at what rate ? OPA\n.\nWhether the applicant has no locus-standi to file the \napplication ? OPR\n.\nWhether the application is bad for non-joinder of \nnecessary parties ? OPR\n.\nRelief.\n.\nThe parties led documentary, as well as oral evidence,\nin support of their case. After hearing the Counsel for the parties,\nand on, going through the record of the case, the Rent Controller,\nfixed the fair rent at Rs.86/- (round figure) per month, w.e.f.\n.01.1988 including house tax. Since the Counsel for the\nlandlord/petitioner conceded that the respondent had paid the\narrears of rent, including cost and interest, no finding was recorded\non issue No.1, as the same was rendered redundant.\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.1436 OF 1991\n-3-\n.\nFeeling aggrieved, against the judgment dated\n.09.1989, the landlord preferred an appeal, which was dismissed\nby the Appellate Authority (Additional Distt. Judge), Bhiwani. \n.\nDissatisfied with the judgments of the Courts below,\nthe instant revision petition, was filed by the landlord/petitioner.\n.\nNotice of the petition, \n was given to the\nrespondent/tenant. Initially, Counsel for the respondent/tenant, put\nin appearance but, lateron none appeared on his behalf.\n.\nI have heard the Counsel for the petitioner and have\ngone through the record of the case carefully. \n.\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner contended that\nthe formula for fixing the fair rent, depicted in Section 4(2) of\nHaryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973, was\ninterpreted and approved by a Division Bench of this Court in\nYoginder Mohan Versus Krishan Lal 2000(1) PLR 788. It is to be\ndetermined, as to whether, the Courts below, fixed the fair rent in\naccordance with the formula, referred to above, and in consonance\nwith the principle of law laid down in Yoginder Mohan's case\n(supra). Admittedly, the basic rent, in this case, was Rs.78/- per\nmonth including house tax in the year 1982. The application, out of\nthe decision whereof, the instant revision petition has arisen, was\nfiled on 06.01.1988. The price index of the year 1982 was Rs.285.3\npaise and of the year 1987 i.e. one year preceding the filing of the\napplication was Rs.395.7. Under these circumstances, the\ndifference came to be Rs.110.4 or Rs.110/- (round figure). The\npercentage of difference, between the two figures of price index,\ncame to be Rs.38.69%. The Court could grant increase or decrease\nto the maximum of 25% under Section 4 (3) of the Act which came\nto be 9.67%. On this basis the increase in the fair rent came to be\nRs.7.54 (78/9.67x100). The \nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.1436 OF 1991\n-4-\nfair rent, therefore, came to be Rs.78+7.54 = Rs.85.54. The round\nfigure of fair rent, therefore, came to be Rs.86/- per month w.e.f.\n.01.1988 including house tax. The calculations were also\ndepicted by the Counsel for the revision petitioner, in a separate\nchart, which are in consonance with the decision rendered by the\nCourts below. The Courts below, in my opinion, rightly calculated\nthe fair rent, in accordance with the formula, referred to above, and\nthe principle of law, laid down, in Yoginder Mohan's case (Supra).\nThe judgments of the Lower Courts, therefore, do not suffer from\nany illegality or infirmity and, therefore, no interference is called for\ntherewith.\n.\nFor the reasons recorded hereinbefore, the revision-\npetition, is dismissed with no order as to costs.\nDecember 05, 2007\n(Sham Sunder)\nmamta m\n Judge"

In the present case,\non July 20, 1995, at a motion hearing, learned Bench passed the\nfollowing order:-\n Mr. K.S.Dadwal, Advocate\nHeard the learned counsel and perused\nthe impugned order. This revision is admitted qua\nCriminal Revision No. 497 of 1995 \nsentence only. The petitioner deserves to be\nadmitted to bail and is enlarged on bail subject to his\nfurnishing bail bonds to the satisfaction of the Chief\nJudicial Magistrate, Jalandhar.\n.7.1995\n(K.K.SRIVASTAVA)\nJUDGE \nSince the learned Judge after hearing the counsel and\nperusing the impugned order found not to interfere on the merits of the\ncase, the Court need not to dwell on the factual position of the case. \nMr. R.K.Dadwal has very fairly stated that due to the order\npassed at the motion hearing, he will confine his argument only on\nquantum of sentence. It has been stated before me that in the present\ncase, accident has taken place in the year 1991. A period of 17 years is\ngoing to lapse. From the head note of the trial Court judgement, the age\nof the petitioner is given as 32 years. Mr. Dadwal has stated that in the\nlast 17 years, petitioner has fastened himself with many liabilities of the\nfamily and children. Sending him behind the bars will cause stigma and\nwill have an affect on the marriage prospects of his children. It has been\nfurther stated at bar that petitioner, in the last 17 years, has committed\nno offence.\nHon ble the Apex Court has taken a view that in cases of\naccident, probation should not be granted. The petitioner is said to have\nundergone about one week behind the bars. His sentence from one year\nwas reduced to nine months by the learned Appellate Court in the year\n. For the last 13 years much water has flown. \nTaking protracted trial into consideration and fact that sending\nCriminal Revision No. 497 of 1995 \nthe petitioner behind the bars will serve no useful purpose, I deem it\nappropriate to compensate the family of the deceased by awarding a\nfine of Rs.50,000/-, which will be given as compensation to the legal\nheirs of the deceased. On deposit of Rs.50,000/-, the sentence of\npetitioner shall stand reduced to already undergone. Sentence of fine\nshall be deposited in the trial Court on 15.5.2008. Non-deposit of fine by\nthe petitioner will render this petition as dismissed.\nWith these modifications, the present revision petition is\ndisposed off.\n (Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\n Judge\nFebruary 14, 2008\n\n DK"

Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?\n\nPRESENT:\n Mr. Subhash Ahuja, Advocate,\n for the petitioner.\nMr. S. S. Pattar, Sr.DAG, Haryana,\nfor the State.\nNone for respondent Nos.3 to 8.\n****\nRANJIT SINGH, J. (ORAL)\nMr.Ahuja, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner is\napparently flogging a dead horse. The claim of the petitioner, who is\nno more, is not only pressed hard despite knowing that even two\nrespondents, against whom, he was claiming seniority, are also died.\nThe seniority claim of the late petitioner, which is being\npursued by his L.Rs, is made out the ground of his appointment in\nthe regular service. It appears that the petitioner as well as the\nrespondents were initially appointed as Computor in the pay scale of\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.14364 OF 1991 :{ 2 }:\nRs.110-225 in the Directorate of Land Records, Haryana. He joined\nthe duties on 18.9.1978. Subsequently, however, he was absorbed in\nthe respondent-office w.e.f 1.3.1979. Though the petitioner would\nmake reference to various Government notifications but the fact\nremains that he was regularised w.e.f 15.9.1982. Like him, the\nprivate respondents, except respondent No.6, were also regularised\nwith effect from 15.9.1982. The services of respondent No.6 were\nregularised on 1.4.1985. The grievance of the petitioner is that the\ndate of regularisation of the private respondents was subsequently\nchanged to 1.1.1980. \nThe counsel would contend that the petitioner was senior\nto the private respondents and on the basis of his seniority as\ndetermined in the seniority list issued, he was granted the selection\ngrade, which was allowed to 15% of the posts, in order of seniority.\nIn view of the subsequent change of date of regularisation of the\nprivate respondents to 1.1.1980, the petitioner became junior to the\nprivate respondents and accordingly the selection grade, which was\nallowed to him, was withdrawn. Accordingly, the payment which was\nmade to him, was also withdrawn. \nThe record would show that when the petitioner was\nshown senior to the private respondents, they had filed a civil suit,\nwhich was allowed. The petitioner not only filed an appeal against the\njudgment passed by the Civil Court but also filed present writ petition,\nwhich he claims to have filed prior to coming to know of the filing of\nCivil Court. Apparently, the petitioner has pursued two remedies. His\nappeal filed against the judgement rendered by the Trial Court was\nallowed only on the ground that he had challenged the seniority in\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.14364 OF 1991 :{ 3 }:\nthe writ petition. \nMr. Som Nath Saini, though is not representing the\nprivate respondents in the writ petition but is appearing for the\nappellant in connected S.A.O. No.22 of 1996, which is being\ndisposed of alongwith the present writ petition. On the basis of\nrecord of S.A.O as well as other Civil Writ Petition Nos.8002 of 1999\nand 21603 of 2008, Mr.Saini would point out that by no stretch of\nimagination, the petitioner would rank senior to the private\nrespondents. He would point out that the petitioner was appointed\nwith effect from 18.9.1978, whereas the private respondents were\nappointed as Computor on 1.12.1977. The petitioner was absorbed\nin the respondent-Department with effect from 1.3.1979 whereas the\nprivate respondents were so absorbed with effect from 1.1.1979. It is\nin view of this seniority that the private respondents were regularised\nwith effect from 1.1.1980 whereas the petitioner being junior to them\nwas so regularised with effect from 15.1.1982. Because of the\nseniority, the private respondents had prior right for regularisation on\ncompletion of two years of service and, thus, the policy dated\n.1.1980 was applicable for their regularisation. \nThe petitioner has no basis to make a claim of seniority\neither on the basis of date of appointment or on the date of\nregularisation or even on the basis of date of his absorption. Taking\nthe case from any angle, the private respondents always remained\nsenior to him and were so regularised on 1.1.1980. Otherwise also,\nthere is no issue left to be decided in this case in view of the death of\nthe petitioner as well as two of the respondents. The selection grade\nwas required to be granted on the basis of seniority to the 15% of the\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.14364 OF 1991 :{ 4 }:\nposts and accordingly this was rightly withdrawn from the petitioner. \nThere is, thus, no merit in the writ petition. The same is\naccordingly dismissed. However, since the petitioner was granted\nthis selection grade and he had not made any misrepresentation, the\nrecovery can not be effected from the L.Rs of the petitioner. \nThe consequence of this order would be that S.A.O No.22\nof 1996 filed by Charan Singh would have to be allowed and the\njudgment passed by the first Appellate Court shall stand reversed\nand the Trial Court order restored. It is so ordered.\nMay 10, 2010 \n\n( RANJIT SINGH )\nkhurmi\n\n JUDGE"

Saini, Advocate\nfor the petitioners.\nMs. Lisa Gill, Advocate \nfor the respondents.\n****\nK. Kannan, J (oral).\n.\nThe writ petitioners who were Junior Assistants\nposted as Readers in the subordinate judiciary challenge the reduction of\npay scales and recoveries sought to be made when through the\nproceedings of the Government of Punjab, Department of Finance,\nnotification issued on 19.5.1998, the government had decided to amend\nthe Second Schedule to the Punjab Civil Service Revised Pay First\nAmendment Rules of 1998. The amendment was issued to take effect from\n.1.1996 retrospectively.\n.\nThe petitioners' complaint is that they had been\nworking as ministerial staff as Senior Clerks and Junior Assistants who\nwere put on time scale of Rs.1500-2700 and after 1.1.1996 the scales had\nbeen revised and assigned to the scale of Rs.5000-8100. By the impugned\nproceedings through an office order dated 13.9.1999, the junior assistants\nwere put in the time scale of Rs.4400-7000 w.e.f. 1.1.1996. This resulted in\na reduction of scale of pay for persons who had drawn a higher pay when\nCWP No.14922 of 1999\nthe scales were revised to 5000-8100. When the revision of scales had\ntaken place, it was reduced from Rs.5000-8100 to 4400-7000 and no pay\nprotection had been given to them unlike other classes of persons to whom\nsuch protection was given. According to the petitioner the retrospective\nreduction of scale without protecting the pay which they were drawing was\narbitrary. It also discriminated when certain other classes of persons, who\nlike the Duplicating Machine Operators, belonging to the operational staff\nhad been given pay protection when the scale of pay had been reduced.\nSimilarly even in the National Training Institute the craft instructors were\ngiven pay protection by applying it uniformly to all persons, whether\npromoted before or after 1.1.1996.\n.\n All the petitioners are persons who had been\npromoted after 1.1.1996 and who had obtained the higher revised scale but\nwhen the revision of scale had been made to a lower scale the higher\nsalary drawn was not protected. Learned counsel for the petitioner refers\nto a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chairman Railway Board\nand others Vs. C.R. Rangadhamaiah and others (1997) 6 SCC 623 that\ndealt with the case of effect of retrospective amendment withdrawing\nvested or accrued rights of government employees. The Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt held that any retrospective amendment which has the effect of taking\naway an accrued right of an employee would be liable to be struck down.\nLearned counsel also refers to a situation of 10 other employees similarly\nplaced, who were working as Junior Assistants in various other\ndepartments like Colleges in U.T.Administration, Chandigarh and who\nwere afforded the pay protection while retrospective application of scale of\npay was sought to be made through an intervention of order of the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal in OA No. 316/CH/2001 by its order dated\n.3.2003. According to him, the petitioners could not have any relief\nbefore CAT only because they were members of the judiciary and therefore\nCWP No.14922 of 1999\nthey have sought relief before this Court and they should also enjoy the\nsame relief as the persons similarly situated.\n.\nThe office order, while reducing the scales of pay\nto Rs.4400-7000 against the existing scale of Rs.5000-8100 could not have\nrestricted the benefit of pay protection only to persons who had been\npromoted even before 1.1.1996. If the revision of pay scales had not been\nbrought immediately on 1.1.1996 and all the petitioners had been provided\nfor higher scales from 1.1.1996 an office order that was brought on\n.9.1999 could not deny such protection to persons who had been\npromoted subsequently on 1.1.1996 and who had received the higher\nscales. The revised scale of Rs.4400-7000 should be applied only after\nproviding for protection of salary at the scale which they were drawing.\nAccordingly, the impugned office order under Annexure P-1 is quashed.\n.\nThe writ petition is allowed with protection granted\nas aforesaid. There shall, however, be no order as to costs.\n(K. KANNAN)\n JUDGE \nDecember 15 , 2009\narchana"

JUSTICE DR. BHARAT BHUSHAN \nPARSOON\n***\n.\n Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the\n judgment?\n. \nTo be referred to the Reporters or not?\n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?\n***\nPresent:\nShri Sumeet Sangwan,Advocate, for \nShri Harish Rathee, Advocate, for the petitioner.\nNone for the respondent.\n***\nDR.BHARAT BHUSHAN PARSOON, J\nIn this Civil Writ petition filed under Articles 226/227 of the\nConstitution of India, the petitioner has sought a writ in the nature of\nMandamus or any other writ or orders against the respondent-M.D.\nUniversity (hereinafter to be referred to as the  respondent-University ),\nto consider his case for promotion to the post of Assistant with effect from\nthe date, his juniors were promoted, along with other consequential\nbenefits. Direction was also sought against the respondent-University for\nplacing the petitioner at serial No. 261 above Shri Rajbir Singh, in the\nseniority list, taking into account the date of joining of the petitioner on\nCWP 1545 of 92\nthe post of Clerk on ad hoc basis.\nClaim of the petitioner is that the petitioner was appointed as\nClerk on adhoc basis on 25.3.1983 , vide letter (Annexure P-1). His\nservices were regularized on the said post vide order dated 10.11.1983\n( Annexure P-2). Taking the wrong date of appointment of the petitioner\nas a regular clerk i.e 28.11.1983, he was placed at serial No. 330 in the\nseniority list and for this reason he was not promoted as Assistant.\nFurther claim of the petitioner is that in fact he joined his duties on\n.3.1983 and thus he should have been placed at serial No. 261 in the\nseniority list. It is averred that the petitioner was wrongly not promoted as\nAssistant and even his representation (Annexure P-7) for assigning\nappropriate place in the seniority list, was not considered.\nIn addition, the petitioner has claimed that the respondent-\nUniversity violated its own service rules for non-teaching employees. It is\nalso claimed that the petitioner was treated differently though he was\nsimilarly situated with other employees, whose services rendered on\nadhoc basis were counted towards their probation period but the same\nbenefit was denied to the petitioner.\nThe stand of the respondent-University on the contrary is\nthat no right much less statutory, has been infringed. It has been\nexplained that the petitioner was initially appointed as a Clerk purely on\nadhoc basis and for a period of six months and that too subject to\ncompliance of certain conditions with effect from 26.3.1983 and had been\ngiven extension from time to time. One of the conditions contained in the\nletter of appointment was that the petitioner has to qualify the written test\nas well as typing test in English at a speed of 30 words per minute. \nCWP 1545 of 92\nOn his passing the written test, services of the petitioner\nwere regularized by the University with effect from 22.11.1983 but, he\nwas further required to pass the type test. Later on, when he could not\nqualify the type test, relaxing this condition, on expiry of two years of his\nprobation period, he was confirmed with effect from 28.11.1985. It is\nclaimed that service rendered by the petitioner on adhoc basis, thus ,\ncannot be counted towards his seniority. \nIt has also been explained that before preparing the final\nseniority list, in May 1988 objections were invited from the concerned\nofficials within 10 days of the issue of the circular, with clear stipulation\nthat in absence of any objections raised within the stipulated period, the\nseniority list will be treated as final and that since the petitioner had not\nraised any objection, it was finalized thereafter. Qua claim of the\npetitioner that other non-teaching employees promoted as Assistants\nwere given the benefits of adhoc service in counting their service period,\nit is clarified that they had been appointed on regular basis without any\nrider or conditions attached to their appointment, which was not the case\nof the petitioner, as he was required to qualify the written examination as\nalso the typing test. In short, the University had claimed that the\npetitioner had correctly been placed in the seniority list according to the\nRules of the University. Prayer for dismissal of the petition was made.\nSince, there is no representation on behalf of the\nrespondent-University in this petition and the matter is of 1992, instead of\nadjourning the case for the appearance of the counsel for respondent-\nUniversity, it is considered appropriate to dispose of the matter after\nhearing learned counsel for the petitioner.\nCWP 1545 of 92\nI have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused\nthe documents placed on the record.\nIn the seniority list issued by the respondent-University name\nof the petitioner is appearing at serial No. 330, taking the date as\n.11.1983 i.e the date of his regularization. No doubt, pursuant to his\nappointment on adhoc basis, the petitioner had joined his duties on\n.3.1983 but the said period of service rendered on adhoc basis was\nnot counted towards the period of regularization.\nThe reason is not far to seek. It is rather revealed that the\npetitioner was appointed on 25.3.1983 purely on adhoc basis for a\nperiod of six months on the post of a clerk and he joined on 26.03.1983\nand was required to qualify the prescribed written test as well as typing\ntest in English and further his services were liable to be terminated at any\ntime without any notice.\n Accepting these conditions contained in the appointment\nletter dated 25.3.1983, the petitioner joined his duties on 26.3.1983. Vide\nletter dated 10.11.1983, services of the petitioner were ordered to be\nregularized, subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions contained\ntherein which included  Verification of character and antecedents as also\nproduction of medical fitness Certification from a competent authority .\nOn the fulfillment of said conditions, services of the petitioner were\nregularized with effect from 22.11.1983 i.e the date on which the said\nconditions had been fulfilled by the petitioner.\nNotwithstanding regularization of services of the petitioner\nwith effect from 22,12,1983 (as per communication of 25.10.1984), the\npetitioner was required to pass the type test in English at the speed of 30\nCWP 1545 of 92\nwords per minutes before being considered for confirmation on\ncompletion of probation period of one year which was to be counted with\neffect from 22.11.1983. Despite the extension of period of probation, the\npetitioner had failed to qualify the requisite type test from time to time, till\nthe expiry of period of two years of probation and even thereafter.\nShowing benevolent mercy, the respondent-University\nrelaxed the condition of passing of typing test and after completion of\nthe extended period of probation of two years, the petitioner was\nconfirmed as a Clerk.\nFrom the factual matrix as discussed earlier, it is clear that\npassing of the typing test was a condition precedent for regularization.\nCoupled with character verification and antecedents as also production of\nmedical fitness certificate, without waiting for the passing of requisite\ntyping test, services of the petitioner were regularized vide letter dated\n.10.1984 (Annexure P-3). Since the petitioner was required to qualify\nthe typing test during the period of probation one year, on his failure to do\nso his services were to be terminated automatically on this ground. \nCondition No.3 of letter dated 25.10.1984 (Annexure P-3) is\nextracted as under:-\n You will, therefore, be on probation\nfor a period of one year in the first instance and\nthe probation will be counted with effect from\n.11.1983. You will, however, have to qualify the\ntype test in English at the speed of 30 words per\nminutes before you are considered for\nconfirmation on the completion of your\nprobationary period. In the event of your failure\nto qualify the type test, your services may stand\nterminated automatically on this ground .\nThe University instead of terminating services of the\nCWP 1545 of 92\npetitioner for his failure to qualify the typing test, provided him\nsustenance and support by relaxing the condition of passing of typing test\nbut the petitioner instead of showing his gratitude towards the University\nhas raised his accusing finger at the respondent and that too without any\nbasis.\nStand of the University that the seniority list was prepared on\nthe basis of date of joining of the concerned employees on regular post,\nand that too after considering the objections from the concerned officials,\ncould not be assailed by the learned counsel for the petitioner.\nThus, it is clear that adhering to the Service Rules, the\nUniversity had acted fairly and had rather relaxed the condition of\npassing of the typing test when the petitioner had not been able to qualify\nthe said test even during the extended period of probation of two years.\nIn fact this large hearted approach of the University had attributed\ntowards the retention of the petitioner in service otherwise in terms of\n(extracted earlier), the petitioner was to be off the job.\nAs far as counting of adhoc service rendered by the\npetitioner is concerned, when the petitioner had not been able to qualify\nthe requisite typing test (which was a condition precedent), he was\nneither eligible to be appointed as a clerk nor was to be retained in\nservice. The period of adhoc service of the petitioner could not be\ncounted towards the probation period. Stand of the petitioner that he has\nwrongly been placed at serial No. 330 in the seniority list, taking the date\nof his joining the post of clerk inter-alia on regular basis (i.e after\ncomplying with the other requisite conditions), is without any substance.\nWhen clerks other than the petitioner, were promoted as Assistants in\nCWP 1545 of 92\nterms of their seniority viz-a-viz from the date of joining regular service,\nthey cannot be considered juniors to the petitioner. \nLooking from another angle, the petitioner was regularized\non the post of a clerk vide letter dated 25.10.1984 with effect from\n.11.1983 ignoring the service rendered by him on adhoc basis and only\nafter counting the regular service rendered by the petitioner, he was\nconfirmed as a clerk with effect from 28.11.1985 vide communication\ndated 22.3.1986. He, however filed the present writ petition only on\n.1.1992. Thus, there is long delay in filing the petition revealing that\nthe petitioner had been in long slumber.\nConsequently, when the petitioner has not been able to show\nviolation of any Service Rules and when his appointment was on adhoc\nbasis, dehors the Rules and was subject to the condition of qualifying the\nwritten examination as also of passing of requisite type test in English,\nthe respondent University was right in excluding the period of adhoc\nservice for determination of the seniority. It was also so held in 2001(3)\nRSJ 15 (SC)- State of Punjab and others Vs. Gurdeep Kumar Uppal\nand others; 2000(4) RSJ 167 (SC)- State of Haryana Vs. Haryana\nVeterinary and A.H.T.S. Asson and another and Civil Appeal No.\nof 2012 (arising out of SLP   No. 29274 of 2009) State of\nHaryana and others Vs. Vijay Singh and others.\nAs a result of above discussion the writ petition is without\nany merit and is dismissed.\nJuly 8, 2013\n (DR.BHARAT BHUSHAN PARSOON)\nMalik \n JUDGE"

    "judgment_text": "Crl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[1]\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT\nCHANDIGARH\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\nDate of decision: 17.10.2007\nRaghbir Singh \nPetitioner\nVersus\nState of Haryana \nRespondent\nCoram:\nHon'ble Mr. Justice Harbans Lal\nPresent:\nMr. Ajay Kansal, Advocate for the revisionist.\nMr.PS Sullar, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana\nHarbans Lal, J.\nThis revision is directed against the judgment dated 5.2.1992\nrendered by the Court of Shri Darshan Singh, Judicial Magistrate Ist Class,\nHisar, whereby he convicted and sentenced the revision petitioner to\nundergo RI for a period of six months and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- or in\ndefault thereof to further undergo RI for a period one and half month, as\nwell as judgment dated 8.7.1994 rendered by the learned Additional\nSessions Judge, Hisar vide which the period of substantive sentence\ninflicted by the learned trial Court has been reduced from 6 months rigorous\nimprisonment to three months rigorous imprisonment maintaining the\namount of fine of Rs.1000/- as well as its default clause.\nAs set up by the prosecution, the revisionist- Raghbir Singh is a\nbus conductor in the employment of Haryana Roadways and is posted in the\nOffice of General Manager, Haryana Roadways, Hisar (hereinafter to be\nreferred as   the G.M. ). On 30.6.1990 he was entrusted with bus fare\ntickets of the value of Rs. 27584/- for being issued to the passengers. He\ndid not deposit the tickets nor the sale proceeds thereof. Thereupon, the\nG.M. sent a letter Ex.PW3/A to S.H.O., Police Station City Hisar on\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[2]\n.7.1990. On its basis, FIR Ex.PW5/A was recorded. The revisionist was\nplaced under suspension vide order dated 12.9.1990. He put in his\nappearance before the G.M. on 12.11.1990 and explained his absence from\n.7.1990 to 13.11.1990. The latter sanctioned earned leave to the\nrevisionist for the aforesaid period vide order dated 21.11.1990 (copy\nEx.D2) and ordered his reinstatement w.e.f. 14.11.1990. He deposited a sum\nof Rs. 25052/- on 5.10.1990.\nMr. Ajay Kansal, Advocate appearing for the revisionist has\nstrenuously urged that as emanates from the evidence produced in defence,\nthe revisionist remained at rest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and on leave from\n.7.1990 to 30.11.1990, which leave no scope for doubt that he never\nremained on duty after 30.6.1990 and as its consequence, there was no\noccasion for him to sell the tickets. He further puts that he deposited\nRs.25402/- as well as the unsold tickets in the office of the G.M. on\n.10.1990 and in turn, the latter had written a letter for withdrawal of the\ncase and in these premises, no criminal offence is made out against the\nrevisionist. \nHe further submits that in view of the legal position laid down\nin re: State of Punjab vs. Amarjit Singh, 1992(1) Recent Criminal\nReports, 619, the courts below have gravely erred in recording the\nconviction of the petitioner.\nThe next argument raised by the counsel appearing for the\nrevisionist is that the prosecution has utterly failed to prove by leading any\nevidence on the file that the tickets issued to the revisionist on 30.6.1990 \nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[3]\nwere sold by him and in the absence of the same, no criminal offence under\nSection 409 of the Indian Penal Code is made out. He further added to it\nthat as transpires from the evidence trickled from the respective mouths of\nthe prosecution witnesses, the revisionist was not on duty and was on\nrest/leave from 1.7.1990 till 13.11.1990 and these circumstances lead to the\nonly inference that after 30.6.1990 he never remained on duty. \nTo tide over these submissions Mr. PS Sullar, Deputy Advocate\nGeneral, Haryana has maintained that the said amount was deposited by the\nrevisionist after registration of the case and as would be apparent from the\nevidence, revisionist got manipulated the sanction of his leave and thus, it\nwould be going too far to say that the charged offence is not established\nagainst the revisionist.\nI have given a deep and thoughtful consideration to the rival\nsubmissions. In Amarjit Singh's case (supra), on 29.4.1982, Amarjit\nSingh, who was working as a Conductor in Pepsu Road Transport\nCorporation, (for short 'PRTC') absented himself from his duty with a sum\nof Rs.3254.55 of PRTC, Kapurthala. The case was got registered against\nhim. The Division Bench of this Court was pleased to observe as under :\n After accepting the deposit of Rs. 2804/- from the\nrespondent on August 17,1982, it does not lie in the\nmouth of Pepsu Road Transport Corporation to urge\nthat the charge of criminal breach of trust against the\naccused in respect of allegedly misappropriated amount\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[4]\n still subsists. Regarding failure of the accused to return\nthe unsold tickets it has been held by the Supreme Court\nin Sardar Singh vs. State of Haryana, AIR 1977 Supreme\nCourt 1766 that merely failure or omission to return\nproperty does not constitute an offence under Section\nof the Indian Penal Code, Relevant observations\nread, what the section requires is something much more\nthan mere failure or omission to return the receipt book,\nThe prosecution has to go further and show that the\nappellant dishonestly misappropriated or converted the\nreceipt book to his own use or dishonestly used or,\ndisposed of it. That, we are afraid, the prosecution has\nnot been able to do in the present case. We are,\ntherefore, of the view that the appellant was wrongly\nconvicted under Section 409. Finding of not guilty\nreturned by the learned trial court is, therefore,\naffirmed. \nTo my mind, the case in hand is manifestly covered by Amarjit\nSingh's case (supra). A glance through Ex.D1 would reveal that an amount\nof Rs. 25402/- was deposited by the revisionist on 5.10.1990 with the\nconcerned authority of Haryana Roadways. As per Ex.D1/A the tickets\nbox as well as the value of the sold tickets were deposited on the said date\nby the revisionist. As emerges out of Ex.D2, another order, earned leave\nwas sanctioned for the period from 16.7.1990 to 13.11.1990 in favour of the\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[5]\nrevisionist by the competent authority. As revealed by Ex.D4, he was on\nrest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and on leave from 5.7.1990 to 15.7.1990.\nThis official record is a clincher towards the fact that the revisionist\nremained on rest from 1.7.1990 to 4.7.1990 and thereafter he proceeded on\nearned leave which has been duly sanctioned by the competent authority.\nThe prosecution has not adduced any cogent, convincing and clear evidence\nleading to the conclusion that right from 1.7.1990 onwards, he remained on\nduty and had sold the tickets of Bus fare. It is own evidence of the\ncomplainant in the form of above discussed documents that the revisionist\nwas on rest/leave during the above mentioned period. If so, how he could be\nexpected to have sold the tickets. It is probable that when the revisionist\nlearnt about the registration of case against him, he on some advice\ndeposited the amount of Rs.25402/- alongwith tickets to save his job. As\nalready noticed, there is no evidence regarding sale of tickets by the\nrevisionist. He could have sold the tickets only to the Bus passengers. The\nprosecution has not produced any evidence as to on which Bus he was a\nconductor when he sold tickets. The revisionist after registration of the case\nmight had apprehended his suspension and arrest in the case. To get rid of\nthe same he might have thought to return some tickets and cash in lieu of\nthe other tickets. \nIn re: Pushpa Kumar Rai v. State of Sikkim 1978 Criminal\nLaw Journal, 1379, their Lordships were pleased to observe that even if it is\nassumed that the accused had collected the amount, the offence did not fall\nunder Section 409 of the Indian Penal Code which deals with breach of trust\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[6]\n by public servants and others. It was remarked as under:-\n In this case, therefore, even assuming that the accused\nwas a conductor of the Bus of the Sikkim Nationalised\nTransport as alleged and in such capacity collected bus\nfares amounting to Rs. 2826.60p. as alleged or any other\namount and failed to deposit the said amount, the\naccused can never be said to have been entrusted with\nthat amount because the said amount was never 'made\nover' or 'transferred' or 'handed over', to the accused by\nanyone on behalf of the Sikkim Nationalised Transport.\nIt also appears that in the charge itself the learned\nSessions Judge did not state that the accused was\nentrusted with any amount but only stated that the\naccused was  entrusted with collecting the bus fares . I\nam afraid that being entrusted with the doing of a job is\nnot the same thing as being entrusted with any property\nwithin the meaning of S. 405 and other congnate\nSections of the I.P.C. even though some money or other\nproperty may come into the hand of the person in the\ncourse of his doing such job. That being so, I am of the\nopinion that there was absolutely no material on record\nto frame a charge under S.409 against the accused. And\nif the charge framed was such as could not be framed on\nthe materials on record, a plea of guilty to such a charge\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[7]\n is no plea in the eye of law and cannot be relied on by\nany Court, as the basis of any conviction. The learned\nSessions Judge was, therefore, wrong in convicting the\naccused on the basis of his plea to the charge as framed\nby him and the order of conviction and sentence passed\nby him must, therefore, be set aside \nIn re: Sardar Singh v. State of Haryana (1977) 1 Supreme\nCourt Cases 463, their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court were\npleased to observe as under:\n An essential ingredient of the offence under Section 405\nis that the accused being in any manner entrusted with\nproperty or with dominion over property, dishonestly\nmisappropriates or converts to his own used that\nproperty or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property\nin violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode\nin which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal\ncontract, express or implied, which he has made\ntouching the discharge of such trust.\nSection 409 can be invoked only if it can be shown that\nthe accused being in any manner entrusted with property\nor with dominion over property in his capacity as public\nservant committed criminal breach of trust in respect of\nthat property. It requires something much more than\nmere failure or omission to return the property.\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[8]\nIn the present case, the prosecution has not been able to\nshow that the accused dishonestly misappropriated or\nconverted the property to his own use or dishonestly\nused or disposed of it. Hence the conviction under\nSection 409 cannot stand. \nReverting back to the facts of the instant case, the prosecution\nhas not inducted any evidence to the effect that the revisionist had\ndishonestly misappropriated or converted the tickets to his own use or\ndisposed of the alleged entrusted property in violation of any direction of\nlaw. There being dearth of such evidence, the offence is not established in\nview of the observations recorded in re: Sardar Singh's case (supra).\nIn re: Harbhajan Lal vs. State of Punjab, 1984 (1) Recent\nCriminal Reports (Criminal) 567, the bus conductor had failed to return the\nunused tickets. The case under Section 409 of the Code was got registered\nagainst him. There was no evidence to the effect that the accused had sold\nthe tickets and realized the amount. The Division Bench of this Court in\nthese circumstances was pleased to hold that no case of misappropriation is\nmade out unless there is a clear evidence that accused had realized the\namount. Adverting to the facts of the current case, the defence evidence\nnullifies the prosecution case. Had the revisionist worked during the\ninterregnum of 1.7.1990 to 13.11.1990, his rest/leave might had not been\nsanctioned. At the cost of repetition, it deserves to be pointed out here that,\nif he had worked on any Bus during the said period, the prosecution might\nhad got proved the way bill of such Bus. Only then it\n\nCrl.Revn.No. 402 of 1994\n[9]\ncould have been inferred that he had the occasion to sell the tickets. Thus,\nthe prosecution evidence falls short of proof regarding the sale of the tickets\nby the revisionist. \nThe approach of a Court to very lightly brush aside the defence\nwitnesses cannot be approved. After all they are also the witnesses who\nappear in the Court to prove the defence and make the statements on oath.\nThe burden to prove the defence is not as heavy on the defence as it is on\nthe prosecution. the prosecution is required to esatblish its case beyond\nevery shadow of doubt, but the accused is only required to show to the\nCourt that the defence raised by him may not be fool proof, but is probable\nand plausible. If the Court is of the opinion that the defence appears to be\nreasonable and probable, then the Court is not entitled to reject the\nstatements of the witnesses. ( See Janggu alias Shobhit and others v.\nState of Madhya Pradesh, 2000 Criminal Law Journal 711 ).\nComing to the facts of the case in hand, the defence evidence,\nas noted supra, in the form of documents is probable, plausible and\nreasonable. Rather, the same knocks down the prosecution edifice. Thus,\nplacing abundant reliance upon the same, it is held that the prosecution case\ncollapses like a house of cards and sequelly, this revision succeeds and is\naccepted, setting aside the judgments of the Courts below and the\nrevisionist-petitioner is hereby acquitted of the charge. \nth October, 2007\n(HARBANS LAL)\ngsv\n JUDGE"

No. 3550 of 1990\n Date of decision: 9.11.2011 \nRisal Singh and others\n\n ..Petitioners\n\nVersus\nThe State of Haryana and others\n ..Respondents\nCoram: Hon ble the Acting Chief Justice\n Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajiv Narain Raina\nPresent:\nMr. Arun Jain, Sr. Advocate\nwith Mr. Amit Jain, Advocate \nfor the petitioners.\nMr. Kamal Sehgal, Addl. A.G.Haryana\nfor the respondents.\n..\n. To be referred to the reporters or not? \n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the \n digest?\nRajiv Narain Raina,J.\n.\nThe present petition filed under Articles 226/227 along with five\nconnected petitions*, are directed against the land acquisition notification No.\nLAC(G)-88/97 dated 26.12.1988 under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition\nAct,1894 and the declaration vide notification No. LAC (G)/NTLA-89/150 dated\n.12.1989 under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, the\n ACT ). Before we deal with the notifications under challenge in these petitions, it\nwould be apposite to narrate in brief a few material facts prior to the notification\nunder challenge which have bearing on the present case as culled from CWP\nNo.3550 of 1990- Risal Singh and others v. The State of Haryana and others.\n.\nOn 4.11.1981, State Government had issued a notification under\nSection 4 for acquisition of land in dispute covering a total area of 812.12 acres\nwhich included the land of the petitioners and the petitioners in the connected\npetitions. The public purpose for that acquisition was to develop the land for\nresidential area carving out Sectors 1, 2 and 3 at Rohtak. Subsequently, the\ndeclaration under Section 6 was issued on 24.2.1984. Since both the notifications\nwere prior to the 1984 amendment of the Act, it was legal and valid then to issue\na declaration under Section 6 up to 3 years from the date of Section 4 notification.\nIt appears that the land owners then represented to the Chief Minister, Haryana\nagainst the acquisition. It is stated in para 7 of the petition that the Chief Minister\nhad acceded to the request of the land owners and directed that the land on\nwhich residential buildings/houses of the petitioners had been constructed should\nnot be acquired. This decision of the Chief Minister was conveyed to the Director,\nTown and Country Planning, Haryana who further conveyed the order to Director,\nUrban Estates, Haryana and the matter was dropped and Section 6 notification\nwas allowed to lapse with effect from 23.9.1986 (P-3 dated 19.9.1986) with the\ncondition that fresh notification under Section 4 may be issued after holding an\ninquiry in consultation with the District Town Planner following a meeting held on\n.7.1996. It was decided vide Annexure P-4 dated 24.9.1986 that if it is found\nthat land lying vacant has been sold in the shape of plots and it does not fit in the\nplanning of HUDA, in that case, it will be of no use to notify the same for\nacquisition. It was also a stipulation that a clear report be submitted as to how\nmany houses had already been constructed in the area and to identify the owners\nof the lands which were then lying vacant.\n.\nSince no fresh notification was issued after lapse of the first\nacquisition the petitioners aver that they remained sanguine that their land would\nremain in their use and ownership and with that implied assurance many land\nowners raised further constructions on their land involving huge expenditure. This\nis where the first chapter of the story ends. \n.\nAll of a sudden, State Government issued a fresh notification under\nSection 4 dated 26.12.1988 again setting in motion the process of acquisition of\nthe land upon which large number of constructions in the shape of residential\nbuildings existed. The petitioners filed objections under Section 5-A praying that\ntheir constructions be left out. It is stated that on the date of the second Section 4\nnotification for acquisition of 479.84 acres, there were approximately 300 built up\nhouses in the area in question and that any move to acquire the land would\nresound in a humanitarian problem which would lead to enmass uprooting rural\nfolk including the petitioners who had made the area their homestead prior to the\nnotification under Section 4. The public purpose of the acquisition was to utilize\nthe land for residential and commercial areas falling in Sector 3, Rohtak under\nthe HUDA Act, 1977 by HUDA in the area of village Bohar HB 68 Tehsil and\nDistrict Rohtak. The objections of the land owners including the petitioners did not\nfind favour with the Land Acquisition Officer and the Section 6 notification came\nto be issued on 22.12.1988 declaring an area of 317.47 acres was required for\nacquisition in which the land/buildings of the petitioners fell. Since the notification\nunder Section 4 of the Act was for 479.84 acres, the declaration under Section 6\nwas issued qua 317.47 Acres, therefore about 150 acres was left out of the\nacquisition. This lacuna was sought to be filled by the State Government by\nissuing a corrigendum notification dated 8.3.1990 where 317. 47 acres was\nincreased to 367.47 acres. In this manner about 50 acres was added in which the\nland and houses of the petitioners was situated. In the affidavit filed by Satbir\nSingh, Land Acquisition Collector, Urban Estate, Haryana in compliance of this\nCourt s order dated 11.7.2011, it has been stated that 33 land owners namely,\nDaya Singh and others had represented to the Director, Urban Estates on\n.3.1990 that their residential houses on the land owned by them if acquired\nwould be to their detriment and cause undue hardship. The request of the land\nowners was approved by the Government on 17.4.1990. It has been further\nstated in the affidavit that a total land measuring 26.99 and 6.91 acres has been\nwithdrawn under Section 48 of the Act vide notification dated 22.6.1990 and\n.4.1992 being the land which was notified under Section 6. In the affidavit, the\ndetails of Rectangle, Killa and Khasra numbers has been set out as also the\nname of persons whose land stood released after completion of the process of\nacquisition. It is relevant to notice that award No. 4 dated 29.3.1990 and award\nNo.18 dated 25.3.1991 had come into existence. A map of the area has been\nannexed showing substantial area of 26.99 acres of land released on 17.4.1990\nafter passing of the awards left out after Section 5-A notification and the\nsubstantial area of 6.91 acres which was also released. The petitioner filed Civil\nMisc. No. 8701 of 2011 in the present proceedings pointing out that the area in\nquestion is by now a developed colony where various amenities stood provided\nby the respondent-authorities. It has been further pointed out that area of some\nland owners has been released who did not even choose to file objections under\nsection 5-A. A letter of the Director, Urban Estates Department, Haryana to the\nEstate Officer, HUDA dated 27.8.1983 has been placed on record (P-13) that 4\nmarlas of land comprised in Khasra No. 173//9/2 had been decided to be\nreleased as there was construction of Samadhi, Havan Kund, Piao and Sat Sang\nHall on the land. Another letter dated 17.3.1988 (P14) of the District Town\nPlanner, Rohtak to State Town Planner, Hissar deals with a request of 68\nresidents of the disputed area in Sector 3 who had represented to the Minister,\nTown and Country Planning Department, Haryana consequent upon which the\nmatter was  studied  and a detailed report is contained in this letter. It was\nreported that the constructions of the 68 land owners was not in a compact block\nbut in different khasra numbers, that is, approximately in all the khasra numbers\nand the adjoining area had already been released from acquisition by HUDA. It\nhas been noticed that this area in question is also under writ proceedings since\nlong and no lay out plan of this area had been drawn. Therefore, a\nrecommendation was made to the Government to consider release of land from\nacquisition. A similar request was recommended for release vide letter dated\n.6.2006 (P15) from District Town Planner, Rohtak to the Administrator, HUDA,\nHissar for release of land of one Shri Surat Singh Nandal.\n.\nMr. Arun Jain learned Senior Counsel unfolded before us the facts of\nthe case and argued that this was eminently a fit case for quashing the impugned\nnotifications under sections 4 and 6 of the Act. He brought to our notice the\ncontents of para 14 of the writ petition, which read as under:-\n  That subsequently a large parcel of land which was covered\nunder residential houses could not be utilized for planned\ndevelopment of Sector 3 was left out. This land included the land of\nthe petitioners mentioned above. A notification was prepared in the\noffice and was sent for publication to the Government Press. Under\nthis notification, land measuring 317.47 acres of land was to be\nacquired and to be included in the Section\nof the Act's\nnotification. However, for extraneous and irrational reasons, the\nnotification sent for publication was recalled by the respondents and\n.3 acres of additional land was added with pen on the notification\nto be sent for publication to the press. The area sought to be\nacquired reflected in Section 6 notification, therefore, increased to\n.50 acres but since the numbers were subsequently added, as\nsuch, the notification still reflects area in acres in column No.4 as\n.47 Acres. \n.\nIn the written statement filed by Mr. R.K. Kazal, Land Acquisition\nCollector, Urban Estates, Haryana, Hissar on behalf of the respondent-State,\nthere is a damaging admission, which reads as follows:-\n That para No.14 of the writ petition is wrong and hence\ndenied. It is submitted that the total acquired land under Section 6\nwas 367.50 acres but it was wrongly published the area 317.47 acres\nwhich was rectified vide corrigendum No. LAC(G)-90/NTLA/187 dated\n.3.90. It is further submitted that those khasra numbers measuring\nland 50.3 acres were not typed and were added with pen. \n.\nIn the circumstances, we called for the original record of the\nnotification under Section 6 dated 22.12.1989. On perusal of the original record,\nwe were confronted with numerous hand written entries of khasra numbers which\nare undated and unsigned. On the last page on the left margin of the notification\nit is only the typed part which is signed by the Joint Secretary to Government of\nHaryana, Urban Estates Department Haryana, Chandigarh. Learned senior\ncounsel submitted that the land of his clients was roped in into acquisition by this\nillegal and unlawful process. Government can speak only in writing, formally and\nby notifications. The land acquisition law being ex-proprietary, it deserves strict\nconstruction. We find merit in the submission and the view canvassed by him is\nlegally sound that the notification under section 6 deserves to be quashed.\n.\nMr. Kamal Sehgal, learned Additional Advocate General, Haryana\nwas at a loss to explain the authenticity and genuineness of the hand written\nkhasra/khewat numbers on the left margin of the notification or who was its\nauthor. \n.\nMr. Arun Jain learned Senior Advocate read the substantive\nprovision contained in Section 6 of the Act that when any particular land is\nneeded for a public purpose,  declaration shall be made to that effect under\nthe signature of a Secretary to such Government or of some officer duly\nauthorized to certify its orders.  The hand written parts on the last page of the\nnotification does not stand the test of Section 6 and cannot be taken as a part of\nit, especially when no corresponding noting regarding insertion of Khasra\nnumbers in question have been produced signed by the Secretary or any\nauthorized delegate of the Government. The precious rights of land owners\ncannot be defeated by sleight of hand. Learned senior counsel next argued that\nthe lands of similarly situated land owners were released from time to time and at\nleast up to 2005 and that therefore, discrimination was writ large and there was\ninfraction of Article 14. He relied upon a recent judgment rendered by the Hon ble\nSupreme Court in Hari Ram Versus State of Haryana and others reported in\n(3) SCC 621 where the test of non discrimination has been introduced into\nthe law of land acquisition in respect of State Government s power under Section\nof the Act to release certain lands from acquisition. The land owners who are\nsimilarly situated have right of similar treatment by the State Government in\nrespect of the same acquisition proceedings. The facts in Hari Ram s case\n(supra) are somewhat similar to the facts of the present case. We may quote with\nprofit para No.24 of the judgment which reads as under:-\n As a matter of fact, lands of more than 40 landowners\nout of the same acquisition proceedings have been released by\nthe State Government under Section 48 of the Act. Some of the\nrelease orders have been passed in respect of landowners\nwho had not challenged the acquisition proceedings\nand some of them had challenged the acquisition proceedings\nbefore the High Court and whose cases were not\nrecommended by Joint Inspection Committee for withdrawal\nfrom acquisition and whose writ petitions were dismissed.\nSome of these landowners had only vacant plots of land and\nthere was no construction at all. In most of these cases, the\naward has been passed and, thereafter, the State Government\nhas withdrawn from acquisition. It is not the case of the\nrespondents that withdrawal from acquisition in favour of such\nlandowners has been in violation of any statutory provision or\ncontrary to law. It is also not their case that the release of land\nfrom acquisition in favour of such landowners was wrong\naction on their part or it was done due to some mistake or a\nresult of fraud or corrupt motive. There is nothing to even\nremotely suggest that the persons whose lands have been\nreleased have derived the benefit illegally. As noticed above,\nprior to October 26, 2007, the State Government did not have\nuniform policy concerning withdrawal from acquisition. As\nregards the guidelines provided in the letter dated June 26,\n, this Court has already held that classification on the basis\nof nature of construction cannot be validly made and such\npolicy is not based on intelligible differentia and a rational\nbasis. What appears from the available material is that for\nrelease of the lands under the subject acquisition, no policy has\nbeen adhered to. This leads to an irresistible conclusion that no\nfirm policy with regard to release of land from acquisition\nexisted. It is true that any action or order contrary to law does\nnot confer any right upon any person for similar treatment. It is\nequally true that a landowner whose land has been acquired for\npublic purpose by following the prescribed procedure cannot\nclaim as a matter of right for release of his/her land from\nacquisition but where the State Government exercises its power\nunder Section 48 of the Act for withdrawal from acquisition in\nrespect of a particular land, the landowners who are similarly\nsituated have right of similar treatment by the State\nGovernment. Equality of citizens' rights is one of the\nfundamental pillars on which edifice of rule of law rests. All\nactions of the State have to be fair and for legitimate reasons.\nThe Government has obligation of acting with substantial\nfairness and consistency in considering the representations of\nthe landowners for withdrawal from acquisition whose lands\nhave been acquired under the same acquisition proceedings.\nThe State Government cannot pick and choose some\nlandowners and release their land from acquisition and deny\nthe same benefit to other landowners by creating artificial\ndistinction. Passing different orders in exercise of its power\nunder Section 48 of the Act in respect of persons similarly\nsituated relating to same acquisition proceedings and for same\npublic purpose is definitely violative of Article 14 of the\nConstitution and must be held to be discriminatory. More so, it\nis not even the case of the respondents that release of land\nfrom acquisition.  \nThe above principles have been further elaborated by the Hon ble\nSupreme Court in its landmark judgment in Bondu Ramasawamy and others\nVersus Bangalore Development Authority and others (2010)7 SCC 129. A\nroad map has been laid down for State Government and development authorities\nand the principles to follow in acquiring land under the Act and that the prevailing\nsystem of acquisition of land needs an overhaul. To begin with, there is absence\nof proper or adequate survey and planning before embarking upon acquisition;\nnotifying areas to start with far larger than what is required for acquisition and\nthen making arbitrary deletions and withdrawals from acquisition. The four other\nvital areas delineated in the judgment which have been identified where\ngovernment would have to step in, are not being referred to here as those issues\ndo not arise in the present case.\nMr. Arun Jain has also sought to buttress his argument against the\nacquisition by pointing out that there was no development plan or survey done at\nthe initial stage to rope in substantial constructions of the petitioners made prior\nto notification under Section 4. He relied upon a Division Bench judgment of this\nCourt sounding the clarion call to all the Land Acquisition Collectors and officers\nof the Town and Country Planning Department and other statutory bodies like\nHUDA and HSIIDC to make comprehensive surveys before sending proposal to\nthe Government before issuing notifications under Section 4 of the Act. The\nrelevant part reads as under:-\n The respondent State of Haryana is directed to issue comprehensive\ninstructions to all the Land Acquisition Collectors of the State, Officers of the\nTown and Country Planning Department, various agencies like HUDA, HSIIDC or\nothers to undertake a comprehensive survey before sending the proposal to the\nGovernment for issuance of notifications under Section 4 of the Act. The\nconcerned officers are to ensure that clause 2 of the policy of the State, dated\n.10.2007 for releasing the structures, which have been built up prior to\nissuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act are not included in the\nproposal for acquisition. Such instructions would bring proximity between law, life\nand justice which look to be distant neighbours in the present scenario. It would\navoid unnecessary harassment to the general public who might have constructed\nsmall houses on the land proposed to be acquired. It would also discourage the\nconstruction activity after issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act or the\ntendency of some unscrupulous element to claim that the building was\nconstructed prior to issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act. These\nsteps in turn would reduce the disputes between the general public and the State\npaving the way for developing peaceful society and avoiding litigation. \n.\nOn the issue of discrimination as well the lands and buildings of the\npetitioners deserve to be protected by the manner in which lands of similarly\nsituated landowners was released after acquisition in 1988, after coming into\nexistence of awards of 1990 and from time to time even after 15 years till 2005.\nWe see no useful public purpose will be served in upholding the notifications at\nthis distance of time particularly when the petitioners have had the protection of\ninterim orders of this court staying dispossession. We would confirm those\norders. \n.\nIn view of the above discussion and drawing strength from the\naforesaid judgments, we hold that the impugned notifications under Sections 4\nand 6 deserve to be quashed. We order accordingly.\n.\n This writ petition and the connected writ petitions are allowed and\nthe impugned notifications under Sections 4 and 6 are quashed qua the\npetitioners. \n\n (M.M.KUMAR)\n (RAJIV NARAIN RAINA)\n ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\n\n JUDGE\n\nNovember 9th,2011\n nk\n*\nSerial No.\nCivil Writ Petition No.\nTitle\nof 1990\nRisal Singh and others v.

(Oral):\nSince common questions of law and facts are involved in these\nwrit petitions, the same are disposed of by this common order. \nThe petitioners in all these cases are aggrieved of the\nenhancement of the rental value of the premises which has been made the\nbasis for assessment of the house tax. The petitioners have relied upon\nSection 62 of the Punjab Municipal Act (hereinafter referred to as  the\nAct ) to challenge the assessment. From the bare reading of Section 62 of\nthe Act aforesaid, it is evident that this section applies where assessment is\nto be made for the first time. In the present cases, the properties are already\nassessed for the purposes of payment of House Tax and it is only the order\nof enhancement of the House Tax which has been impugned in these\npetitions.\nLearned counsel for the respondents has, however, taken the\nshelter of Section 67 of the Act. Section 67 of the Act permits\nreassessment or revision of the assessment under the circumstances\nindicated therein which, inter-alia, includes the erroneous assessment on\naccount of mistake, fraud etc. The present cases do not fall in any of the\nconditions. However, Section 65 of the Act deals with revision of the\nassessment list, but this requires a public notice. Admittedly, no public\nCWP No.7331 of 1988 :3:\nnoticed has been issued.\nApart from the above, the respondents have assessed the rental\nvalue without any parameters being adopted, primarily on the grounds that\nadjoining premises is fetching a particular amount as rent. The issue\nrelating to the assessment of the rental value has been considered by the\nApex Court in Dewan Daulat Rai Kapoor etc. etc. Vs. New Delhi\nMunicipal Committee and another etc. etc., AIR 1980, Supreme Court, 54,\nwherein the following observations have been made:-\n 11. .................We are, therefore, of the view that,\neven if the standard rent has not been fixed by the\nController, the landlord cannot reasonably expect\nto receive from a hypothetical tenant anything\nmore than the standard rent determinable under the\nAct and this would be so equally whether the\nbuilding has been let out to a tenant who has lost\nhis right to apply for fixation of the standard rent\nor the building is self-occupied by the owner.\nThe assessing authority would, in either case, have\nto arrive at its own figure of the standard rent by\napplying principles laid down in the Delhi Rent\nControl Act, 1958 for determination of standard\nrent and determine the annual value of the building\non the basis of such figure of standard rent. \nAdmittedly, in all these cases it is alleged by the petitioners that\nCWP No.7331 of 1988 :4:\nthe premises are governed by the Rent Legislation and in view of the\ndictum of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court, the rental value could be\nas is being received by the landlord or where there is no such material, the\nfair rent being payable under Section 3 (1) (b) of the Act, is applicable.\nIn view of the above circumstances, the impugned orders are\nunsustainable in law and are liable to be set aside. I order accordingly.\nConsequently, the maters are remitted back to the Municipal Committees\nconcerned for reassessment of the rental value in accordance with the\njudgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court mentioned above. The concerned\nMunicipal Committees will pass fresh orders after affording opportunity of\nbeing heard to the petitioners.\nWith these observations the writ petitions are disposed of. \nThe parties through their counsel are directed to appear before\nthe concerned Municipal Committees on 01.09.2009 for further\nproceedings. \nA copy of this order be placed on the record of each concerned\nfile. \n.07.2009\n(PERMOD KOHLI)\nBLS\nJUEGE \nNote: Whether to be referred to the Reporter?

      "other similarly placed persons qua the same nature of land and structures. They further contend that the residential houses of the petitioners would in no manner impinge upon or infringe the object and purpose of acquisition, as the land is intended to be acquired for the purpose of residential and commercial development and utilization. They further contend that the writ petitions be allowed and the residential houses along with the land be exempted from acquisition. On the other hand, counsel for the respondents submits that the Government is entitled to acquire the land as well as built up houses. There is no bar with regard to acquisition of residential houses. All provisions as contained under the Land Acquisition Act have been fully complied with. On acquisition of the residential houses and the land of the petitioners, they would be paid adequate compensation in accordance with law and, therefore, they cannot make a grouse in this regard. He has, however, not been able to distinguish the claim of the petitioners for release of their residential houses, in any manner vis-a-vis. the houses of the land owners who have built up their residential houses in khasra Nos.14, 15/1 and 15/2 of rectangle No.50 as also Chhote Lal and others, who have built up their houses on the land comprising khasra No.2 of rectangle No.49, whose land has been exempted from notification under Section 6 of the Act. C.W.P.No.1593 of 1991 -8- We have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. The above-mentioned writ petitions require to be put in four different categories for proper consideration and effective decision of these cases. The first category cases are those wherein the petitioners have asserted that they had constructed their residential houses before the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act, which fact has been admitted by the respondents in their written statement. These writ petitions are C.W.P.Nos.1593, 1906, 1992, 1706, 1887, 2034 and 1929 of . Out of these cases, in some of the writ petitions, it has been asserted by the respondents that some rooms have been built up after the issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act by the petitioners. The second category of cases are those wherein it has been asserted by the petitioners that they had constructed their residential houses before the issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act but no written statement has been filed by the respondents. These are C.W.P.Nos.2036 and 1863 of 1991. The third category of cases would be cases where the factum of construction of the houses before issuance of the notification under Section of the Act has been admitted by the respondents. However, it has been stated that the constructed area stood already released. C.W.P.Nos.1994, and 1705 of 1991 belong to this category. The fourth category are the cases where although it has been asserted by the petitioners in their writ petitions that they had constructed their residential houses before the issuance of the notification under Section C.W.P.No.1593 of 1991 -9- of the Act but in the written statement filed by the State of Haryana, it has been asserted that there was no construction on the land when notification under Section 4 of the Act was issued. C.W.P.Nos.1704 of 1991, C.W.P.No.1905 of 1991 and C.W.P.No.2166 of 1991 are the cases in this category. In none of the cases, replication has been filed by the petitioners and, therefore, the facts as mentioned by the respondents in their written statement have not been controverted by the petitioners. There can be no dispute with regard to the assertion made by the counsel for the respondents that not only the land but also the structures on the land can be acquired under the Act. However, the decision of the State Government in not granting exemption from acquisition or releasing the land of a land owner arbitrarily and resorting to discriminatory approach qua similarly placed and situated land, would violate Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The case in hand is not the one where it is either the assertion of the petitioners or of the State Government that the exemption which has been granted to the similarly placed land owners, whose residential houses have been released from notification under Section 6 on consideration of the objections filed under Section 5-A of the Act, is in violation of the provisions of the Act or contrary to law with a mala fide intention to provide any benefit to those persons; neither is it a case where due to some mistake or result of a fraud or corrupt method, the land of the land owners has been exempted from notification. There is nothing, even remote to suggest that the land owners whose residential houses have been released have derived the benefit illegally. In such circumstances, the land owners, who are similarly C.W.P.No.1593 of 1991 -10- situated, have a right to receive similar treatment by the State Government. They cannot be discriminated against. All actions of the State have to be fair and for legitimate reasons. The State Government cannot pick and choose some land owners and exempt their land from acquisition and deny the same benefit to other similarly situated land owners. In the present case, the respondent-State has failed to give any explanation, what to say of reasonable one, with regard to the allegations of discrimination qua the residential houses of similarly placed land-owners. The specific pleadings in the writ petitions, mentioning the names of land owners, khasra and rectangle numbers whose residential houses in the same vicinity and area have been exempted/released from acquisition have not been denied by the respondents. Nor any reasons have been assigned for not releasing/exempting the land of the petitioners where their residential houses exist. This apparently leads to the conclusion that the respondent- State had not acted fairly and has discriminated with regard to the petitioners. It is also not the case of the respondents that the release of residential houses of the petitioners would frustrate the purpose of acquisition. It would not be out of way to mention here that the purpose of acquisition of the land is for residential and commercial development and utilization and what is being sought to be exempted by the petitioners are their only residential houses. A plea has been raised by the respondents that the rooms which have been constructed by the petitioners in most of the cases are of C-class construction whereas in some of the cases the same is of B-Class as well. However, that would not be relevant as the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sube Singh and others vs. State of Haryana and others, (2001) 7 SCC 545 has held that the class of C.W.P.No.1593 of 1991 -11- construction on the land of land-owners to be taken into consideration for release or exemption from acquisition is not based on intelligible differentia and a rationale basis germane to the purpose. Accordingly, the class of construction does not make a difference for considering exemption from acquisition. As has been held above, the respondent-State has discriminated qua the petitioners in cases where the residential houses were in existence prior to the issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act. Accordingly, cases falling in category No.1 i.e. C.W.P.Nos.1593, 1906, , 1706, 1887, 2034 and 1929 of 1991 are allowed. Direction is issued to the respondents in these cases to release the land of the petitioners from acquisition to the extent occupied by the structures which were used for residential purpose only on the date of issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act along with equal open area for the beneficial enjoyment of the petitioners from their land. It is clarified here that land under the constructed area not being used for residential purpose strictly i.e. for purposes subservient to agriculture like tube-well, cattle shed, fodder store/shed, dairy farming, poultry farming etc. shall not be treated as released as it would violate and not fit in the purpose of acquisition. As regards category No.2 i.e. C.W.P.Nos.2036 and 1863 of , since no reply has been filed by the respondents, a direction is issued to the respondents to verify the claim of the petitioners and if it is found as per the records that there were constructed residential houses before the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act, directions as issued in category No.1 cases shall apply. C.W.P.No.1593 of 1991 -12- As regards category No.3 i.e.C.W.P.Nos.1994, 1886 and 1705 of 1991, these writ petitions deserve to be dismissed on the ground that the constructed area of the residential houses stand already released and, therefore, no directions with regard to the land to the extent occupied by the structures is required to be issued. However, in case equal open area abutting the structure has not been released for the beneficial enjoyment of the petitioners, the same shall be released by the respondents from the land of the petitioners. However, directions issued in the above categories of cases shall not come in the way of the Authorities in removing the structures, if the same is required for roads, hospitals or other civic amenities or common sites or public utility areas as per the lay-out plan. The respondents shall try as far as possible to retain the structures unless it becomes difficult for them to have a planned development without removing them. It would also be open to the Authorities to make adjustments or re-adjustments of plots for the purpose of planned development and in case it becomes necessary to give an additional area to the petitioners, the petitioners shall be bound to take the additional area and also be bound to pay cost for such area, as is chargeable to other allottees. The petitioners shall also be bound to pay the development charges as is charged from the other allottees. The afore-stated directions be complied with by the respondents within a period of four months from today. Till then, interim order in their favour shall continue to operate. As regards category No.4 i.e.C.W.P.Nos.1704, 1905 and of 1991, these are the cases where specific stand of the C.W.P.No.1593 of 1991 -13- respondents is that there was no construction on the land in question when notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was issued No replication having been filed by the petitioners, the averment made by the respondents is taken to be correct and, therefore, the petitioners cannot claim discrimination qua the constructed residential houses of others. Accordingly, their writ petitions deserve to be dismissed. Ordered accordingly. Photostat copy of this order be placed in the other connected cases.

Counsel for the parties have\nalso stated in the same terms. Accordingly, the cases are taken up for\nhearing together.\nBriefly, the facts are that the Government of Haryana, Urban\nEstate Department, issued a notification dated 2.8.1989 under Section 4 of\nthe Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act')\nproposing to acquire 194.97 acres of land situated in the revenue estate of\nvillage Mewla Maharajpur, Hadbast No.4, Tehsil Ballabgarh, District\nC.W.P.No.1593 of 1991\n-5-\nFaridabad, for development and utilization of the notified land as residential\nand commercial purposes in Sector 45 of Faridabad under the Haryana\nUrban Development Authority Act, 1977. Almost all the petitioners in the\nwrit petitions submitted their objections under Section 5-A of the Act. The\nappropriate Government, on consideration of the same, did not accept all the\nobjections leading to the issuance of a notification under Section 6 of the\nAct on 1.8.1990 wherein a declaration was issued for acquisition of 184.66\nacres of land meaning thereby that 10.31 acres of land was exempted from\nacquisition. Thereafter, notice under Section 9 of the Act was served on the\npetitioners on 15.1.1991 leading to the filing of the above-mentioned writ\npetitions praying therein for release of the constructed houses of the\npetitioners as had been released qua others for example residential houses\nconstructed in Khasra No.14, 15/1 and 15/2 of rectangle No.50 as also of\nChhote Lal and others, who have built their houses on the land comprising\nkhasra No.22/2 of rectangle No.49. Houses constructed by Jamal and\nothers on khasra No.18 of rectangle No.42 have also been exempted from\nacquisition. The petitioners have contended that they are similarly situated\nand have their built up houses in the same vicinity, but they have been\ndiscriminated against, thereby leading to violation of Article 14 of the\nConstitution of India. It has been pleaded that their objections have been\nwrongly rejected whereas the objections of similarly placed persons have\nbeen accepted and their residential houses have been released while the\nhouses of the petitioners which are their only residential houses have been\nacquired. Accordingly, the petitioners have prayed for quashing of\nnotifications dated 2.8.1989 and 1.8.1990 issued under Sections 4 and 6 of\nthe Act respectively, as well as notice dated 15.1.1991 issued under Section\nC.W.P.No.1593 of 1991\n-6-\nof the Act.\nState of Haryana has contested the claim of the petitioners;\nhowever, in reply to the assertions made by the petitioners with regard to\nthe release of residential houses of similarly placed persons, no specific\ndenial has been made of the assertions, except for that of Jamal and\nothers as it has been stated that they had filed a writ petition in this\nCourt but it has not been averred about any stay granted by this Court or\nthe stage of the case.\nAs regards the construction in some of the cases, the factum of\nthere being C- class construction before issuance of the notification under\nSection 4 of the Act, has been admitted, while in some cases it has been\npleaded that the acquired land which was having construction on it stands\nreleased. In some other cases, it has been stated that there was no\nconstruction on the land at the time of issuance of notification under\nSection 4 of the Act. In two of the writ petitions, no reply has been filed\nwherein the petitioners have asserted that they have constructed their houses\nbefore the issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act. It would not\nbe out of way to mention here that the respondents have simply pleaded in\nthe reply that the land of the petitioners has been acquired in accordance\nwith the Act but it has not been pleaded that by exempting the land of the\npetitioners or releasing the same from acquisition, the purpose of the Land\nAcquisition Act would stand frustrated.\nCounsel for the petitioners submits that the petitioners have\nwith great difficulty constructed their residential houses in the land in\nquestion and have no other residential houses. If the petitioners are\nuprooted from the land at this stage, especially when residential houses of\nC.W.P.No.1593 of 1991\n-7-\nsimilarly placed persons in the same vicinity stand exempted from\nacquisition while issuing notification under Section 6 of the Act, they\nwould be rendered homeless. The petitioners also deserve the same\ntreatment and are entitled to the said benefit. The respondents cannot be\nallowed to discriminate the petitioners without assigning any distinction\nbetween the claim of the petitioners and other similarly placed persons\nqua the same nature of land and structures. They further contend that the\nresidential houses of the petitioners would in no manner impinge upon\nor infringe the object and purpose of acquisition, as the land is intended\nto be acquired for the purpose of residential and commercial development\nand utilization. They further contend that the writ petitions be allowed\nand the residential houses along with the land be exempted from\nacquisition.\nOn the other hand, counsel for the respondents submits that the\nGovernment is entitled to acquire the land as well as built up houses. There\nis no bar with regard to acquisition of residential houses. All provisions as\ncontained under the Land Acquisition Act have been fully complied with.\nOn acquisition of the residential houses and the land of the petitioners, they\nwould be paid adequate compensation in accordance with law and,\ntherefore, they cannot make a grouse in this regard. He has, however, not\nbeen able to distinguish the claim of the petitioners for release of their\nresidential houses, in any manner vis-a-vis. the houses of the land owners\nwho have built up their residential houses in khasra Nos.14, 15/1 and 15/2\nof rectangle No.50 as also Chhote Lal and others, who have built up their\nhouses on the land comprising khasra No.2 of rectangle No.49, whose land\nhas been exempted from notification under Section 6 of the Act.\nC.W.P.No.1593 of 1991\n-8-\nWe have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through\nthe records of the case.\nThe above-mentioned writ petitions require to be put in four\ndifferent categories for proper consideration and effective decision of these\ncases. \nThe first category cases are those wherein the petitioners have\nasserted that they had constructed their residential houses before the\nissuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act, which fact has been\nadmitted by the respondents in their written statement. These writ\npetitions are C.W.P.Nos.1593, 1906, 1992, 1706, 1887, 2034 and 1929 of\n. Out of these cases, in some of the writ petitions, it has been asserted\nby the respondents that some rooms have been built up after the issuance\nof the notification under Section 4 of the Act by the petitioners. \nThe second category of cases are those wherein it has been\nasserted by the petitioners that they had constructed their residential houses\nbefore the issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act but no\nwritten statement has been filed by the respondents. These are\nC.W.P.Nos.2036 and 1863 of 1991.\nThe third category of cases would be cases where the factum of\nconstruction of the houses before issuance of the notification under Section\nof the Act has been admitted by the respondents. However, it has been\nstated that the constructed area stood already released. C.W.P.Nos.1994,\nand 1705 of 1991 belong to this category.\nThe fourth category are the cases where although it has been\nasserted by the petitioners in their writ petitions that they had constructed\ntheir residential houses before the issuance of the notification under Section\nC.W.P.No.1593 of 1991\n-9-\nof the Act but in the written statement filed by the State of Haryana, it has\nbeen asserted that there was no construction on the land when notification\nunder Section 4 of the Act was issued. C.W.P.Nos.1704 of 1991,\nC.W.P.No.1905 of 1991 and C.W.P.No.2166 of 1991 are the cases in this\ncategory. \nIn none of the cases, replication has been filed by the\npetitioners and, therefore, the facts as mentioned by the respondents in their\nwritten statement have not been controverted by the petitioners. \nThere can be no dispute with regard to the assertion made by\nthe counsel for the respondents that not only the land but also the\nstructures on the land can be acquired under the Act. However, the decision\nof the State Government in not granting exemption from acquisition or\nreleasing the land of a land owner arbitrarily and resorting to\ndiscriminatory approach qua similarly placed and situated land, would\nviolate Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The case in hand is not the\none where it is either the assertion of the petitioners or of the State\nGovernment that the exemption which has been granted to the similarly\nplaced land owners, whose residential houses have been released from\nnotification under Section 6 on consideration of the objections filed under\nSection 5-A of the Act, is in violation of the provisions of the Act or\ncontrary to law with a mala fide intention to provide any benefit to those\npersons; neither is it a case where due to some mistake or result of a fraud\nor corrupt method, the land of the land owners has been exempted from\nnotification. There is nothing, even remote to suggest that the land owners\nwhose residential houses have been released have derived the benefit\nillegally. In such circumstances, the land owners, who are similarly\nC.W.P.No.1593 of 1991\n-10-\nsituated, have a right to receive similar treatment by the State Government.\nThey cannot be discriminated against. All actions of the State have to be\nfair and for legitimate reasons. The State Government cannot pick and\nchoose some land owners and exempt their land from acquisition and deny\nthe same benefit to other similarly situated land owners. In the present case,\nthe respondent-State has failed to give any explanation, what to say of\nreasonable one, with regard to the allegations of discrimination qua the\nresidential houses of similarly placed land-owners. The specific pleadings\nin the writ petitions, mentioning the names of land owners, khasra and\nrectangle numbers whose residential houses in the same vicinity and area\nhave been exempted/released from acquisition have not been denied by the\nrespondents. Nor any reasons have been assigned for not\nreleasing/exempting the land of the petitioners where their residential\nhouses exist. This apparently leads to the conclusion that the respondent-\nState had not acted fairly and has discriminated with regard to the\npetitioners. It is also not the case of the respondents that the release of\nresidential houses of the petitioners would frustrate the purpose of\nacquisition. It would not be out of way to mention here that the purpose of\nacquisition of the land is for residential and commercial development and\nutilization and what is being sought to be exempted by the petitioners are\ntheir only residential houses. A plea has been raised by the respondents\nthat the rooms which have been constructed by the petitioners in most of the\ncases are of C-class construction whereas in some of the cases the same\nis of B-Class as well. However, that would not be relevant as the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sube Singh and others vs. \n\n State of\n\nHaryana and others, (2001) 7 SCC 545 has held that the class of\nC.W.P.No.1593 of 1991\n-11-\nconstruction on the land of land-owners to be taken into consideration for\nrelease or exemption from acquisition is not based on intelligible\ndifferentia and a rationale basis germane to the purpose. Accordingly, the\nclass of construction does not make a difference for considering\nexemption from acquisition.\nAs has been held above, the respondent-State has discriminated\nqua the petitioners in cases where the residential houses were in existence\nprior to the issuance of the notification under Section 4 of the Act.\nAccordingly, cases falling in category No.1 i.e. C.W.P.Nos.1593, 1906,\n, 1706, 1887, 2034 and 1929 of 1991 are allowed.

It is clarified here that land\nunder the constructed area not being used for residential purpose strictly\ni.e. for purposes subservient to agriculture like tube-well, cattle shed,\nfodder store/shed, dairy farming, poultry farming etc. shall not be\ntreated as released as it would violate and not fit in the purpose of\nacquisition.\nAs regards category No.2 i.e. C.W.P.Nos.2036 and 1863 of\n, since no reply has been filed by the respondents, a direction is issued\nto the respondents to verify the claim of the petitioners and if it is found as\nper the records that there were constructed residential houses before the\nissuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act, directions as issued in\ncategory No.1 cases shall apply.\nC.W.P.No.1593 of 1991\n-12-\nAs regards category No.3 i.e.C.W.P.Nos.1994, 1886 and 1705\nof 1991, these writ petitions deserve to be dismissed on the ground that the\nconstructed area of the residential houses stand already released and,\ntherefore, no directions with regard to the land to the extent occupied by the\nstructures is required to be issued. However, in case equal open area\nabutting the structure has not been released for the beneficial enjoyment of\nthe petitioners, the same shall be released by the respondents from the land\nof the petitioners.\nHowever, directions issued in the above categories of cases\nshall not come in the way of the Authorities in removing the structures, if\nthe same is required for roads, hospitals or other civic amenities or\ncommon sites or public utility areas as per the lay-out plan. The\nrespondents shall try as far as possible to retain the structures unless it\nbecomes difficult for them to have a planned development without\nremoving them. It would also be open to the Authorities to make\nadjustments or re-adjustments of plots for the purpose of planned\ndevelopment and in case it becomes necessary to give an additional area to\nthe petitioners, the petitioners shall be bound to take the additional area\nand also be bound to pay cost for such area, as is chargeable to other\nallottees. The petitioners shall also be bound to pay the development\ncharges as is charged from the other allottees. \nThe afore-stated directions be complied with by the\nrespondents within a period of four months from today. Till then, interim\norder in their favour shall continue to operate.\nAs regards category No.4 i.e.C.W.P.Nos.1704, 1905 and\nof 1991, these are the cases where specific stand of the\nC.W.P.No.1593 of 1991\n-13-\nrespondents is that there was no construction on the land in question when\nnotification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act was issued No\nreplication having been filed by the petitioners, the averment made by the\nrespondents is taken to be correct and, therefore, the petitioners cannot\nclaim discrimination qua the constructed residential houses of others.\nAccordingly, their writ petitions deserve to be dismissed.

(Oral)\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997 has been preferred by\nRajinder Singh who was nominated as accused in case FIR No. 27\ndated 6.6.1994 registered at Police Station Amloh under Sections 307\nread with Section 34 IPC.\nAppellant was tried along with his wife Balbir Kaur and learned\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Fatehgarh Sahib, acquitted his wife and\nheld him guilty under Section 307 IPC and sentenced him to undergo\nfive years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.2,000/-. In default of\npayment of fine, he was further ordered to undergo four months rigorous\nimprisonment.\n\nLearned trial Court has held that the appellant has caused\ninjuries to Baljit Singh with a gatra kirpan on the right side of chest of\nthe victim and the chest injury was declared dangerous to life. Baljit\nCriminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997 \nSingh injured remained admitted in C.M.C. Ludhiana. On 4.6.1994, he\nwas medicolegally examined by Dr.A.Joseph and the following injuries\nwere found on his person:-\n 1.\ncm long incised wound on his right side\nchest anteriorly in 6th intercostal space\nabout 10 cm from midline communicating\nwith plaural cavity, bleeding was present;\n.\ncm long incised wound left side chest\nanterior-lateral aspect about 13 cm from\nmidline in 5th of intercostal space minimum\nbleeding was present;\n.\n.5 cm long incised wound left side chest\nanteriorly about 10 cm from midline in 7th\nintercostal space minimum bleeding was\npresent;\n.\ncm long incised wound left side of chest\nlaterally about 21 cm from midline\nsubcutaneous tissue was deep, minimal\nbleeding was present; AND\n.\ncm long incised wound left elbow\nposteriorly subcutaneous tissue deep,\nminimal bleeding was present .\nBaljit Singh injured, appeared as PW.3. He has reiterated the\nversion given by him in the FIR. Briefly stated, Baljit Singh PW.3 has\nstated that appellant Rajinder Singh along with his wife Balbir Kaur\ncame in the hutment in the fields. They raised objection as the water\nCriminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997 \nseepage used to go to the fields of accused. It is further stated that\nBalbir Kaur caught hold of him from his leg and Rajinder Singh caught\nhold him from his arms and thereafter Rajinder Singh took out his gatra\nkirpan and gave three blows on the left flank, which caused injuries on\nthe ribs of Baljit Singh, complainant. It was stated that the motive for the\noccurrence was a land dispute regarding partition of land. Baljit Singh\nwas thoroughly cross-examined. The defence failed to cause any dent in\nhis testimony. \nBaljit Singh, PW.3, was corroborated by the testimony of\nMalkiat Singh, PW.4. \n\nIt has been stated before me that no reliance should be placed\nby this Court on the testimony of Baljit Singh, PW.3 and Malkiat Singh,\nPW.4 as they are interested witnesses and no independent witness has\nbeen examined. It has been further contended that there are material\ndiscrepancies, contradictions and improvements in the testimony of the\nwitnesses, therefore, they suffer from blemish. It has been further stated\nthat there is a delay of 30 hours in lodging of FIR and, therefore, the\nprosecution case should be disbelieved.\nHaving heard Mr. R.K.Battas, I am of the considered opinion\nthat these arguments in itself are not sufficient to return acquittal of the\nappellant. As far as the delay is concerned, benefit has already been\ngiven to the wife of appellant. Baljit Singh is an injured witness. His\npresence at the spot is stamped. He will be the last person to substitute\nor falsely implicate any other person as accused. Accused and\nwitnesses belong to the same village. Furthermore, testimony of the\nwitnesses is fully corroborated by the medical evidence and the\nCriminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997 \ninvestigating agency has examined the spot. Therefore, on this ground,\nI am afraid, sole accused cannot be acquitted when the injured had\ntaken a definite stand against him in the witness box. \n\nIn the alternate, Mr. Battas has contended that in the present\ncase occurrence pertains to year 1994 and a period of 14 years is going\nto lapse and protracted trial in itself should be construed as mitigating\ncircumstance. It is further contended that the parties are residents of\nsame village and sending the appellant behind the bars at this stage\nmay not disrupt peace, amity and cordial relations prevailing between\nthe parties. At the same time, this Court is conscious of the fact that the\ninjuries given were very serious. Victim remained in C.M.C. Ludhiana\nand the treatment given to him as revealed by the doctor, in his\nstatement, does not entitle the appellant to reduction of sentence to\nalready undergone especially when the appellant has only undergone\ntwo months and ten days.\nTaking totality of circumstances into view, ends of justice will\nbe fully met in case sentence of appellant is reduced from five years to\ntwo and a half years and fine is increased to Rs.20,000/- and the fine be\ndeposited within three months. Fine so deposited, be disbursed to the\ninjured. In case the fine is not deposited then the appellant shall\nundergo six months in default.\n\nWith these observations, the present appeal is disposed off.\n\n (Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\n Judge\nMarch 18, 2008\n\n DK"

Bhandari, Advocate \nfor the petitioner.\nMr. Satish Bhanot, Senior Deputy Advocate \nGeneral, Punjab, for the respondent.\nKanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia, J. (Oral)\n\nThe present petitioner has raised two fold submissions in the\npresent writ petition. It was stated by the petitioner that he joined as\nOctroi Superintendent in the Municipal committee, Malerkotla, in August\n. The petitioner submitted that he has working in Class-I\nMunicipalities. At the time when Punjab Municipal Service (Recruitment\nand Conditions of Service) Rules, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as  the\nRules ) were enforced, there were 12 posts of Executive Officers of\nClass-I. Later on 14 more posts were created. Thus, there were 26 posts\nof Executive Officers of Class-I. \nThe petitioner has raised grievance against the advertisement\ndated 30.9.1987 issued by the State of Punjab for filling up nine posts of\nCivil Writ Petition No. 4710 of 1989 \nExecutive Officers of Class-I for the State of Punjab through direct\nrecruitment. Petitioner stated that since he acquired experience, the\naction of respondent-Punjab State is bad in issuing interview letters to\nthe persons for appointment as Executive Officers in Municipal\nCommittees Grade-I by way of direct recruitment. \n\nAn affidavit was submitted by the Under Secretary to the\nGovernment of Punjab in which it was stated that as per the 1975 Rules,\nnine posts of Executive Officers of Class-I in the State are to be filled up\nby way of direct recruitment in accordance with the Rules. It is stated\nthat six persons were absorbed as Executive Officers in Class-I\nMunicipal Committees in terms of Rule 5(1) of the above said Rules and\nas per Rules, 50% vacancies are to be filled up by way of direct\nrecruitment and 50% vacancies are to be filled up by promotion on\nseniority-cum-merit basis. \nMr. Bhanot has very categorically stated that the petitioner has\nretired.\nSecond grievance made in the present writ petition is that\npetitioner had discharged his duties as Executive Officer of Class-I in\nClass-I Municipal Committees in his own pay scale, therefore, he is\nentitled to be paid salary as per the scale which were admissible to the\nExecutive Officer Class-I. Petitioner has stated that since he had\ndischarged his duties as Executive Officers Class-I the maxim of  Equal\nPay for Equal Work  has to operate in his favour and State is bound to\npay the salary to him as the Executive Officer Grade-I.\nIn reply filed, it has been submitted that till the direct recruits\nwere to be appointed on the administrative ground, petitioner as\nCivil Writ Petition No. 4710 of 1989 \nExecutive Officers Class-II was asked to discharge duties as Executive\nOfficer Grade-I. It has been stated that petitioner was neither appointed\nas Executive Officers Class-I by way of direct recruitment nor by way of\npromotion. If due to the exigencies of situation, an employee, till the new\nincumbent arrived, working in a lower grade is asked to discharge duties\non a similar post having a higher grade as a stop gap arrangement, he\ncannot claim that he should be paid salary according to the higher grade.\nMr. Bhanot states that later all the petitioner was promoted as\nExecutive Officer Class-I.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon Smt. P.\nGrover v. State of Haryana 1983(2) Services Law Reporter 734, in\nwhich it was held that where a person is promoted and is paid lower\nscale that cannot be sustained. This judgment is of no help to the\npetitioner to the present writ petition as in the present case there was no\npromotional order of the petitioner. He was to only discharge duties till\nthe direct incumbents were appointed. Petitioner was Executive Officer\nof Municipal Committee Grade-II, simply because he was discharging the\nsame duties in Municipal Committee Grade-I, it will not be held that he\nwas discharging the duties of a post which carried some onerous\nresponsibility. \nSimilarly, the other two judgments rendered in Anand Parkash\nv. State of Punjab 2005(3) Recent Services Judgments 749 and\njudgment rendered by learned Single Bench of this Court in Satish\nKumar and Others v. State of Haryana (Civil Writ Petition No. 8615\nof 1991 decided on 20.10.1993) are of no help to the petitioner as in\nSatish Kumar's cas (supra), petitioner was not considered for\nCivil Writ Petition No. 4710 of 1989 \npromotion. In the present case, post was meant for direct recruits. Since\nthe petitioner was not discharging duties of higher responsibility,\ntherefore, he is not entitled to the relief sought.\n\nMr. Bhanot states that at the relevant time, services rendered\nin Municipal Committee Grade-I was provincial service and the petitioner\nwas to be selected to become member of Municipal Committee Grade-I.\nHe cannot claim that he should be paid the salary which is due to the\nExecutive Officer discharging the duties of Municipal Grade-I.\n\nIt has been consistently considered and held by this Court that\nonly a regular selection by way of advertisement or from requisition made\nfrom the Employment Exchange shall vest right in the incumbent. A\nperson like petitioner discharging duties will not be entitled to the benefit\nof scale prevailing for that post.\n\nHence, there is no merit in the present petition, same is\ndismissed.\n(Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\n Judge\nDecember 17, 2008\n\n DK"

Whether Reporters of Local Newspapers may be allowed to see the\n judgment ?\n. To be referred to the Reporters or not ?\n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest ?\n***\nAJAY TEWARI, J (Oral)\nBy this writ petition, the petitioner claims that he should be\ngranted pay for two years Special Engineering Degree Course which he\ncleared as an inservice candidate. \nIt is not disputed that when the petitioner applied for study\nleave, there was no policy governing the conditions thereof. Leave was\ngranted to the petitioner to pursue the course on the execution of an\naffidavit from him wherein he mentioned as follows :-\nC.W.P\n\n No. 2106 of 1990\n\n::2:: \n  1.\nThat all the expenses would have to bear by me.\n.\nThat I will serve the Board for a period of 2 years\nafter acquiring higher qualification.\n.\nThat I will not claim any benefit except those\ngiven by the Board from time to time as a result of higher\nqualification.\n.\nThat for study period I will apply leave which will\nbe at liberty of the Board for consideration on merit. \nSubsequently, the respondents formulated a policy to govern\nthe conditions for grant of paid study leave. Condition No.1 thereof was to\nthe following effect :-\n  i)\nThe candidate seeking admission in the Degree\nCourse should have atleast 5 years Regular Service in the\nBoard. \nSince on the date of applying, the petitioner did not qualify the\nabove mentioned condition, his prayer was declined. At that stage, the\npetitioner filed CWP No.12431 of 1989, which was disposed of with a\ndirection to the respondents to pass a speaking order. Even in the speaking\norder dated 12.1.1990, it has been mentioned that since the petitioner does\nnot fulfill the essential qualification of having 5 years regular service, the\nbenefit of paid leave cannot be granted to him. The case of another person\nwhich was relied upon by the petitioner was distinguished on the ground\nthat such person had five years service to his credit. \nCounsel for the petitioner has laid stress particularly on para 3\nof the policy which is to the following effect :-\n  3.\nThe above decision of the Board would also be\napplicable to the officials, who have joined a regular\ncourse. \nAs per the counsel for the petitioner, under para 3 the petitioner\nwould be covered, since he had already joined the regular course. \nHowever, counsel for the respondents states that the said para 3\nC.W.P\n\n No. 2106 of 1990\n\n::3:: \nwould be applicable to those officials who may have joined prior to the\npolicy and fulfilled the condition and that it would not enure to the benefit\nof the petitioner. \nIn my opinion, the argument of counsel for the respondents has\nto be accepted. It cannot be lost sight of that on the date the petitioner\napplied, there was no provision for grant of paid study leave. The petitioner\nwas granted study leave on the basis of the affidavit sworn by him. In the\ncircumstances, he cannot be held to be entitled to the benefit of the policy. \nCounsel for the petitioner has further argued that since the\npredominant factor of the policy is that study leave benefits not only the\nemployee but the employer also, such a pedantic interpretation should not\nbe given. He has laid stress particularly on the fact that since the passing of\nthe course, the petitioner has been in service of the respondents and, thus,\nthe benefit of his acquiring higher professional qualification has definitely\nenriched his job profile. He further states that even in the policy, the\nsafeguard incorporated by the respondents is that the person will undertake\nto serve the respondents for a period of five years after finishing the Course\n(so that due benefit of his higher qualification can be derived by the\nrespondents). As per the learned counsel, the petitioner has been in service\nof the Board throughout and, thus, he has fulfilled the condition of not only\nfive years service but more than two decades of service. \nIn my opinion, this argument of counsel for the petitioner\nwould not be the determinative, as the Court is mindful of the fact that the\ncondition to which the petitioner subjected himself was only two years\nservice. As per his affidavit, he could have left the service after two years\nC.W.P\n\n No. 2106 of 1990\n\n::4:: \nand the respondents could have raised no grievance against it. \nCounsel for the petitioner has further argued that para 3, quoted\nabove, makes it clear that the condition of five years service is only\nprospective in nature and cannot be retrospectively applied to those persons\nwho have already availed the benefit. He has also argued that once the\nname of the petitioner was sponsored he could not be denied the benefit. \nAs regards the first argument, it cannot be accepted for the\nsimple reason that prior to the policy there was no provision relating to the\ngrant of paid study leave. Thus, there is no question of adjustment or any\nretrospectivity to this stipulation. As regards the second argument, the same\ncan be disposed of by observing that right to unpaid study leave is totally\ndifferent to the right of paid study leave and merely because the petitioner\nhad been sponsored for study leave, which at that time could not be paid\nstudy leave (for want of any policy in this regard), it did not entitle him to\nclaim right that his sponsorship was under the new policy. \nConsequently, finding no merit in this writ petition, the same is\ndismissed with no order as to costs. \n\n ( AJAY TEWARI )\nNovember 29, 2010. \n JUDGE\n`kk'"

JUSTICE AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH\n* * *\nPresent :\nMr. Bikram Chaudhary, Advocate\nfor the petitioner.\nMr. D.S.Nalwa, Addl. A.G. Haryana,\nfor the respondents.\n* * *\nAUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. (ORAL)\nPrayer in the present writ petition is for issuance of a writ in the\nnature of mandamus directing the respondents-State of Haryana to give\nthe benefit of revision of pay scale to the petitioner as given to the HCMS\n(Doctors) and Engineers vide notification dated 02.06.1989\n(Annexure P-1).\nIt is the claim of the petitioner that he was appointed on the\npost of Transport Officer in the Department of Health, Government of\nHaryana. The qualification prescribed for appointment to the post of \nCWP No. 17346 of 1991 \nTransport Officer was Matric with certificate or diploma in Mechanical or\nAutomobile Engineering with 5 years (3 years for diploma holders)\ntechnical and administrative experience in the State Transport or in\nAutomobile Workshop with adequate knowledge of Hindi or Punjabi. On\nthe basis of these qualifications, it has been asserted by the petitioner that\nhe belongs to the category of Engineers. It has further been pleaded that\nthe petitioner is entitled to the equation of the post of Transport Officer with\nthat of Engineer as initially, when the petitioner was appointed, the pay\nscale of the post, which the petitioner was holding, was higher than that of\nthe Engineers but subsequently with the revision of pay scale w.e.f.\n.04.1979, the pay scale of the post held by the petitioner has been kept\nlower than those of the degree holder Engineers. From 01.01.1986, the\npetitioner was granted the pay scale of Rs. 2000-3500 whereas the\nEngineers also were granted the same scale but subsequently w.e.f.\n.05.1989, after a period of 5 years of regular service, the pay scale has\nbeen fixed at Rs. 3000-4500 and after 12 years, it would be Rs. 4100-\n. On the basis of these, the petitioner is claiming that he is entitled to\nthe scale of Rs. 3000-4500 after 5 years of regular service and Rs. 4100-\nafter 12 years of regular service. This claim of the petitioner is\nprimarily based on the analogy that he belongs to the category of\nEngineers and, therefore, would be entitled to the same benefit.\nOn the other hand, the respondents have taken a specific\nstand that the post of Transport Officer was never equated with that of an\nEngineer. The petitioner is holding a diploma in Engineering whereas he is\nclaiming the benefit of equation of pay with that of degree holder\nEngineers. The petitioner was placed in the pay scale of Rs. 2000-3500\nw.e.f. 01.01.1986 but as a measure personal to him and taking a \nCWP No. 17346 of 1991 \nlenient view, the petitioner has been granted the scale of Rs. 2200-4000/-\nw.e.f. 01.10.1991. It has further been pleaded that the nature of duties,\nresponsibilities, qualifications of the post of the petitioner and that of the\nEngineers, is totally different nor has there ever been an equation of these\nposts, thus, dis-entitling the petitioner to the claim, which has been made\nby him in the writ petition. It has further been stated that the pay scale of\nthe petitioner became same as that of the Engineers because of the\nbunching of various pay scales when the revision of the pay scales took\nplace.\nCounsel for the petitioner submits that as the petitioner holds\nthe minimum qualification, which requires a diploma in Automobile\nEngineering, therefore, for all intents and purposes, he should be treated\nas an Engineer and thus, entitled to the pay scale, which has been granted\nto the Engineers vide notification dated 02.06.1989.\nOn the other hand, counsel for the respondents submits that\nthe notification dated 02.06.1989 (Annexure P-1), reliance whereof has\nbeen made by the petitioner, is specifically applicable only to the Doctors\nand Engineers. Merely because the petitioner holds the diploma in\nAutomobile Engineering, does not entitle him the benefit of the post of an\nEngineer, especially when there is no equation of the said post and further\nthat the qualifications, responsibilities and duties are different. He further\ncontends that it is not a function of the Court to equate the post or grant\nequation of pay scales, which should be left to the Expert Bodies and the\nExecutives. In support of this contention, he relies upon a judgment of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. vs. J.P.Chaurasia,\n(1) SCC 121.\nI have heard the counsel for the parties and have gone\nthrough the records of the case.\nCWP No. 17346 of 1991 \nIt is not in dispute that the qualifications, duties, responsibilities\nand the work performed by the petitioner and the Engineers is different.\nThere has never been an equation of the two posts nor has the post of\nTransport Officer ever been declared as a post of an Engineer. That being\nso, the notification dated 02.06.1989 would not be applicable to the\npetitioner. Further, the pay scale and the post also can be equated by an\nExpert Body which the Court should refrain from performing the role unless\nthere is overwhelming evidence on record in this regard. Generally, it\nshould be left open to the Executives to perform the said responsibility.\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. vs. J.P.Chaurasia\n(supra) has also held on similar lines.\nIn view of the above, finding no merit in the present writ\npetition, the same stands dismissed.\nAugust 18, 2010\n\n(AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH )\npj\n\n JUDGE"

Bhandari, Advocate \nfor the petitioner.\nMr. Satish Bhanot, Senior Deputy Advocate \nGeneral, Punjab, for respondent No.1.\nNone for respondents No.2 and 3.\nKanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia, J. (Oral)\n\nThe present petitioner has raised two fold submissions in the\npresent writ petition. It was stated by the petitioner that he joined as\nSecretary in the Municipal committee, Chheharta, District Amritsar in\nAugust 1957. The petitioner submitted that he has working in Class-I\nMunicipalities. At the time when Punjab Municipal Service (Recruitment\nand Conditions of Service) Rules, 1975 (hereinafter referred to as  the\nRules ) were enforced, there were 12 posts of Executive Officers of\nClass-I. Later on 14 more posts were created. Thus, there were 26 posts\nof Executive Officers of Class-I. \nThe petitioner has raised grievance against the advertisement\nCivil Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1989 \ndated 30.9.1987 issued by the State of Punjab for filling up nine posts of\nExecutive Officers of Class-I for the State of Punjab through direct\nrecruitment. Petitioner stated that since he acquired experience, the\naction of respondent-Punjab State is bad in issuing interview letters to\nthe persons for appointment as Executive Officers in Municipal\nCommittees Grade-I by way of direct recruitment. \n\nAn affidavit was submitted by the Under Secretary to the\nGovernment of Punjab in which it was stated that as per the 1975 Rules,\nnine posts of Executive Officers of Class-I in the State are to be filled up\nby way of direct recruitment in accordance with the Rules. It is stated\nthat six persons were absorbed as Executive Officers in Class-I\nMunicipal Committees in terms of Rule 5(1) of the above said Rules and\nas per Rules, 50% vacancies are to be filled up by way of direct\nrecruitment and 50% vacancies are to be filled up by promotion on\nseniority-cum-merit basis. \nMr. Bhanot has very categorically stated that the petitioner has\nretired.\nSecond grievance made in the present writ petition is that\npetitioner had discharged his duties as Executive Officer of Class-I in\nClass-I Municipal Committees in his own pay scale, therefore, he is\nentitled to be paid salary as per the scale which were admissible to the\nExecutive Officer Class-I. Petitioner has stated that since he had\ndischarged his duties as Executive Officers Class-I the maxim of  Equal\nPay for Equal Work  has to operate in his favour and State is bound to\npay the salary to him as the Executive Officer Grade-I.\nIn reply filed, it has been submitted that till the direct recruits\nCivil Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1989 \nwere to be appointed on the administrative ground, petitioner as\nExecutive Officers Class-II was asked to discharge duties as Executive\nOfficer Grade-I. It has been stated that petitioner was neither appointed\nas Executive Officers Class-I by way of direct recruitment nor by way of\npromotion. If due to the exigencies of situation, an employee, till the new\nincumbent arrived, working in a lower grade is asked to discharge duties\non a similar post having a higher grade as a stop gap arrangement, he\ncannot claim that he should be paid salary according to the higher grade.\nMr. Bhanot states that later all the petitioner was promoted as\nExecutive Officer Class-I.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has relied upon Smt. P.\nGrover v. State of Haryana 1983(2) Services Law Reporter 734, in\nwhich it was held that where a person is promoted and is paid lower\nscale that cannot be sustained. This judgment is of no help to the\npetitioner to the present writ petition as in the present case there was no\npromotional order of the petitioner. He was to only discharge duties till\nthe direct incumbents were appointed. Petitioner was Executive Officer\nof Municipal Committee Grade-II, simply because he was discharging the\nsame duties in Municipal Committee Grade-I, it will not be held that he\nwas discharging the duties of a post which carried some onerous\nresponsibility. \nSimilarly, the other two judgments rendered in Anand Parkash\nv. State of Punjab 2005(3) Recent Services Judgments 749 and\njudgment rendered by learned Single Bench of this Court in Satish\nKumar and Others v. State of Haryana (Civil Writ Petition No. 8615\nof 1991 decided on 20.10.1993) are of no help to the petitioner as in\nCivil Writ Petition No. 2214 of 1989 \nSatish Kumar's case (supra), petitioner was not considered for\npromotion. In the present case, post was meant for direct recruits. Since\nthe petitioner was not discharging duties of higher responsibility,\ntherefore, he is not entitled to the relief sought.\n\nMr. Bhanot states that at the relevant time, services rendered\nin Municipal Committee Grade-I was provincial service and the petitioner\nwas to be selected to become member of Municipal Committee Grade-I.\nHe cannot claim that he should be paid the salary which is due to the\nExecutive Officer discharging the duties of Municipal Grade-I.\n\nIt has been consistently considered and held by this Court that\nonly a regular selection by way of advertisement or from requisition made\nfrom the Employment Exchange shall vest right in the incumbent. A\nperson like petitioner discharging duties will not be entitled to the benefit\nof scale prevailing for that post.\n\nHence, there is no merit in the present petition, same is\ndismissed.\n(Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\n Judge\nDecember 17, 2008\n\n DK"

      "for an injunction restraining R.S.A. No.831 of 1983 -2- them from in any manner interfering with the possession of the property. At the time of institution of suit, there had been merely an agreement of sale but subsequently, the sale deed had been executed on 01.12.1978. The plaintiffs had, therefore, amended the plaint to bring the subsequent event and has sought for a declaration of sale as invalid and void. The trial Court held that the property belonging to Arya Samaj, Alipur but proceeded to dismissed the plaintiffs' suit, who were admittedly not owners. The court found that they had no locus standi to institute the suit in relation to the property belonged to the society. The Appellate Court affirmed the finding that the plaintiffs did not have locus standi but held that the sale had been properly executed on appropriate resolution of the Executive Committee of the Arya Samaj. The plaintiffs were contending that defendants No.2 to 5 have been acting office-bearers of Arya Samaj, Rishi Nagar, Sonepat when the property actually belonged to the Arya Samaj, Alipur. The Appellate Court found that Arya Samaj Alipur Punarsthapit, Sonepat was really the same as Arya Samaj, Alipur and the attempt of the plaintiffs in trying to show that there were two different entities was not justified. The Court also found that the sale had been properly made and there was no scope for interference. . On the basis of pleadings, following substantial questions of law have been framed for consideration in RSA No.831 of 1983:- (i) whether the sale by defendants No.2 to 5 was valid and binding on the Arya Samaj, Alipur on the ground that the defendants No.2 to 5 had the competency to represent the society and bind the society? R.S.A. No.831 of 1983 -3- (ii) whether the plaintiffs, who claimed to be members of the society, the locus standi to impeach the sale by the persons claiming to be the authorized persons to sell the property of the society in favour of 1st defendant? . On the first issue of whether the plaintiff could maintain the action for declaration of injunction, the answer resides in the fact that the provisions of Section 5 and 6 of the Societies Registration Act itself detail as to who could be competent to represent a society and how a suit could be filed by or against a registered society. Admittedly, the suit is filed on the basis that the property belongs to a registered society of Arya Samaj, Alipur. The plaintiffs are two of the life members and the declaration in relation to the property of the society could be done only in the manner contemplated under the provisions of the said Act. It should be first determined as to how the title to the property belonging to a registered society itself could vest. Section 5 of the Societies Registration Act reads thus:- The property, movable and immovable, belonging to a society registered under this Act, if not vested in trustees, shall be deemed to be vested, for the time being, in the governing body of such society, and in all proceedings, civil and criminal, may be described as the property of the governing body of such society by their proper title. . Unlike a company, a society is not a juristic person. In Tata Memorial Hospital Workers Union Vs. Tata Memorial Centre (2010) SCC 480, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the property belonging to a society does not give the society a corporate status in the matter of holding and acquiring property; it merely describes the the property which vests in the trustee or the governing body for the time being. R.S.A. No.831 of 1983 -4- The manner of vesting has also been considered by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dharam Dutt Vs. Union of India (2004) 1 SCC 712. It must, therefore, be seen that the property that belongs to the society must be taken as vesting only on the executive members of the society. . The action of the society of whether the transaction of the sale could be valid nor not, could, therefore, be tested only in the light of what power a registered society has with reference to its properties and the manner of its dealing. If there is no express prohibition contained in the Memorandum of Association or the Bye-laws for dealing with the properties purchased in the name of the society, then it should only be seen that the property that vests in the managing committee could be dealt with by an appropriate resolution. In this case, admittedly there has been a resolution of the society for transfer of the property and it is claimed and not denied by the appllants that one of the plaintiffs himself has been a party to the resolution. It is contended by the plaintiff that a majority decision had been taken for sale of the property and it has been accordingly sold. The sale in favour of the 1st defendant cannot be impeached at the instance of the plaintiffs when the transaction of sale is admittedly supported by a majority resolution of the governing body of the society. The sale would, therefore, bind the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs cannot contest the same by means of a declaratory action. Both as regards the frame of suit as well as the validity of the sale, the lower Appellate Court has correctly considered the matter and I find no reason to interfere with the same. The second appeal filed in RSA No.831 of 1983 shall, therefore, stand dismissed. . The appeal in RSA No.2315 of 1989 is at the instance of the R.S.A. No.831 of 1983 -5- society, which seeks for the relief of injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with the plaintiff's power of management as a President of the Society. At the time of argument to a query whether the plaintiff continues to be a President, the counsel for the appellant states that he has no such instructions and in any event, the same person cannot be a President at this length of time. The relief sought for in the plaint has, by sheer passage of time, become stale and I do not propose to open the issue of the entitlement for the relief of injunction sought at the instance of a person claiming to be the President of the society. No relief is necessary and the appeal in RSA No.2315 of 1989 would require to be dismissed as infructuous and dismissed as such. (K. KANNAN) JUDGE November 04, 2011 Pankaj*"

In Tata\nMemorial Hospital Workers Union Vs. Tata Memorial Centre (2010)\nSCC 480, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that the property belonging\nto a society does not give the society a corporate status in the matter of\nholding and acquiring property; it merely describes the the property\nwhich vests in the trustee or the governing body for the time being.\nR.S.A. No.831 of 1983\n-4-\nThe manner of vesting has also been considered by the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt in Dharam Dutt Vs. Union of India (2004) 1 SCC 712. It must,\ntherefore, be seen that the property that belongs to the society must be\ntaken as vesting only on the executive members of the society.\n.\nThe action of the society of whether the transaction of the\nsale could be valid nor not, could, therefore, be tested only in the light\nof what power a registered society has with reference to its properties\nand the manner of its dealing. If there is no express prohibition\ncontained in the Memorandum of Association or the Bye-laws for dealing\nwith the properties purchased in the name of the society, then it should\nonly be seen that the property that vests in the managing committee\ncould be dealt with by an appropriate resolution. In this case,\nadmittedly there has been a resolution of the society for transfer of the\nproperty and it is claimed and not denied by the appllants that one of\nthe plaintiffs himself has been a party to the resolution. It is contended\nby the plaintiff that a majority decision had been taken for sale of the\nproperty and it has been accordingly sold. The sale in favour of the 1st\ndefendant cannot be impeached at the instance of the plaintiffs when\nthe transaction of sale is admittedly supported by a majority resolution\nof the governing body of the society. The sale would, therefore, bind\nthe plaintiffs and the plaintiffs cannot contest the same by means of a\ndeclaratory action. Both as regards the frame of suit as well as the\nvalidity of the sale, the lower Appellate Court has correctly considered\nthe matter and I find no reason to interfere with the same. The second\nappeal filed in RSA No.831 of 1983 shall, therefore, stand dismissed.\n.\nThe appeal in RSA No.2315 of 1989 is at the instance of the\nR.S.A. No.831 of 1983\n-5-\nsociety, which seeks for the relief of injunction restraining the\ndefendants from interfering with the plaintiff's power of management as\na President of the Society. At the time of argument to a query whether\nthe plaintiff continues to be a President, the counsel for the appellant\nstates that he has no such instructions and in any event, the same\nperson cannot be a President at this length of time. The relief sought\nfor in the plaint has, by sheer passage of time, become stale and I do\nnot propose to open the issue of the entitlement for the relief of\ninjunction sought at the instance of a person claiming to be the\nPresident of the society. No relief is necessary and the appeal in RSA\nNo.2315 of 1989 would require to be dismissed as infructuous and\ndismissed as such.\n(K. KANNAN)\n JUDGE\nNovember 04, 2011\nPankaj*"

No.962 of 1998\n Date of Decision:12.8.2009\n\nZile Singh\n\n petitioner \n Versus \n\nFood Inspector, Narwana District Jind (Haryana)\n\n Respondent \n\nCORAM: HON BLE MR.JUSTICE HARBANS LAL\n\nPresent: Mr.Ankur Malik, Advocate for the petitioner \n\nMr.Amit Kaushik, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana \n\nJUDGMENT \n\nHARBANS LAL, J. \nThis revision is directed against the judgment dated 8.7.1999\npassed by the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge (I), Jind whereby\nhe dismissed the appeal filed by Zile Singh accused against the\njudgment/order of sentence dated 11.12.1997 rendered by the court of Sub\nDivisional Judicial Magistrate, Narwana, vide which he convicted and\nsentenced the aforesaid accused to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a\nperiod of one year and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- under Section 16(1)(a)(i)\nread with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (for\nbrevity  the Act ) and in default of payment of the fine, to further undergo\nrigorous imprisonment for a period of three months.\nThe facts in brief of the prosecution are that Govt. Food\nInspector Khushi Ram Gambhir accompanied by Dr. R.S.Khatri inspected\nthe premises of accused Zile Singh near Laxmi Cinema Narwana on\nCrl.Revn. No.962 of 1998\n.2.1990 at 2.30 P.M. and he was found in possession of about 2 kgs. of\npaneer (Cheese) for public sale contained in an Aluminum tray. The\naforesaid Inspector also joined PW Madan Lal as a witness. After giving a\nnotice Ex.PA, the aforesaid Inspector demanded a sample of paneer.\nThereafter, he purchased 750 grams paneer from the accused on payment of\nRs.24/- vide receipt Ex.PB. The usual formalities were observed. The\ncertificate Ex.PE was issued by Public Analyst Haryana Chandigarh, in\nwhich it was opined that the sample of paneer was found to be adulterated.\nThen the aforesaid Inspector lodged a complaint. \nAfter recording pre-charge evidence, the accused was charged\nunder Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Act, to which he did not\nplead guilty and claimed trial. \nThe learned trial Magistrate after recording the prosecution\nevidence and statement of the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. and\nafter hearing the Government Food Inspector for the State, learned defence\ncounsel and examining the evidence on record, convicted and sentenced the\naccused as noticed at the outset. Feeling aggrieved with his\nconviction/sentence, the petitioner preferred an appeal, which was also\ndismissed by the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Jind. Being\nundaunted and dissatisfied with the judgments rendered by both the courts\nbelow, he has preferred this revision. \nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties, besides\nperusing the record with due care and circumspection.\nRealising that he would not be able to persuade this court to\ntake a view contrary to the findings returned by both the courts below, the\nCrl.Revn. No.962 of 1998\nlearned counsel for the petitioner submitted that he does not wish to assail\nthe conviction. On analysing and scrutinizing the evidence on record, it is\nfound that the judgments recorded by both the courts below cannot be\nfaulted with in any manner. Sequelly, conviction is maintained. At this\njuncture, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner \nhas been facing the agony of trial since 1990 and that being so, his sentence\nmay be reduced to the already undergone. \nI have given a deep and thoughtful consideration to this\nsubmission. Needless to say, this incident is more than 19 years old. As per\nthe custody certificate, taken on record, the petitioner has undergone 2\nmonths and 10 days of the actual sentence. In re:Sadhu Singh versus State\nof Punjab, 2004(1) Recent Criminal Reports (Criminal) 108, the accused\nwas convicted under Section 326 of IPC. The occurrence being 18 years old,\nthe sentence was reduced to the already undergone (one month). An\nidentical view has also been taken in re: Nirmal Singh Versus State of\nPunjab 2005(1) Recent Criminal Reports (Crl.) 477. The petitioner has\nbeen facing the agony of trial since 1990. He has suffered both financial and\nmental agony on account of protracted trial. In my view, the ends of justice\nwould be sufficiently met, if while maintaining the conviction, the sentence\nimposed upon the petitioner is reduced to the already undergone (2 months\nand 10 days). Accordingly, it is reduced to the already undergone (2 months\nand 10 days). \n\nth August, 2009 (Harbans Lal)\ngsv Judge \n\nWhether to be referred to the Reporter ? Yes/No."

JUSTICE HARBANS LAL\nPresent:-\nMr. Varinder Pal Singh, Advocate for the petitioner.\n****\nHARBANS LAL, J.\nThis petition has been moved by the Pepsu Road Transport\nCorporation, Patiala under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India for\nquashing the order dated 24.3.1988 Annexure P.1.\nThe brief facts giving rise to this petition are that Bagga Singh-\nrespondent was placed under suspension on 11.5.1981 for committing\nmisconduct. He was charge-sheeted and a departmental inquiry was held.\nFinally vide order dated 1.7.1985, he was awarded the punishment of\nstoppage of increment with cumulative effect with a further rider that he\nwill not be paid anything over and above the subsistence allowance already\ndrawn by him and the period of his suspension shall not be treated as period\non duty. He filed an application under Section 33-C(2) of Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 (for short, `the Act') claiming the arrears of salary for\nthe suspension period as well as arrears of increment from 7.6.1981 to\n.6.1987 which was opposed. Vide impugned order dated 24.3.1988\nAnnexure P.1, the same was allowed by the Presiding Officer, Labour\nCourt, Bhatinda. \nC.W.P. No.9620 of 1988\n-2-\nNone has come forward to argue on behalf of the respondent-\nBagga Singh.\nI have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, besides\nperusing the findings returned by the learned Presiding Officer, Labour\nCourt with due care and circumspection.\nMr. Varinder Pal Singh, Advocate appearing on behalf of the\npetitioner argued that the workman's right to the relief claimed could not be\ndetermined by the Labour Court under Section 33-C(2) of the Act. He\nfurther puts that the right of Bagga Singh- respondent to receive the arrears\nof salary and treating his suspension period as on duty with effect from\n.11.1981 was neither existing nor settled and that being so, the\njurisdiction of the Labour Court was barred to hear the application.\nI have well considered these submissions. Of course, as ruled\nin re: M.D., Oswal Hosiery (Regd.) v. D.D. Gupta, 1994 LLR 487 (Del.),\n once there is an admission of the existing right of the workman by the\nemployer in regard to the benefit which the former is entitled to and receive\nfrom the later, section 33-C(2) of the Act would come into play.  Here in\nthis case, it is to be determined as to whether there was any such admission\non the part of the Corporation. The learned Presiding Officer, Labour\nCourt, Bhatinda has observed in the impugned award as under:-\n ii)\nThe workman was placed under suspension on\n.5.1981. His suspension till 10-11-1981 is lawful\naccording to Regulation No.24 ibid w.e.f. 11.11.1981,\nthe workman was entitled to full wages because he could\nnot be kept under suspension beyond a period of six\nmonths. He is thus entitled to wages over and above the\nC.W.P. No.9620 of 1988\n-3-\nsubsistence allowance from 11.1.1981 to 4.3.1985. Such\narrears of wages have been claimed at the rate of\nRs.135/- P.M. The management has not challenged the\nrate at which the workman has claimed the arrears. The\namount of arrears under this head from 11.11.1981 to\n.3.1985 work out to Rs.6570/-.\niii)\nUnder Regulation No.13(5) of the Regulations, the\nperiod of suspension is not to count towards increments.\nThe increment of Rs.15/- which had otherwise fallen\ndue on 7.6.1981 thus was deferred by a period of six\nmonths i.e., the period of legal suspension. The\nincrement thus fell due on 7.12.1981. Arrears of\nincremental arrears from 7.12.81 to 5.6.1982 @ Rs.15/-\nP.M. work out to Rs.90/-.\n(iv)\nThe next annual increments of Rs.20/- P.M. each fell due\nrespectively on 7.6.1982, 7.6.1983, 7.6.1984 and 7.6.85\nand 7.6.86 and the workman was entitled to receive from\nthe employer arrears @ Rs.35/- (15+20) i.e., Rs.420/- till\n.6.83 @ Rs.55/- (35+20) i.e. 660/- till 6.6.84, Rs.75/-\n(55+20) i.e., Rs.900/- till 6.6.85, Rs.95/- (Rs.75+20) i.e.,\n/- till 6.6.1986 and @ Rs.115/- (95+20) i.e.,\nRs.1380 till 6.6.87, in all Rs.4300/-. I thus hold that a\ntotal sum of Rs.10,960/- is due by the Respondent to the\nworkman. \nIt is quite plain and patent from the above observations that the\nmanagement has not challenged the rate at which the workman has claimed\nC.W.P. No.9620 of 1988\n-4-\nthe arrears. So, ostensibly, it tantamounts to admission of the existing right\nof the workman   respondent. Sequelly, I do not consider it proper to\ninterfere with the impugned award in the exercise of writ jurisdiction under\nArticles 226/227 of the Constitution of India. Hence, this petition is\ndismissed.\nOctober 21, 2008\n ( HARBANS LAL )\nrenu\nJUDGE\nWhether to be referred to the Reporter? Yes/No"

It further appears that while the inquiry proceedings\nwere near completion, one of the charge-sheeted employee (Harpal Singh)\nfiled CWP No.114 of 1987 challenging the disciplinary proceedings\ninitiated against him. No stay was, however, granted by this Court against\nthe inquiry proceedings but passing of the final order was stayed.\nMeanwhile, the inquiry officer had submitted the report but no further\naction on that basis was taken against the petitioner or those employees in\nwhose favour there was no interim order passed by this Court.\nIn sum and substance, the petitioner wanted that the\ndisciplinary proceedings should be finalized as he was expecting his\nexoneration, which would have made him entitled to claim the arrears of\nsalary during the period he remained under suspension, as also\nconsideration for further promotion.\nThis writ petition was filed in the year 1992. More than 16\nyears have passed thereafter. There is every possibility that by now, the\ndisciplinary proceedings have come to an end and whatever consequential\nbenefits might have been found due, have also been released in favour of\nthe petitioner.\nBe that as it may, having regard to the nature of relief sought in\nthis writ petition, the same is disposed of with a direction to the Markfed to\ntake a final decision in the disciplinary proceedings, if the same has not\nbeen taken so far, and if such a decision has already been taken and the\npetitioner has been exonerated, to consider his claim for all the\nconsequential benefits including the promotion, arrears of pay, etc. as early\nCWP No.2188 of 1991 -: 3 :-\nas possible but not later than four months from the date of receipt of a\ncertified copy of this order. \nThese directions shall not be taken as an expression on the\nmerits of the allegations levelled against the petitioner.\nDecember 22, 2008.\n [ Surya Kant ]\nkadyan\n Judge"

The final order of resumption in\nchallenge is the one passed by the Advisor to the Administrator\nrecording the fact that the violations which had been pointed out, had not\nbeen removed and, therefore, the property was liable for resumption.\n.\nThe contention of the petitioners was that some of the\nviolations which had been pointed out, could not be removed in view of\nthe properties being in the possession of the tenants, who had taken\nindependent pleas complaining that the land owners were colluding with\nthe administration to oust them from possession by deliberately suffering\nan order of eviction. All the tenants in possession have been cited as\nrespondents 6 to 8. The petitioners and the tenants have a common\nground to canvass at the time when the writ petition is finally taken up to\nurge that the deviations which had been pointed out and which were\ntaken as a basis for actions for resumption have since ceased or become\ncompoundable. At the time when the order of resumption had been\npassed, the following violations had been pointed out:-\n 1.\nDirect entry to basement from public verandah has\nbeen provided which is not as per sanctioned plan.\n.\nAdditional partitions is also done there.\n.\nBig show windows in right side verandah have been\ndivided into small show windows.\n.\nStair position from right side verandah is shifted at\nthe back verandah against the plans and instead of round\nsquare pills are constructed. \nCivil Writ Petition No.4421 of 1989\n- 3 -\nOf the above 5 items of deviations, item No.2 refers to a conversion and\ndivision of a kitchen into a toilet and a small shop with entry from public\nverandah. The 2nd respondent has given an affidavit stating that the\nsecond violation had been removed and he had given an undertaking that\nhe will pay the necessary compounding fee for violations 1, 3, 4 and 5\nreferred to above. Having regard to the subsequent event and the change\nof regulations relating to some of the deviations as compoundable, the\norder of resumption is set aside and the administration shall be at liberty\nto make an inspection of the property and ensure that deviation No.2\ncomplained of has since been removed as affirmed in the affidavit. The\nadministration shall be at liberty to assess the compounding fee as\npermissible under rules and make a demand specifying the amounts and\nthe petitioners shall be bound to make the payment. Any default on their\npart will result in the consequences which the regulations provide for.\nThe writ petition is allowed on the above terms. The affidavit given by\nShri Mohan Singh, is taken on record and shall form part of the record. \nCivil Writ Petition Nos.16737 and 17084 of 1989\n.\nIn these two writ petitions, the petitiones are the tenants of\nthe very same premises i.e. SCO Nos.70 to 72 in Sector 17-D,\nChandigarh and the benefit of cancellation of the resumption order\nwould avail to the benefit of the petitioners also. The writ petitions filed\nby them are also allowed on the above terms. \n`\n(K.KANNAN)\n JUDGE\n.04.2010\nsanjeev"

(Oral)\nIn the present writ petition, challenge is to the award dated\n.3.1992 (Annexure P-9) vide which the Labour Court has come to the\nconclusion that the services of the workmen have not been terminated and\nthey were very much the employees of the respondent-Management and,\nthus, the dispute as sought to be raised by the workmen did not exist as the\nenquiry proceedings were going on against them. Thus, the reference being\npre-mature, it was answered against the workmen and in favour of the\nManagement.\nCounsel for the petitioners contends that the Labour Court has\ngone beyond the reference. He contends that the reference was whether\ntermination of services of the 23 workmen who had preferred a demand\nnotice on which references were sent for adjudication to the Labour Court,\nC.W.P.No.5829 of 1993\n-2-\nwas justified and in order and if not, to what relief/exact amount of\ncompensation each of them is entitled to. He contends that the Labour\nCourt instead of adjudicating upon the reference made to it has proceeded to\nhold that there was no termination of the workmen and in view of this, the\nreference was pre-mature. He submits that the workmen had not been\nallowed to work in the factory and they were not allowed to enter the\npremises due to which they could not perform their duties. This would\nlead to only one conclusion that their services had been terminated by the\nManagement. He submits that this termination was abrupt without holding\nany proper enquiry as neither any notice was given nor any charge-sheet\nwas issued nor any retrenchment compensation paid to them. Therefore, he\ncontends that the termination is not in accordance with law and the\nprovisions governing the services of the workmen i.e. the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 have been violated with impunity. He relies upon the\nstatements of the workmen to contend that they have categorically stated\nbefore the Labour Court that they have not been allowed to continue in\nservice as they were not allowed to perform their duties. In this view of the\nmatter, he submits that the award passed by the Labour Court cannot be\nsustained as the requirement of the reference was to adjudicate upon the\nissues as to whether the termination of the services of the workmen was in\norder and to what relief and amount of compensation they were entitled to.\nThat having not been done, the present writ petition deserves to be allowed.\nHe further relies upon an award dated 21.12.1992 (Annexure P-10) passed\nby the Labour Court, Jalandhar, of a co-worker wherein a reference\npreferred by a similarly situated employee had been answered in favour of\nthe workmen although the same grounds which have been taken by the\nC.W.P.No.5829 of 1993\n-3-\nemployer as in the case of the petitioners were rejected by the Labour Court.\nHe further contends that a writ petition preferred by the respondent-\nManagement against this award i.e. C.W.P.No.7289 of 1993 was dismissed\nby a Division Bench of this Court on 12.1.1994. However, liberty was\ngranted to the Management to proceed with the enquiry referred to in the\naward and to pass such order as it deemed appropriate in accordance with\nlaw. He, on this basis, presses that similar relief be granted to the\npetitioners. \nCounsel for the respondent, on the other hand, contends that the\npresent writ petition with regard to petitioners No.21 and 22 is not\nmaintainable as both these workmen had not appeared before the Labour\nCourt to support their assertions made in their demand notice. This factual\nposition having not been disputed by the counsel for the petitioner, writ\npetition on behalf of petitioners No.21 and 22 Vas Dev, Typist Yashpal\nSingh, Turner respectively, is held to be not maintainable and dismissed as\nsuch on the ground that the Labour Court in its award itself has on this very\nground answered the reference against these petitioners.\nCounsel for the respondent has further submitted that the award\npassed by the Labour Court is in accordance with law. He submits that\nbefore the Conciliation Officer the stand of the Management was that the\nworkmen have been charge-sheeted and enquiry proceedings were pending\nagainst them and the record in that regard was also produced before the\nConciliation Officer. He contends that the stand of the Management from\nthe very inception was that the services of the workmen have not been\nterminated and since the workmen were still in service when the reference\nwas made, there could have been no dispute under Section 10 of the Act.\nC.W.P.No.5829 of 1993\n-4-\nAfter the said reference had been made by the Appropriate Government, the\nLabour Court on going through the records and the evidence led before it,\nhas come to a conclusion that the reference was pre-mature on the ground\nthat the termination of the workmen was not there.\nI have heard learned counsel for the parties and with their able\nassistance have gone through the records of the case as well as the\nimpugned award. A perusal of the same would clearly show that MW-1\nShri Ranjit Singh, a Clerk of the local Labour Office, had appeared before\nthe Labour Court and produced the records of the conciliation proceedings\nin the form of Exhibit M-1. Shri J.K.Sehgal, MW-2 had appeared before the\nLabour Court and produced various documents showing the charge-sheets\nand the notices issued to different workmen in relation to initiation of\ndomestic enquiries against them. Even during the pendency of the\nproceedings before the Labour Court, it is apparent that the enquiries were\npending before the workmen. The workmen in their cross-examination have\nadmitted that show cause notices and charge-sheets regarding initiation of\nenquiries against them were either received by them or the said charge-\nsheets were dispatched on their correct addresses. However, this does\nindicate that the workmen were aware of the domestic enquiries being\ninitiated and continuation thereof against them. Despite this knowledge, the\nworkmen had proceeded to raise an industrial dispute claiming therein that\ntheir services have been terminated. The finding as recorded by the Labour\nCourt, therefore, cannot be faulted with that the reference was pre-mature as\nthe services of the workmen were not terminated on the date(s) alleged by\nthem or on the date(s) when the reference was made. That being so, the\nonly conclusion which can be arrived at and has rightly been reached by the\nC.W.P.No.5829 of 1993\n-5-\nLabour Court is that the reference was pre-mature. That being the position,\nno illegality can be said to have been committed by the Labour Court in\npassing Award dated 21.12.1992 (Annexure P-9).\nThe contention of the counsel for the petitioners that in the case\nof similarly placed employees, the reference has been answered in favour of\nthe workmen and against the Management although the grounds taken\ntherein were on the same lines as in the present proceedings. A perusal of\nthe said award ( Annexure P-10) would show that the Court has proceeded\nto decide the case as per the pleadings before the said Court. This order,\nwhen challenged before this Court in C.W.P.No.7289 of 1993 which came\nto be decided on 12.1.1994, this order also says that the enquiries which\nhas been referred to in the award were still continuing against the workmen\nand the Court has also given liberty to the Management to proceed with the\nenquiries and to pass such orders as it deems appropriate in accordance with\nlaw. This further shows that as a matter of fact, there was no termination in\nthat case as well. However, this Court in exercise of its discretionary\npowers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India refrained itself from\nexercising its writ jurisdiction. \nIn view of the above, the present writ petition is without any\nmerit and is hereby dismissed.\nHowever, a liberty is given to the Management to proceed in\naccordance with the findings, if any, against the workmen.\nFebruary 11, 2009\n\n ( AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH )\npoonam\n JUDGE\n\nWhether referred to Reporters ________ Yes/No"

As per facts on record, land was acquired for a\npublic purpose, namely, for the development and utilisation of land as\nresidential and commercial area for Sector 30 at Gurgaon.\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 3759 OF 1991\n-2-\nHeard counsel for the parties.\nIn this writ petition, it is specific case of the petitioners that in\nthe land under their ownership, they have constructed the residential\nhouses. It is contended by counsel for the petitioner that discrimination has\nbeen done to the petitioner by not releasing their land, whereas a vast track\nof land was released in favour of a Company known as M/S Unitech Ltd.\nTo show that the construction was in existence, when notification under\nSection 4 of the Act was issued, reference was made to an averment made in\npara No. 4 of the writ petition, wherein it is only stated that the petitioner's\nresidential house is in existence in the land in dispute. To the contrary, in\nparagraph No. 2 of the writ petition, it is stated that the nature of the land\nowned by the petitioner was agricultural. Detail of the construction is not\ngiven. It has also come on record that when opportunity given, petitioner\nfailed to file any objection under Section 5-A of the Act. \n In the reply filed, it has been stated as under:\n 1. That the petitioner has not come to the court with clean\nhands at all. The petitioner had alleged in para No. 4 of the\nCivil Writ Petition that he has constructed a house on the land\nin dispute. In fact, the land in dispute was completely vacant at\nthe time of the issuance of the3 notification u/s 4 of the Land\nAcquisition Act. A survey was conducted fully in accordance\nwith law and the land in dispute was completely vacant at the\nrelevant time. Thus, the allegations regarding construction are\ntotally false and concocted. The petitioner has made false\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 3759 OF 1991\n-3-\nallegations with malafide intentions. The Civil Writ Petition\nmerits dismissal on this ground alone.\n. That the petitioner has not filed any objections u/s 5-A of the\nLand Acquisition Act at all. The petitioner has got no right to\nchallenge the acquisition proceedings at this stage. The Civil\nWrit Petition filed by the petitioner merits dismissal on this sole\nground \nThe respondents have taken a specific stand in the reply that\nwhen land was ordered to be acquired, it was lying vacant and further that\npetitioner has not raised any objection to the proposed acquisition. To the\nwritten-statement, replication was not filed to show that the construction\nwas in existence. Even photographs of the alleged construction were not\nput on record. So far as ground of discrimination is concerned, the same is\nalso not available to the petitioner. In the reply filed, it is stated that the\nland was released in favour of M/S Unitech Pvt. Ltd. Because a licence to\ndevelop that land, as a colony, has already been sanctioned in favour of the\nsaid company. As the petitioners have failed to file objections under Section\n-A of the Act, in view of ratio of judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nin Delhi Administration v. Gurdip Singh Uban and others , AIR 1999\nSupreme Court 3822, this writ petition is not maintainable.\nIn view of facts, mentioned above, no case is made out for\ninterference. Dismissed. \n\n( Jasbir Singh )\n Judge\n (Rakesh Kumar Garg)\nMarch 17 , 2011. \nJudge\nDKC"

It appears that both these applications were taken up together by the learned Sub Judge Ist Class, Chandigarh, for consideration. The trial Court framed the following issues:- . Whether the award dated 11.10.1985 is liable to be set aside? OPA . Relief. While considering issue No.1, it has been held that the objections are not sustainable. The challenge to the ward was made on two counts: (i) that the Arbitrator was appointed by designation and he has passed the award even after his transfer from the post of Additional Director, Industries, Haryana, (ii) that the Arbitrator has made the award beyond the period of four months. Both these objections have been rejected. It was found that the Arbitrator was by name and he was competent to proceed with the matter even after his transfer. As regards the question of limitation is concerned, it has been specifically held that the Arbitrator entered on the reference on .06.1985 and award was made on 11.10.1985, within the statutory period of four months. The objections were, thus, rightly rejected. As per the application filed by the petitioner for making the award the rule of the Court is concerned, the same has been dismissed having been filed beyond the period of 30 days. It has come on record that the State made an application on .12.1985 to the Arbitrator for copy of the award. The copy of the CR No.3981 of 1991 : 3 : award was made available to the petitioner on 23.1.1986, whereas the present application under Sections 14 and 17 of the Arbitration Act came to be filed on 21.2.1986. The learned Sub Judge Ist Class, Chandigarh, has rejected the application being barred by limitation on the ground that the limitation commenced from the date of the making of the award. Article 119 of the Limitation Act (Part-I: Applications in specified cases) governed the period of limitation and reads as under:- (a) for the filing in Court of an award (b) for setting aside an award or getting an award remitted for reconsideration.

From the above Article, it is apparent that the limitation commenced from the date of notice of the making of the award. In the present case, there is no material on record to indicate that the petitioner had the notice of the award. The learned Trial Court has simply drawn an inference without there being any material on record. The clear averment made in the petition that copy of the award was received on 23.1.1986 and the petitioner had filed the application only on 21.02.1986 within limitation. Apart from the above, the petitioner had only asked for the making of the award rule of the Court and there was no prayer to the Court for filing of the award. The order passed by the learned Sub Judge Ist Class, Chandigarh, was assailed by the petitioner before the learned Additional District Judge,Chandigarh, CR No.3981 of 1991 : 4 : who has also dismissed the appeal affirming the judgment of the learned trial Court. In view of the above, this petition is allowed. The impugned orders are set aside. The matter is remitted back to the learned trial Court for taking a fresh decision on merits.

      "in the case of Gurpal Tuli and others v. State of Punjab and others, AIR 1984 Supreme Court , the action of withdrawing instructions dated 23.7.1957 was upheld and in para 9 and 10, their lordships made following observations:- 9. It appears that several teachers filed writ petitions in the High Court claiming revised scales of pay on the ground that they had taken graduate degrees and, therefore, were entitled to the benefit of the grade mentioned against Category `A' in the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957. In opposition to the writ petitions, the State Government contended that the letter did not contemplate the grant of the grade to all teachers but only to teachers appointed as Masters. The High Court held the teachers entitled to the benefit of the revised grade, whether or not they had been appointed as Masters, because, in the opinion of the High Court, the qualifying criterion was the possession of a graduate degree. The judgment of the High Court was affirmed by this Court in Kirpal Singh Bhatia (AIR 1976 SC 2459) (supra). The State Government found it difficult, having regard to the prevailing burden on its financial resources, to extend the benefit of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 to the much wider section of teachers covered in consequence of the Court's judgment. Accordingly, the State Government issued Circular letter No.9/9/79-FR(2)/143 dated February 19, 1979, paragraph C.W.P. No.7240 of 1989 -3- of which stated that in order to ensure that these unintended and large financial implications do not continue arising in future the whole matter had been reconsidered by the State Government and as a result the Government ordered that henceforth the teachers of the Education Department would not automatically be entitled to placement in the higher scales of pay in terms of paragraph 3 of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957 by the mere circumstance of their improving or acquiring higher qualifications in the course of their service. The rigour of the restriction was relaxed in some measure. Paragraph 3 said further:- However, in order to avoid discrimination between teachers who have already been allowed higher scales of pay on account of having improved their qualifications and those who have not yet been allowed this benefit even though they also possess higher qualifications it is decided that all teachers in the Education Department who have improved their qualifications before the issue of this letter may be allowed the benefit of higher scale of pay on the basis of their qualifications. The benefit was not extended to those who were appointed or who had improved their qualifications after the issue of that Circular letter. The teachers continued to agitate for a more generous dispensation. The State C.W.P. No.7240 of 1989 -4- Government then issued Circular letter No.8937-5ED. /2659 dated September 20, 1979, which declared:- The implementation of the decision contained in Finance Department circular letter No.9/9/79 FR (2)/143 dated February 19, 1979 to grant higher pay scales to the teachers on the basis of higher qualifications was kept pending for want of clarification on certain points from the Finance Department which has now become available is reproduced below:- . The higher scale may be allowed from the date of passing the respective higher examination by the concerned teacher where this has already been done. However, actual payment at enhanced rates should commence from 12-2-79 and the payment of arrears accruing from the date of passing the examination till 13-2-1979 be restricted to the maximum for 38 months. . The benefit of the higher scale may be allowed from the date a particular teacher is appointed on regular basis or the date of passing the higher examination, whichever is later, but the payment of arrears as a result of grant of such benefit should be restricted to a period of 38 months only, as already C.W.P. No.7240 of 1989 -5- mentioned above. . The teachers placed in the higher scale can only be regularly adjusted when corresponding posts in the higher scale become available; in that case such teachers may continue to enjoy the higher scale as a personal measure till they are adjusted against regular posts as and when the same become available. . It was clarified that the contemplated benefit was confined to the categories of teachers mentioned in the Circular letter No.5058.FR-II-57/5600 dated July 23, . In all the writ petitions, the petitioners have acquired post graduate qualification after 19.2.1979. According to the instructions dated .2.1979, the teachers of the Education Department would not automatically be entitled to placement in the higher scale of pay in terms of para 3 of the circular letter dated 23.7.1957 by virtue of merely acquiring higher qualification in the course of their service. However, on 20.9.1979, a clarification was issued that those who had acquired the qualification before .2.1979 and were appointed would be entitled to the grant of benefits in terms of letter dated 23.7.1957 subject to further conditions. It is thus evident that the benefits in lieu of higher qualification acquired after .2.1979 would not be available to the petitioners who have admittedly acquired post graduate qualification much later. The writ petitions are wholly misconceived and are thus liable to be dismissed. C.W.P. No.7240 of 1989 -6- For the reasons afore-mentioned, these writ petitions fails and same are dismissed.

Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment?\n. To be referred to the Reporter or not?\n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?\nM.M. KUMAR, J.\nThis order shall dispose of C.W.P. No.9005 of 1989, C.W.P.\nNo.7240 of 1990, C.W.P. No.15102 of 1990 and C.W.P. No.1590 of 1991\nas the common question of law and fact have been raised. The petitioners\nhave claimed higher pay/ higher pay scale in lieu of acquisition of higher\nqualification. Their claim is founded on instructions dated 23.7.1957.\nThose instructions had granted benefit of higher basic or increments as and\nwhen teacher/ masters have acquired higher educational qualifications.\nThose instructions were withdrawn on 19.2.1979 and the pay-scale were de-\nlinked from the higher qualification. According to the instructions dated\n.2.1979, the pay-scale of teacher/ masters were required to be fixed\nC.W.P. No.7240 of 1989\n-2-\naccording to the post held by them. The litigation between the teachers/\nmaster travelled to Hon'ble the Supreme Court and in the case of Gurpal\nTuli and others v. State of Punjab and others, AIR 1984 Supreme Court\n, the action of withdrawing instructions dated 23.7.1957 was upheld\nand in para 9 and 10, their lordships made following observations:-\n 9.\nIt appears that several teachers filed writ petitions in the\nHigh Court claiming revised scales of pay on the ground\nthat they had taken graduate degrees and, therefore, were\nentitled to the benefit of the grade mentioned against\nCategory `A' in the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957. In\nopposition to the writ petitions, the State Government\ncontended that the letter did not contemplate the grant of\nthe grade to all teachers but only to teachers appointed as\nMasters. The High Court held the teachers entitled to the\nbenefit of the revised grade, whether or not they had been\nappointed as Masters, because, in the opinion of the High\nCourt, the qualifying criterion was the possession of a\ngraduate degree. The judgment of the High Court was\naffirmed by this Court in Kirpal Singh Bhatia (AIR 1976\nSC 2459) (supra). The State Government found it\ndifficult, having regard to the prevailing burden on its\nfinancial resources, to extend the benefit of the Circular\nletter dated July 23, 1957 to the much wider section of\nteachers covered in consequence of the Court's judgment.\nAccordingly, the State Government issued Circular letter\nNo.9/9/79-FR(2)/143 dated February 19, 1979, paragraph\nC.W.P. No.7240 of 1989\n-3-\nof which stated that in order to ensure that  these\nunintended and large financial implications do not\ncontinue arising in future  the whole matter had been\nreconsidered by the State Government and as a result the\nGovernment ordered that henceforth the teachers of the\nEducation Department would not automatically be\nentitled to placement in the higher scales of pay in terms\nof paragraph 3 of the Circular letter dated July 23, 1957\nby the mere circumstance of their improving or acquiring\nhigher qualifications in the course of their service. The\nrigour of the restriction was relaxed in some measure.\nParagraph 3 said further:-\n However, in order to avoid discrimination between\nteachers who have already been allowed higher\nscales of pay on account of having improved their\nqualifications and those who have not yet been\nallowed this benefit even though they also possess\nhigher qualifications it is decided that all teachers in\nthe Education Department who have improved their\nqualifications before the issue of this letter may be\nallowed the benefit of higher scale of pay on the\nbasis of their qualifications. \nThe benefit was not extended to those who were\nappointed or who had improved their qualifications after\nthe issue of that Circular letter. The teachers continued\nto agitate for a more generous dispensation. The State\nC.W.P. No.7240 of 1989\n-4-\nGovernment then issued Circular letter No.8937-5ED.\n/2659 dated September 20, 1979, which declared:-\n The implementation of the decision contained in\nFinance Department circular letter No.9/9/79 FR\n(2)/143 dated February 19, 1979 to grant higher pay\nscales to the teachers on the basis of higher\nqualifications was kept pending for want of\nclarification on certain points from the Finance\nDepartment which has now become available is\nreproduced below:-\n.\nThe higher scale may be allowed from the\ndate of passing the respective higher\nexamination by the concerned teacher where\nthis has already been done. However, actual\npayment at enhanced rates should commence\nfrom 12-2-79 and the payment of arrears\naccruing from the date of passing the\nexamination till 13-2-1979 be restricted to\nthe maximum for 38 months.\n.\nThe benefit of the higher scale may be\nallowed from the date a particular teacher is\nappointed on regular basis or the date of\npassing the higher examination, whichever is\nlater, but the payment of arrears as a result of\ngrant of such benefit should be restricted to a\nperiod of 38 months only, as already\nC.W.P. No.7240 of 1989\n-5-\nmentioned above.\n.\nThe teachers placed in the higher scale can\nonly be regularly adjusted when\ncorresponding posts in the higher scale\nbecome available; in that case such teachers\nmay continue to enjoy the higher scale as a\npersonal measure till they are adjusted\nagainst regular posts as and when the same\nbecome available. \n.\nIt was clarified that the contemplated benefit was\nconfined to the categories of teachers mentioned in the\nCircular letter No.5058.FR-II-57/5600 dated July 23,\n. \nIn all the writ petitions, the petitioners have acquired post\ngraduate qualification after 19.2.1979. According to the instructions dated\n.2.1979, the teachers of the Education Department would not\nautomatically be entitled to placement in the higher scale of pay in terms of\npara 3 of the circular letter dated 23.7.1957 by virtue of merely acquiring\nhigher qualification in the course of their service. However, on 20.9.1979, a\nclarification was issued that those who had acquired the qualification before\n.2.1979 and were appointed would be entitled to the grant of benefits in\nterms of letter dated 23.7.1957 subject to further conditions. It is thus\nevident that the benefits in lieu of higher qualification acquired after\n.2.1979 would not be available to the petitioners who have admittedly\nacquired post graduate qualification much later. The writ petitions are\nwholly misconceived and are thus liable to be dismissed. \nC.W.P. No.7240 of 1989\n-6-\nFor the reasons afore-mentioned, these writ petitions fails and\nsame are dismissed.\nApril 29, 2009\n\n ( M.M. KUMAR )\nrenu\n JUDGE"

These references have emerged from identical orders dated\n.11.1994, passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal,\nChandigarh Bench (for brevity,  the Tribunal ) in ITA Nos.\n/Chandi/1989; 1076/Chandi/1989; and 1042/Chandi/1989, in\nITR Nos. 17, 18 and 22 of 1996\nrespect of Assessment Year 1982-83 in the cases of the respondent-\nassessee(s). At the instance of the revenue, the Tribunal has\nreferred identical question of law for the opinion of this Court by\nexercising jurisdiction under Section 256(1) of the Income-tax Act,\n(for brevity,  the Act ). The question of law framed in ITR No.\nof 1996 reads as under:-\n Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the\ncase, the Appellate Tribunal was right in holding that the\nshare income attributable to 40% of the assessee s right,\ntitle and interest of her share income in M/s Munjal Gases\nwas to be excluded from the assessee s total income? \n.\nAt the outset, learned counsel for the revenue has fairly\nstated that the above mentioned question of law has already been\nanswered by this Court against the revenue and in favour of the\nassessee in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax (Central)\nLudhiana v. Pawan Kant (ITR No. 7 of 1989, Assessment Year 1981-\n, decided on 30.8.2004). In Pawan Kant s case (supra) the\nDivision Bench in turn noticed that the question of law, in fact,\nstands already decided by this Court in the case of Commissioner of\nIncome Tax v. Bhagat Singh, (1998) 229 ITR 239, wherein it has\nbeen held that the assets received by an assessee on partition and\naccretion thereto upto the date of marriage of the assessee did not\ncease to be HUF property and the income of such property was\nassessable in the hands of the HUF constituted by him with his\ndaughter. The plea of the revenue that there must be atleast two\nmale members to form a HUF as taxable entity was specifically\nrejected. Following the said judgment and agreeing with the view\nITR Nos. 17, 18 and 22 of 1996\ntaken by the Tribunal, the Division Bench in Pawan Kant s case\n(supra) has summed up as under:\n \nRespectfully following the aforesaid judgment, we\nare of the view that the Tribunal was right in holding that\nthe property received by the assessee on partition of the\nHUF continues to be joint family property in his hands\nand the income therefrom after his marriage was\nassessable in the hands of the HUF constituted by him\nwith his wife. Similar view has also been expressed by a\nFull Bench of the Patna High Court in Commissioner of\nIncome-Tax v. Shankar Lal Budhia, (1987) 165 I.T.R. 380\nand by the Full Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court\nin Commissioner of Income-Tax, M.P. 1 v. Krishan Kumar,\n(1983) 143 I.T.R. 462. Accordingly, the question is\nanswered in the affirmative i.e. in favour of the assessee\nand against the revenue. \n.\nRespectfully following the opinion expressed by the\nDivision Bench of this Court in the case of Pawan Kant (supra), the\nreferred question is decided against the revenue and in favour of\nthe assessee(s).\n.\nThe references are disposed of.\n.\nA photocopy of this order be placed on the files of\nconnected cases.\n(M.M.

(oral)\nJUDGMENT\nThis writ petition has been filed with a prayer to modify award\ndated August 10, 1987, vide which compensation, for the acquired land, was\ngranted to the petitioner at the rate of Rs. 8/- per square yard.\nHeard counsel for the parties. It is apparent from the record\nthat about 19 Kanals of land of the petitioner was sought to be acquired by\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 8639 OF 1989\n-2-\nissuing a Notification under Section 36 of the Punjab Town Improvement\nAct, 1922 (in short 1922 Act) on September 16, 1969. Notification under\nSection 42 (2) of the 1922 Act was issued on March 7, 1972. The Land\nAcquisition Collector, Bhiwani, vide Award dated January 19, 1973, fixed\nmarket price of the land in question at Rs. 1.25 per square yard excluding\ncompensation for the structures. The petitioner was not satisfied. He\nmoved an application under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894\nfor enhancement of compensation, which was allowed by the Tribunal\nconstituted under the 1922 Act vide order dated August 10, 1987 and\ncompensation amount was enhanced to Rs. 8/- per square yard. Even then\nthe petitioner was not satisfied. He came to this Court by filing this writ\npetition.\nIt is primary contention of counsel for the petitioner that the\nTribunal has not taken note of the potential value of the land under\nacquisition for its development towards commercial and residential use and\nfurther that the evidence produced was not appreciated properly especially\njudgment passed by this Court ( Ex.P-21) on November 25, 1981, awarding\ncompensation for the adjoining land at the rate of Rs. 14/- per square yard.\nMadan Singh, Clerk, Improvement Trust (PW2) deposed that land is\nsituated on Bhiwani Circular Road, next to the Adarsh College and opposite\nto the Bus Stand. It was also so reiterated by Ghansham Dass (PW3) who\nhad been working in the Municipal Committee, Bhiwani. He has\nspecifically stated that the land falls within the Municipal limits and is\nsituated next to the General Bus Stand. To know the situation of land,\nwhich was subject matter of judgment dated November 25, 1989 (Ex. P-21),\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 8639 OF 1989\n-3-\nwe passed the following order on August 31, 2010:\n At the time of arguments, to enhance compensation, reliance\nhas been placed upon a judgment of this Court, copy of which\nis Ex. P-21.\nIt is contention of the counsel for the petitioner that the land,\nwhich was subject matter of judgment Ex. P-21, is situated in\nthe near vicinity of the land, which was subject matter of\nacquisition in this writ petition.\nTo settle the equities, we deem it proper to direct the\nImprovement Trust to put on record site plan showing the\nsituation at the spot of the land, which is subject matter of this\nacquisition and also situation of the land, which was subject\nmatter of acquisition in judgments Ex. P-21 and Ex. P-7, which\nare found mentioned in paragraph No. 25 of the impugned\nAward. \nSite plan has been produced in Court today, which clearly\nindicates that the land in dispute, in this case, is situated on the main road\nand adjoins the land which was subject matter of judgment Ex. P-21 , which\nis situated at its back side. The potential of the land in dispute, as per\nsituation at the spot, is much more as compared to the land, which was\nacquired by issuing a notification under Section 36 of the 1922 Act on\nMarch 12, 1973. It appears that the Tribunal has not relied upon that\ninstance, to grant compensation because the land was acquired after about 3\n  years from the date when land in dispute was acquired. Vide the\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 8639 OF 1989\n-4-\njudgment, mentioned above, the compensation of that land was enhanced to\nRs. 14/- per square yard. Taking note of the situation of the land in this case\nand its proximity to the Bus Stand, and a College and also a fact that it is\nsituated within the Municipal limits, we are of the view that the\ncompensation awarded is on the lower side. We propose to take note of the\ncompensation awarded vide judgment (Ex. P-21) dated November\n\n,\n. In the said case, land was acquired 3   years after the land in dispute\nwas acquired. In view of that, we decide to deduct Rs. 4/- towards\nescalation in prices in the meantime and grant Rs. 10/- per square yard\ntowards compensation in this case. The amount granted towards other\nstatutory benefits by the Tribunal is maintained.\nWith above said modification, this writ petition stands disposed\nof. Respondent- Improvement Trust is directed to make payment of the\ncompensation amount within a period of two months.\n\n( JASBIR SINGH )\nJUDGE\n(AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH)\nJUDGE\nDecember 16 , 2010. \nDKC"

The Insurance\nCompany cannot, therefore, sustain the appeal jointly with the insured.\nIn the light of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chinnama\nGeorge and others Versus N.K.Raju and another-(2000) 4 SCC 130,\nthe Insurance Company is transposed as respondent and the Registry\nshall carry out the transposition and array the Insurance Company as 4th\nrespondent. \nFAO No.1513 of 1992\n- 2 -\n.\nIf the case must be treated as an appeal by the insured only,\nthe issue has to be considered with reference to the evidence available as\nregards the salary of the deceased. The deceased was a Veterinary\nSurgeon at Government Piggery Farm, Ambala and the salary certificate\nhas been filed showing that he was drawing Rs.3,895/-. It was elicited in\nevidence that he had put in 7 years of service and the Tribunal had taken\nthe monthly contribution to be Rs.2,600/-. The Court had applied a\nmultiplier of 20 following the judgment of this Court in Joginder Kaur\nVersus State of Haryana through Secretary Transport-1991 ACJ 374.\nThe application of the multiplier in the light of the judgment of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma and others Versus Delhi\nTransport Corporation and another-2009 ACJ 1298, would have been\nto provide for a multiplier of 17. In this case, it is seen that the deceased\nwas a government servant and the Tribunal has not taken note of the\nfuture prospects of increase in salary. The Court is empowered to take\njudicial notice of the fact that in government service there are periodical\nincrements through Pay Commission recommendations and the failure of\nthe Tribunal to provide for future increments in salary with promotional\nprospects would, therefore, require to be remedied by taking the future\nincreases at 150% of the salary that he was drawing and if average were\nto be taken after making provision for such an increase, the monthly\nincome should be taken as Rs.6,000/-. If even 17 multiplier were to be\napplied to the amount and provide for all other statutory allowances, the\namount that would require to be paid would not fall short of\nRs.6,30,000/-, which was the amount awarded by the Tribunal and, under\nFAO No.1513 of 1992\n- 3 -\nthe circumstances, I do not find that there is no scope for modification of\nthe award. If, at all there, is only a scope for an increase. However, there\nis no representation on behalf of the respondents, I do not propose to\nundertake such an exercise. The award of the Tribunal is confirmed in\nall respects and the appeal is dismissed. \n (K.KANNAN)\nJUDGE\n.06.2010\nsanjeev"

He continued to serve in the State\nof Punjab prior to its re-organization and subsequently worked with the State of\nHimachal Pradesh with effect from 1.11.1966 till 14.8.1967 when he resigned\nfrom there.

On 2.6.1983 the\npetitioner retired on attaining the age of superannuation.\nIn the backdrop of the aforesaid facts, the petitioner has prayed for\ngrant of pensionary benefits which have been declined to him, and as a\njustification thereof, the respondents have stated in their reply that the petitioner\nwas brought on the regular rolls of the Department of P.W.D.(B&R), but the order\nof regularization could not be implemented because the petitioner failed to submit\nhimself for the medical examination which was the requirement. The date of\nregularization attributed to the petitioner is 28.8.1980 which is also evident from\nAnnexure R-1. \nThe solitary ground on which the prayer of the petitioner has been\ndeclined, has been noticed above i.e. the order of regularization not being\nimplemented on account of non-cooperation of the petitioner who failed to submit\nhimself for medical examination.\nI have considered the matter and am of the opinion that the petition\ndeserves to be accepted.

His services were regularized on 28.8.1980 and he\nretired from the Department in 1983 on attaining the age of superannuation.\nMerely because he did not get himself medically examined, would not rob him of\nthe benefit of regularization more particularly so, when he continued to serve the\nrespondents in the year 1983 i.e. 3 years after the date of regularization.

Advocate General, Punjab \nfor the respondents\n*****\nG. S. SANDHAWALIA, J.\n.\nThe present writ petition has been filed under Articles 226/227 \nof the Constitution of India for issuance of a writ in the nature of Certiorari \nquashing the charge sheet dated 29.10.1987(Annexure P-1) issued to the \npetitioner by the Government of Punjab, Department of Vigilance and show \ncause notice dated 30.1.1990 (Annexure P-2) whereby penalty of \ndismissal from service was proposed to be imposed upon him.\n.\nThe allegation levelled against the petitioner who was serving \nas a Junior Engineer was that during the period from 1.1.1981 to \n.3.1982, he had built a house at Rampura Phul on which he spent ` \n/- thereby he incurred expenditure disproportionate to his known \nsources and the enquiry was held by the Enquiry Officer, Vigilance \nDepartment, Punjab. The petitioner had objected to the jurisdiction of the \nEnquiry Officer-respondent no.2 to hold enquiry on the plea that he was a \nnon-gazetted officer. The charge sheet dated 29.10.1987 was served \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-2-\n****\nrelating to a matter for the period from 1.1.1981 to 31.3.1982, which was a \nstale one. \n.\nThat in the written statement, it has been pleaded that the \npetitioner had been given full opportunity to give his view point. The \nenquiry was with jurisdiction as it pertained to indulgence in corruption by \nthe petitioner by acquiring disproportionate assets to his known sources of \nincome and, therefore, issuance of show cause notice dated 30.1.1990 \nwas within the jurisdiction of respondent no.1. The enquiry was started \nagainst the petitioner on the basis of a complaint and a check period was \nfixed from 1.1.1981 to 31.3.1983 to calculate the income and expenditure \nand it took long time in the collection of documents from various quarters. \nThe enquiry was completed in the year 1987 and it was established that \nthe petitioner was guilty of acquiring disproportionate assets beyond his \nknown source of income. Thus, there was no delay in initiating action \nagainst the petitioner.\n.\nThe writ petition was admitted on 12.3.1990 and ordered to be \nheard along with Civil Writ Petition No.9432 of 1989 and directed that the \nstay would be in the same terms as in the aforesaid writ petition. The \noffice has put up the file of Civil Writ petition No.9432 of 1989 and from \nperusal of the same, it goes on to show that further proceedings before the \nInquiry Officer were stayed in that case and subsequently passing of final \norder was stayed. The said writ petition was allowed vide order dated \n.5.2009 and the following observations have been made:-\n It is almost 20 years that the disciplinary proceedings against \nthe petitioner have been stayed. The petitioner must have \nretired from service. No useful purpose will be served to allow \nthe disciplinary proceedings to be continued after lapse of \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-3-\n****\nsuch a long period. Otherwise also from the admitted facts on \nrecord, it appears that the incident relates back to the year \n-82, whereas charge sheet was issued after a period of 3 \nyears and even the enquiry was constituted against after a \nperiod of 3 years. There has been a serious lapse on the part \nof the respondents in promptly initiating disciplinary \nproceedings. It is not deemed appropriate to allow the \ndisciplinary proceedings after the lapse of such a long period.\nThis petition is accordingly allowed, charge sheet dated \n.5.1985 and enquiry proceedings against the petitioner are \nhereby quashed. \n.\nA perusal of the record shows that the petitioner was charge \nsheeted on 29.10.1987 on the ground that he had incurred excess \nexpenditure of ` 90,967/- which was beyond his known sources of income \nand that he had not taken prior permission of the Government for \nconstruction of the house. Eventually, the charge was only established to \nthe extent of spending of ` 13,378/- more than known sources of income \nin the years 1981 to 1983 and it was on the basis of the said report, the \nshow cause notice was issued on 30.1.1990 proposing penalty of \ndismissal from service, which is now subject matter of the writ petition. The \nrespondents in their reply also admitted that a complaint had been received \nand the enquiry had been started in April, 1983 against the petitioner but \nthe charge sheet was only issued on 29.10.1987. As per the respondents, \nthere was no delay in initiating action against the petitioner as it took a long \ntime for collection of documents from various quarters. The Hon'ble Apex \nCourt in State of M.P. Vs. Bani Singh and another 1990 (Sup) SCC 738 \nhad held that if there is no satisfactory explanation for the inordinate delay \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-4-\n****\nin issuing the charge sheet, it would be unfair for the department to \nproceed with the enquiry. The said view was followed in State of A.P. Vs. \nN. Radhakishan 1998 (4) SCC 154 and it was held as under:-\n It is not possible to lay down any pre-determined principles \napplicable to all cases and in all situations where there is delay \nin concluding the disciplinary proceedings. Whether on that \nground the disciplinary proceedings are to be terminated each \ncase has to be examined on the facts and circumstances in \nthat case. the essence of the matter is that the court has to \ntake into consideration all relevant factors and to balance and \nweigh them to determine if it is in the interest of clean and \nhonest administration that the disciplinary proceedings should \nbe allowed to terminate after delay particularly when delay is \nabnormal and there is no explanation for the delay. The \ndelinquent employee has a right that disciplinary proceedings \nagainst him are concluded expeditiously and he is not made to \nundergo mental agony and also monetary loss when these are \nunnecessarily prolonged without any fault on his part in \ndelaying the proceedings. In considering whether delay has \nvitiated the disciplinary proceedings the Court has to consider \nthe nature of charge, its complexity and on what account the \ndelay has occurred. if the delay is unexplained prejudice to the \ndelinquent employee is writ large on the face of it. It could also \nbe seen as to how much disciplinary authority is serious in \npursuing the charges against its employee. It is the basic \nprinciple of administrative justice that an officer entrusted with \na particular job has to perform his duties honestly, efficiently \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-5-\n****\nand in accordance with the rules. If he deviates from this path \nhe is to suffer a penalty prescribed. Normally, disciplinary \nproceedings should be allowed to take its course as per \nrelevant rules but then delay defeats justice. Delay causes \nprejudice to the charged officer unless it can be shown that he \nis to blame or when there is proper explanation for the delay in \nconducting the disciplinary proceedings. Ultimately, the court is \nto balance these two diverse considerations. \n.\nThereafter in P.V.Mahadevan Vs. M.D.Tamil Nadu Housing \nBoard 2005(6) SCC 636, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed as under:-\n Under the circumstances, we are of the opinion that allowing \nthe respondent to proceed further with the departmental \nproceedings at this distance of time will be very prejudicial to \nthe appellant. Keeping a higher government official under \ncharges of corruption and disputed integrity would cause \nunbearable mental agony and distress to the officer \nconcerned. The protracted disciplinary enquiry against a \ngovernment employee should, therefore, be avoided not only \nin the interests of the government employee but in public \ninterest and also in the interests of inspiring confidence in the \nminds of the government employees. At this stage, it is \nnecessary to draw the curtain and to put an end to the enquiry. \nThe appellant had already suffered enough and more on \naccount of the disciplinary proceedings. As a matter of fact, the \nmental agony and sufferings of the appellant due to the \nprotracted disciplinary proceedings would be much more than \nthe punishment. For the mistakes committed by the \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-6-\n****\ndepartment in the procedure for initiating the disciplinary \nproceedings, the appellant should not be made to suffer.\nWe, therefore, have no hesitation to quash the charge memo \nissued against the appellant. The appeal is allowed. The \nappellant will be entitled to all the retiral benefits in accordance \nwith law. The retiral benefit shall be disbursed within three \nmonths from this date. No costs.\n Appeal allowed  \n.\nKeeping in view the above principles laid down and after \nbalancing the facts in the present case and keeping in view the fact the \nrespondents have been unable to explain satisfactorily the delay in charge \nsheeting the petitioner even through they had received a complaint in 1983 \nand the said delay would necessarily have prejudiced the case of the \npetitioner to give a satisfactory explanation. In spite of the delay in \ninitiating the proceedings, it is apparent that the petitioner still successfully \nwas able to establish that he had not incurred excess expenditure of ` \n,967/- as alleged and the charge was only established to the extent of ` \n,378/-. Had the proceedings been initiated expeditiously, the prejudice \nwould have not been caused to the petitioner.\n.\nThat the disciplinary proceedings were stayed by a Division \nBench of this Court on 12.3.1990, which was 22 years ago and the said \norder has remained in force for the last two decades, this Court is thus of \nthe opinion that it would be appropriate to draw a curtain on the \ncontroversy and put an end to agony of the petitioner, who was appointed \nin the year 1961 and by now he must have retired from service. \nAccordingly, the present writ petition is allowed. Charge sheet dated \n.10.1987(Annexure P-1) and show cause notice dated 30.1.1990 \nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-7-\n****\n(Annexure P-2) whereby penalty of dismissal from service was proposed \nto be imposed upon the petitioner are quashed.\n(G.S.SANDHAWALIA)\n JUDGE\n.2.2013\nPka\nCivil Writ Petition No.2885 of 1990\n-8-\n****"

For facility\nof dictating judgment facts are being taken from CWP No. 12154 of 1991.\nIn this writ petition, challenge has been laid to a notification\nissued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, (in short the Act)\non March 11, 1977 proposing to acquire 3 Acres, 1 Kanal and 14 Marlas of\nland, for a public purpose, namely, construction of New Mandi Township at\nPathankot. Challenge has also been laid to a Notification issued under\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 12154 OF 1991\n-2-\nSection 6 of the Act on March 14, 1977. It is necessary to mention here that\nwhile issuing above said notifications, provisions of Section 17 of the Act\nwere also invoked. Challenge has also been laid to the Award passed on\nSeptember 23, 1986. \nIt is apparent from the records that the petitioners earlier also\nfiled a Civil Writ Petition No. 5726 of 1982 with a prayer to quash the\nnotifications issued under Sections 4 and 6. That writ petition was allowed\nin their favour vide order dated January 31, 1983 and the notifications in\nquestion were quashed. The respondent -State went to the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt and in Civil Appeal No. 2334 of 1986, vide order dated March 6,\n, judgment, passed by the High Court, was quashed and the acquisition\nwas upheld. Concluding portion of the judgment, passed by the Supreme\nCourt, reads thus:\n That the judgment and order dated 31st January, 1983 of the\nHigh Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Civil Writ\nPetition No. 5726 of 1982 be and is hereby set aside and in\nplace thereof an order dismissing the above mentioned Writ\nPetition filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court be and is\nhereby substituted;\n. That the parties herein shall bear their own costs of the said\nappeal in this Court.\n. That the order of this court dated 10th December, 1986 passed\nin the civil miscellaneous petition No. 14226 of 1983 in the\nsaid appeal directing the maintenance of status quo, be and is\nhereby vacated. Hence the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 12154 OF 1991\n-3-\nalready adjudicated the matter in view of the respondents.\nQuestion to release the land at this stage does not arise.  \nWhen the matter was pending before the Supreme Court, Award\nwas passed on September 23, 1986. The petitioners thereafter kept mum\nand filed this writ petition only in the year 1991 to lay challenge to the\nabove said notifications and the Award.\nIt is primary grievance of the petitioners that the Award was\npassed only with regard to land and nothing was provided therein so far as\nsuper-structures are concerned. Be that as it may, in view of the judgment\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mohanji and another v. State of U.P.\nAnd others, JT 1995 (8) S.C. 599, which was followed thereafter in the\ncase of State of Punjab and others v. Sharan Pal Singh and others, Civil\nAppeals Nos. 11850-53 of 1995, decided on December 14, 1995, impugned\nnotifications and the Award cannot be quashed. The petitioners, if\naggrieved for non-grant of compensation, for the superstructures could have\nfiled claim under Section 18 of the Act.\nFurther contention of counsel for the petitioners that by shifting\nthe proposed road to the adjoining area, the constructed house of the\npetitioners could have been saved is of no substance at this stage. This plea\nwas raised before the Supreme Court and was rejected while upholding the\nissuance of notifications. It is also contended by counsel for the petitioners\nthat on a representation made by them, the matter was reconsidered by the\ncompetent authority. A report was made by the O.S.D. , Revenue\nDepartment, on May 22, 2007, stating that the road could not be constructed\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 12154 OF 1991\n-4-\nat the spot on account of resistance caused by the petitioners and further that\nthe proposed alternative road, may be more suitable. At this stage, it is not\npossible for us to interfere in the acquisition, which had become final in the\nyear 1987. The area could not be used for the purpose for which it was\nacquired because firstly the acquisition proceedings were quashed by this\nCourt and thereafter the Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the acquisition in\nthe year 1987. The construction raised was in existence when the\nacquisition was upheld. It is not case of the petitioners that in the\nintervening period, they have raised the construction. The road could not be\nconstructed because of resistance shown by the petitioners. No case is made\nout for interference. This writ petition is dismissed.\nCWP No. 8898 of 1991:\nSo far as CWP No. 8898 of 1991 is concerned, in this case it is\nprimary grievance of the petitioners that Award and the Notifications, vide\nwhich the land was acquired, be quashed because no compensation was\nawarded for the super-structures when award was passed on April 11, 1991.\nFor the reasons given in the earlier part of this judgment, no\ncase is made out for interference in this case also. Dismissed.\nCWP No. 8811 of 1996:\nBy filing CWP No. 8811 of 1996, notification issued under\nSection 4 of the Act on June 7, 1993, and further notification issued under\nSection 6 of the Act on January 3, 1994, are under challenge. Further\nchallenge has been laid to an award passed on February 14, 1996. This\npetition was filed in the month of June, 1996. In view of ratio of the\njudgment in Star Wire(India) Ltd. v. State of Haryana, (1996) 11 SCC\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 12154 OF 1991\n-5-\n, this writ petition having been filed after passing of an award cannot be\nentertained. Furthermore, by the time this writ petition was filed, most of\nthe area was utilised for the purpose for which it was acquired. Dismissed.\n\n( JASBIR SINGH )\nJUDGE\n(AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH)\nJUDGE\nDecember 03 , 2010. \nDKC"

      "a half years. Their services having been terminated suddenly without any notice or enquiry, whatsoever, they appear to have raised an industrial dispute Letters Patent Appeal No. 612 of 1992 culminating in a reference to the Labour Court for determination of the following common question:- Whether termination of services of Sh. Amarjeet Singh (name of the workman in each case is different) is justified and in order? If not, to what relief/extent amount of compensation is he entitled? On receipt of the reference, the Labour Court framed two issues for determination, namely:- ) Whether the reference is bad in law as per preliminary objections of the written statement? ) Whether the order of termination of services of the workman is justified and in order? The parties were permitted to adduce evidence in support of their respective cases, upon appreciation whereof, the Labour Court eventually came to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong with the reference made by the Government and that the termination of services of the workmen, being without any charge sheet and any enquiry, whatsoever, against them, was clearly illegal. The Court also held that the case of the Municipal Committee that the workmen had themselves abandoned their appointments and left, was totally unconvincing. The Labour Court, accordingly, set aside the termination and directed reinstatement of all the workmen/respondents with continuity of service. Since the Committee had failed to produce any cogent evidence to prove that the workmen had remained gainfully employed during the Letters Patent Appeal No. 612 of 1992 period of their forced idleness, the Labour Court also declared the workmen entitled to their reinstatement with continuity of service and full back wages. Aggrieved by the order passed by the Labour Court, the Municipal Committee filed Civil Writ Petition Nos. 7570 to 7575, 8249, to 8253 and 9105 of 1991 in this Court which were heard and eventually disposed of by N.C. Jain, J., as his Lordship then was, by similar but separate orders, all dated 26.3.1992, as noticed earlier. The learned Single Judge was of the view that the issues raised by the Committee, in the writ petitions, involved disputed questions of facts, which the Court was not inclined to examine. It was further observed that the workmen had consented to the disposal of the writ petitions with a direction to the Committee to pay 30% of the actual wages, due to them for the period they remained out of job and to reinstate the workmen with continuity of service. Learned Single Judge observed:- XXX XXX XXX XX Since disputed questions of facts are involved, this Court is disinclined to go into the same. When the case was in progress during the arguments on certain dates of hearing, the workmen were agreeable to have 50 per cent of the back wages. Today at the very outset, the counsel for the workmen after taking instructions from them who are present in Court, has consented that his clients are willing to have back wages to the extent of 30 per cent of the actual wages which are due to them Letters Patent Appeal No. 612 of 1992 provided they are ordered to be reinstated forthwith with the benefits of continuity of service. It has further been submitted by the counsel for the workmen that his clients may also be considered for regularization of their services favourably and if this is ordered, the workmen would be satisfied with only per cent of the back wages as per the wages under the law . The present appeals question the correctness of the above judgment and order, as noticed above. When these appeals came up before us on 4.8.2009, Mr. Arun Palli, learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents, pointed out that the respondents, except Ram Pal who had passed away during the pendency of writ petition, had been regularized in service as Beldars, by the appellant-Committee. Mr. Ghuman appearing for the appellant-Municipal Committee, Patiala, which has in due course become a Corporation, sought time to verify the true position and make his submissions. Mr. Ghuman submits, today, on instructions, that all the respondents, except deceased Ram Pal, have been regularized in service as Beldars pursuant to a policy formulated by the Government in that connection. He further stated that so far as payment of back wages is concerned, while the payment of % of back wages to all other respondents remains to be made, the amount payable to Jagiro widow of Ram Pal has already been released in her favour. He urged that this Court could, notwithstanding the said subsequent developments and regularization of services of the Letters Patent Appeal No. 612 of 1992 respondents, examine whether the order passed by the Labour Court and upheld by learned Single Judge was legally valid in the eyes of law. He contended that the very fact that the respondents have been regularized in service does not make any material difference, especially when the respondents had not been appointed on the basis of any valid process of recruitment at the time of their initial appointment, and that regularization of employees who had joined the service without going through a proper selection process, has not been favoured by the Hon'ble Apex Court. On behalf of the respondents, Mr. Palli, on the other hand, contended that the issue regarding regularization of services of the respondents does not strictly speaking, arise for consideration in these proceedings as the appellant-Corporation had, on its own, regularized their services upon the respondents fulfilling the conditions stipulated for such regularization in terms of the policy formulated by the Government. He further argued that once the regularization had been ordered by the Corporation, it was no longer open to it to find fault with the method of recruitment adopted by the Municipality or grudge the regularization which was due to the respondents on the Municipal Corporation's own showing. In so far as payment of back wages is concerned, Mr. Palli pointed out that the respondents had agreed to forego 70% of their back wages only because the Court was issuing a direction for their regularization. At any rate, the amount of back wages, according to Mr. Palli, was less than a sum of Rs.6,000/- per employee, having regard to the fact that the respondents were receiving Rs.540/- to Rs.600/- per Letters Patent Appeal No. 612 of 1992 month only and the period for which such wages were payable was limited to only 32 months between the date of their termination and the date of their reinstatement. He submitted that at any rate the entire claim towards back wages for the period from the date of termination till the date of reinstatement could be limited to Rs.5,000/- in each one of these cases in full and final settlement of the claim of the respondents in that connection to avoid any confusion or controversy arising between the parties as to the quantification of the liability in future. There is, in our opinion, considerable merit in the submissions made by Mr. Palli. The termination of the services of the respondents has been found by the Labour Court to be wholly unjustified as the same was neither preceded by any charge sheet or enquiry against any one of them nor any allegation of misconduct was ever made against the said respondents. The version given by the Corporation that the respondents had, on their own, abandoned their jobs was also rightly disbelieved by the Labour Court. In the circumstances, there was nothing wrong with the direction issued by the Labour Court that termination of services of the respondents was legally bad. So also the consequential direction that the Committee shall reinstate the respondents with back wages could not be found fault with having regard to the fact that the termination itself was found to be illegal and there was nothing on record to show that the respondents had been gainfully employed during the period they were forced out of employment. Be that as it may, the respondents had, in the writ petition, consented to the order passed by the Labour Court being modified to the extent that instead of full back wages they would be satisfied in case Letters Patent Appeal No. 612 of 1992 back wages to the extent of 30% were awarded in their favour and their services regularized. The learned Single Judge accepted that submission and accordingly disposed of the writ petitions holding that the Corporation would reinstate the respondents with continuity of service and 30% back wages to them. The order regarding payment of back wages was, however, stayed by this Court in the present appeals and regularization, if any granted, directed to remain subject to the ultimate outcome of these proceedings. It is in that background that the respondents appear to have been considered for regularization in accordance with the scheme which the Government has formulated and found eligible for the same as early as in the year 2001 onwards. Nine years after the said regularization, it is neither open to the appellant- Corporation nor otherwise fair to put a question mark on the said regularization. The respondents have served as regular employees of the Corporation all these years. Even otherwise, the award made by the Labour Court is of the year 1990 i.e. nearly two decades old. We, therefore, have no hesitation in holding that the question of regularization of the respondents on the basis of the award made by the Labour court is no longer open to any debate or discussion, the same having been settled by the Municipality on its own in accordance with the scheme formulated in that regard. The only question that remains to be considered is whether we ought to interfere with the direction issued by learned Single Judge to the extent he has awarded back wages to the respondents at the rate of 30% of such wages. The said direction, as noticed earlier, had proceeded on the consent of the respondents given during the course of Letters Patent Appeal No. 612 of 1992 arguments before learned Single Judge. But for the said consent the respondents may have been able to support the directions of full back wages also. At any rate, we need not go into the question whether the respondents are entitled to anything more than 30% back wages as Mr. Palli has reiterated his submissions made before learned Single Judge that the respondents are satisfied with 30% back wages only. In fairness to Mr. Palli, we must also record that he was agreeable to this Court putting at rest the controversy as to the amount actually payable to the respondents by quantifying the same at Rs.5,000/- in each one of the cases. Such being the position and keeping in view the fact that the amount is not so fabulous so as to make it difficult for the Corporation to pay the same, we see no compelling reason for us to interfere with the direction issued by learned Single Judge. We, accordingly, dismiss these appeals with the direction that the arrears of Rs.5,000/- payable to each one of the respondents except to the widow of Ram Pal who has already been paid, shall be released in favour of the said respondents, expeditiously, but not later than six months from the date of this order, failing which the said amount shall start earning interest at the rate of % per annum from the date the period of six months expires till the date of actual payment. No costs. (T.S.Thakur) Chief Justice (Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia) Judge August 10, 2009 DK"

He submitted that at any rate the entire claim\ntowards back wages for the period from the date of termination till the\ndate of reinstatement could be limited to Rs.5,000/- in each one of these\ncases in full and final settlement of the claim of the respondents in that\nconnection to avoid any confusion or controversy arising between the\nparties as to the quantification of the liability in future.\nThere is, in our opinion, considerable merit in the submissions\nmade by Mr. Palli. The termination of the services of the respondents\nhas been found by the Labour Court to be wholly unjustified as the same\nwas neither preceded by any charge sheet or enquiry against any one\nof them nor any allegation of misconduct was ever made against the\nsaid respondents. The version given by the Corporation that the\nrespondents had, on their own, abandoned their jobs was also rightly\ndisbelieved by the Labour Court. In the circumstances, there was\nnothing wrong with the direction issued by the Labour Court that\ntermination of services of the respondents was legally bad. So also the\nconsequential direction that the Committee shall reinstate the\nrespondents with back wages could not be found fault with having\nregard to the fact that the termination itself was found to be illegal and\nthere was nothing on record to show that the respondents had been\ngainfully employed during the period they were forced out of\nemployment. Be that as it may, the respondents had, in the writ petition,\nconsented to the order passed by the Labour Court being modified to\nthe extent that instead of full back wages they would be satisfied in case\nLetters Patent Appeal No. 612 of 1992 \nback wages to the extent of 30% were awarded in their favour and their\nservices regularized. The learned Single Judge accepted that\nsubmission and accordingly disposed of the writ petitions holding that\nthe Corporation would reinstate the respondents with continuity of\nservice and 30% back wages to them. The order regarding payment of\nback wages was, however, stayed by this Court in the present appeals\nand regularization, if any granted, directed to remain subject to the\nultimate outcome of these proceedings. It is in that background that the\nrespondents appear to have been considered for regularization in\naccordance with the scheme which the Government has formulated and\nfound eligible for the same as early as in the year 2001 onwards. Nine\nyears after the said regularization, it is neither open to the appellant-\nCorporation nor otherwise fair to put a question mark on the said\nregularization. The respondents have served as regular employees of\nthe Corporation all these years. Even otherwise, the award made by the\nLabour Court is of the year 1990 i.e. nearly two decades old. We,\ntherefore, have no hesitation in holding that the question of\nregularization of the respondents on the basis of the award made by the\nLabour court is no longer open to any debate or discussion, the same\nhaving been settled by the Municipality on its own in accordance with\nthe scheme formulated in that regard. \n\nThe only question that remains to be considered is whether\nwe ought to interfere with the direction issued by learned Single Judge\nto the extent he has awarded back wages to the respondents at the rate\nof 30% of such wages. The said direction, as noticed earlier, had\nproceeded on the consent of the respondents given during the course of\nLetters Patent Appeal No. 612 of 1992 \narguments before learned Single Judge. But for the said consent the\nrespondents may have been able to support the directions of full back\nwages also. At any rate, we need not go into the question whether the\nrespondents are entitled to anything more than 30% back wages as Mr.\nPalli has reiterated his submissions made before learned Single Judge\nthat the respondents are satisfied with 30% back wages only. In fairness\nto Mr. Palli, we must also record that he was agreeable to this Court\nputting at rest the controversy as to the amount actually payable to the\nrespondents by quantifying the same at Rs.5,000/- in each one of the\ncases. Such being the position and keeping in view the fact that the\namount is not so fabulous so as to make it difficult for the Corporation to\npay the same, we see no compelling reason for us to interfere with the\ndirection issued by learned Single Judge. We, accordingly, dismiss\nthese appeals with the direction that the arrears of Rs.5,000/- payable to\neach one of the respondents except to the widow of Ram Pal who has\nalready been paid, shall be released in favour of the said respondents,\nexpeditiously, but not later than six months from the date of this order,\nfailing which the said amount shall start earning interest at the rate of\n% per annum from the date the period of six months expires till the\ndate of actual payment. No costs.\n(T.S.Thakur)\nChief Justice\n(Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\n Judge\nAugust 10, 2009\n\n DK"

State of Haryana).\nVide notification dated 7.1.1988 published in Haryana\nGovernment Gazette, issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act,\n( for short `the Act'), Government of Haryana, notified the land in\ndispute measuring 2 kanal 11 marlas situated in village Bijjarpur Tangori ,\nTehsil Thanesar, District Kurukshetra, with intention to acquire the same for\na public purpose,namely, for allotment of residential plots to landless/\nhomeless members of backward classes and economically weaker section of\nthe village. Notification dated 25.4.1988 was published under section 6 of\nthe Act, declaring that the land measuring 2 kanal 11 marlas was acquired\nRFA No.1695 of 1990\nfor the public purpose mentioned above. The landowners were given an\nopportunity to file objections. After hearing the objections Award No.6\ndated 30.6.1988 was pronounced by the Land Acquisition Collector fixing\ncompensation at the rate of Rs.20,000/- per acre for Chahi land, Rs.15000/-\nper acre for Barani land, Rs.12,000/- per acre for Banjar Jadeed, Rs.8000/-\nper acre for Banjar Kadeem land and Rs.6000/- per acre for gair mumkin..\nIt is not in dispute that the land in dispute is Chahi in nature. The\nlandowners/appellants were also awarded solatium at the rate of 30% along\nwith variation charges at the rate of 15% of the compensation amount.\nHowever, no interest was awarded as possession was not taken till the date\nof the award, was announced.\nAggrieved against the aforesaid award of the Collector,\nlandowners filed reference under Section 18 of the Act, contending that the\nmarket value determined by the Land Acquisition Collector was inadequate\nand he has failed to take into consideration the prevailing market value of\nthe land in question. Application was contested by the State of Haryana\nsubmitting that the compensation awarded by the Collector was quite\nadequate and market value was fixed taking taking into consideration\nrelevant factors for the said purpose.\nOn the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were\nframed:-\n. What was the market value of the acquired land at the time\nof issue of notification under section 4(1) of the Land\nAcquisition Act ?OPP\n. Relief.\nAfter considering the evidence on record, vide the impugned\nRFA No.1695 of 1990\naward the Reference Court fixed market value of the land at the rate of\nRs.40,000/- per acre for Chahi land. The claimants were also held entitled\nto all the statutory benefits as per the Amendment Act of 1984. However,\nthe variation charges at the rate of 15% awarded by the Collector were\nordered to be deleted, as the same were not permissible in law.\nStill feeling dissatisfied, the appellant has approached this\nCourt by way of the instant appeal, for further enhancement of the\ncompensation awarded to him.\nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the\nrecord of the case with their help.\n It is not in dispute that the acquired land was agricultural in\nnature at the time of acquisition. It has also been established on record that\nthe same was near to the village abadi. It may also be relevant to mention\nthat the sale instances produced on record by the State depict that the\naverage sale price of the land was Rs.15233/- and Rs.19254/-. It may also be\nnoticed that there is nothing on file to prove that the lands of these two sale\ninstances was also situated in the same locality. On the other hand sale deed\nEx.P1 dated 2.7.1987 vide which 4 marlas of land was sold for Rs.3000/-\ndenotes the average sale price of Rs.1,20,000/- and it has also come on\nrecord that the land under the said sale instances is similarly situated as the\nacquired land. However, it is well settled that even the sale instances\npertaining to small piece of land can be considered while determining the\nvalue of a big chunk of land after applying a suitable cut. Keeping in view\nthe fact that land was measuring 4 marlas was sold vide sale stance Ex.P1\nand that the total land acquired in question is 2 Kanal 11 marlas, this Court\nfeels that a cut off 25% on the said sale price be applied in the instant case.\nRFA No.1695 of 1990\nThus, after applying the said cut, the rate of the land comes to Rs.90,000/-\nper acre. It may also be noticed that the said sale instance is dated 2.7.1987\nwhereas the acquisition has taken place after about six months i.e. 7.1.1988.\nThus, the appellant is also entitled to a suitable increase in the market value\nof the land keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case. This\nCourt is of the view that the market value of the land in question should\nhave been determined at Rs.100,000/- per acre.\nIn view of the above, RFA No.1695 of 1990 filed by the\nclaimants is allowed and RFA No.1876 of 1990 filed by the State of\nHaryana is dismissed. The market value of the land in question is\ndetermined at the rate of Rs.1,00,000/-per acre. The appellant is also entitled\nto all the statutory benefits as permissible.\n(Rakesh Kumar Garg)\n Judge\nJuly 5, 2011\nrk\nRFA No.1695 of 1990\nIN THE HIGH COURTOF PUNJAB AND HARYANA, CHANDIGARH.\n RFA No.1876 of 1990\n Date of decision: 5.7.2011\nState of Haryana\n...Appellant\n vs\nJeeva Singh\n\n....Respondent\nCORAM:\nHON'BLE MR.JUSTICE RAKESH KUMAR GARG.\n---\nPresent:\nMr.Ashish Gupta, AAG Haryana, for the State.\nNone for the respondent.\n--\n Rakesh Kumar Garg,J.(oral).\nFor orders, see RFA No. 1695 of 1990.\n(Rakesh Kumar Garg)\n Judge\nJuly 5, 2011\nrk"

The property is stated to be\nowned by respondent No. 2. At the time of assessment of house tax, a\nnotice was issued to him by Executive Officer, Muncipal Committee,\nSangrur.

But after hearing the parties, Sub-Divisional\nOfficer (Civil) observed that no portion of house was let-out. He, thus,\nset-aside the assessment order in so far it pertained to portion purportedly\nlet out and reduced the assessment in respect of self occupied portion from\nRs. 3,000/- to Rs. 28,00/-. Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued\nthat the order passed by the appellate authority is unsustainable. According\nto him, the authority could not have exempted the rented portion from\nassessment of house tax. He has also assailed the finding of appellate court\nto the effect that house was not rented out. Learned counsel, therefore,\nprays that matter may be remanded back to the same authority for decision\nafresh. \nNo reply has been filed on behalf of the respondents. The\nprayer for remand is, however, not opposed by learned State counsel. \nI have heard counsel for the parties and given careful thought to\nthe facts of the case. \nFrom the order passed by appellate authority, it is not clear\nwhether the assessment order was passed in respect of entire residential\nproperty in question or part thereof, nor is it specified how a finding of fact\nwas arrived at by the appellate authority that the house was not rented out. \nUnder the circumstances, this court accepts the prayer made by\ncounsel for the parties that the matter be remanded back to the same\nauthority for decision afresh. Resultantly, impugned order dated 24.07.1987,\nAnnexure P-2 passed by appellate authority is hereby set-aside. The matter\nis remitted back to the same authority for taking a fresh decision after\nCivil Writ Petition No. 2028 of 1998\nhearing the parties. The parties are directed to remain present before the\nappellate authority on 05.03.2010.\nWith the above said observations, the writ petition is allowed. \nJanuary 27, 2010\n(RAJAN GUPTA)\nAjay\n JUDGE"

Haryana.\nShri Atul Lakhanpal, Senior Advocate with Shri Arjun Lakhanpal,\nAdvocate.\nMAHESH GROVER, J. \nThe petitioner impugns the order of his retrenchment. He was\nworking as a Technical Supervisor with respondent No.2. i.e. the Haryana State\nSmall Industries & Export Corporation Ltd. when he along with other similarly\nsituated persons faced retrenchment. The rentrechment was necessitated on\naccount of the closure of the Corporation which fact is controverted by the counsel\nfor the respondents who contends that only one unit was closed. This plea of the\npetitioner has been vehemently controverted by the respondents who has asserted\nthat the entire Corporation had since been closed and its operations wound up.\nC.W.P. No.732 of 1992 -2-\nThere is no such material on record from where it can be inferred that the\nCorporation has been wound up. But the counsel for the petitioner certainly\nadmits that one unit of the Corporation has been closed. There is no order to this\neffect also on record. So even if the statement of the counsel for the petitioner is\naccepted to be correct, then also there is nothing on record to show that a\nrehabilitation policy was formulated by the respondents to adjust the retrenched\nemployees. It was incumbent for the petitioner to place on record such a policy in\nthe event of seeking such a benefit therefrom.\nIn the absence of any such material, this Court has been precluded\nfrom evaluating as to whether the petitioner was entitled to rehabilitation more\nparticularly when it has been shown by the respondents that the Corporation or a\npart thereof employing the petitioner is no longer in existence. Apart from that,\neven if the best case of the petitioner is accepted, he would have been entitled to\nadjustment as per the policy, if any and this would have made him entitled to a\nbenefit which today can be termed to be illusory, as he would not have got any\nmonetary benefits from the respondents on account of such an adjustment on the\nprinciple of 'no pay for no work'.\nFor all intents and purposes, the instant petition has been rendered\ninfructuous as the petitioner who preferred the petition, has expired and the writ\npetition is being prosecuted by his legal representatives.\nFor the aforesaid reasons, the writ petition is dismissed as having\nbecome infructuous.\n(MAHESH GROVER)\nJuly 23, 2013\n\nJUDGE\nGD\n\nWHETHER TO BE REFERRED TO REPORTER?

(Oral):\nHeard the learned counsel for the parties at length.\nThe facts are taken from CWP No.3223 of 1988.\nThese petitions have been filed challenging the order\npassed by the Director, Higher Education, Haryana, Chandigarh,\nCWP No.3223 of 1988 2\nwithdrawing the interim benefit earlier granted to the petitioners and\nconsequential recovery. It appears that the petitioners working in\nvarious schools were granted benefit of interim relief with effect from\n.12..1985 on the pattern of the University Grants Commission\nGrades. The first instalment was released and thereafter on\nconsideration of the matter, the impugned order dated 12.5.1987,\nAnnexure P-3 (in CWP No.3223 of 1988) has been passed withdrawing\nthe benefit/relief and the excess amount is sought to be recovered.\nIn the reply filed by the respondents it is stated that on the\nbasis of the letters dated 2.8.1983 and 29..4.1985 issued from the\nGovernment of India, on the recommendation of 4th Pay Commission,\nthe Government of Haryana sanctioned two instalments of interim\nrelief. After disbursement of the first instalment and at the time of the\ndisbursement of the second instalment, it came to the notice of the\nauthorities that the payment has been made in violation of the\ninstructions Annexure P-2. On that basis, impugned order came to be\npassed.\nMr.RK Malik, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\npetitioners submits that he has instructions to say that the petitioners do\nnot dispute the refixation of their pay or withdrawal of the benefit, but\nconfine relief only to the recovery part. \nFrom the reply, it appears \n neither fraud nor\nmisrepresentation is attributed to the petitioners. It was only on the\nbasis of the interpretation of the government instructions that the\nCWP No.3223 of 1988 3\namount was paid to the petitioners. The issue involved in the present\nwrit petitions is squarely covered by a Full Bench judgment of this\nCourt in the case of Budh Ram and others Vs. State of Haryana and\nothers (CWP No.2799 of 2009) decided on 22.5.2009 wherein the\nfollowing observations have been made:-\n We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that\nin case the employees who are recipient of the\nbenefits extended to them on an erroneous\ninterpretation or application of any rule, regulation,\ncircular and instructions have not been any way\ncontributed to such erroneous interpretation or\nhave they committed any fraud, misrepresentation,\ndeception to obtain the grant of such benefit, the\nbenefit so extended may be stopped for the future,\nbut the amount already paid to the employees\ncannot be recovered from them. \nIn view of the above, the present writ petitions are partly\nallowed while upholding the refixation/withdrawal of the relief, the\nrecovery against the petitioners is hereby quashed. If any recovery pursuant\nto the impugned orders is made from the petitioners, the same shall be\nrefunded to them within a period of four months. No costs.\nA copy of this order be placed on the record of each connected\nfile.\n.01.2010\n(PERMOD KOHLI)\nBLS\nJUDGE\nCWP No.3223 of 1988 4"

      "acquired land is about 3 feet in the site plan. Calculated in this manner, the distance would come to about 4.2 kilometers. Moreover, the acquired land of judgment Ex. A-4 was situated within municipal limits of Kot Kapura. Acquired land in the instant cases is situated in Village Dhilwan Kalan. Abadi of Dhilwan Kalan intervenes the acquired land and Grain Market of Kot Kapura. The acquired land is one kilometer away on the other side from abadi of Village Dhilwan Kalan. In this view of the matter, judgment Ex.A-4 has no relevance in determining the market value of acquired land in the instant case. Even a small distance within municipal limits may result in vast difference in market value of land. Moreover, the acquired land involved in judgment Ex.A-4 was found suitable for residential and commercial purposes, in view of location thereof. The acquired land of that case was on the junction of two roads i.e. R. F. A. No. 811 of 1991 Kot Kapura Bathinda Road and Kot Kapura Moga Road and there was also 3 karams vide kacha passage on third side of the said land. There were shops on both sides of Kot Kapura Bathinda Road as well as Kot Kapura Moga Road, besides FCI godown, petrol pump and bus stand near the said land. There was also a cinema hall on the Bathinda Road besides large number of buildings adjoining the acquired land. There were also shops in the acquired land of that case. Consequently, there is no comparison of the acquired land of that case with acquired land of the instant case. Sale deed Ex.A-5 has also rightly been discarded by the Reference Court because the said sale deed pertains to a small residential plot in the abadi, whereas the acquired land is a big chunk of agricultural land situated about one kilometer away from abadi. Moreover, sale deed Ex.A-5 was executed about 1 years after notification under Section 4 of the Act and the same could have been manipulated to claim enhanced compensation. In any event, the said sale deed is not comparable sale instance as it relates to a plot of abadi area. Sale instances Ex.R-2 to Ex.R-4 produced by the respondents are somewhat comparable sale instances because the same relate to sale of agricultural land just 6-7 months prior to the date of notification under Section 4 of the Act. Land of these sale deeds has been depicted in site plan Ex. R-1 and the same is just near the acquired land. Land of sale deed Ex.R-2 even abuts the National Highway. According to the sale deeds Ex.R-2 to Ex.R-4, the market value of the land was Rs.23,000/- to Rs.24,000/- per acre only. However, these sale instances were ignored by the Reference Court because even the Land Acquisition Collector has awarded compensation at higher rate. Learned counsel for the appellants next emphatically contended that the acquired land was located on National Highway and therefore, had potential value. Learned counsel for the appellants relying on four R. F. A. No. 811 of 1991 judgments of this Court in the cases of Surat Singh vs. State of Haryana reported as 2000 (1) R.C.R. (Civil) 349, Bhulla Ram alias Bhola, Bhola Ram vs. State of Haryana reported as 1996 (1) R.R.R. 761, Binkal Kumar vs. State of Haryana and another reported as 1991 (1) R.R.R. and Smt. Bindu Garg vs. State of Haryana reported as 1999 (2) R.C.R. (Civil) 261 contended that in view of location of the acquired land on National Highway, the land owners are entitled to enhanced compensation. The contention cannot be accepted because learned Additional District Judge, after taking into consideration the location of the acquired land on the National Highway, has enhanced the market value by Rs.7,000/- per acre for the acquired land, notwithstanding that no evidence of any comparable sale instances was adduced by the land owners. The compensation awarded by the Reference Court cannot be said to be less than the market value of the acquired land on the date of notification under Section 4 of the Act, in any manner. The Reference Court has already taken a favourable view for the land owners. In view of the aforesaid, I find no merit in these appeals, which are accordingly dismissed. May 26, 2009 ( L. N.

No. 811 of 1991\nDate of Decision : May 26, 2009\n\nGurbachan Singh and others \n....\n Appellants\nVs.\n\n State of Punjab and another\n....\nRespondents\nCORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE L. N.

(Oral) :\nBy this common judgment, I am disposing of four appeals i.e.\nR. F. A. Nos. 811 of 1991, 812 of 1991, 813 of 1991 and 1686 of 1991 as\nall these four appeals have been preferred by land owners for enhancement\nof compensation, as awarded by learned Additional District Judge, Faridkot,\nvide impugned Award dated 01.12.1990, whereby petitions filed by the\nappellants and many other land owners under Section 18 of the Land\nAcquisition Act, 1894 (in short   the Act) were disposed of. \nState Government, vide notification dated 10.01.1986 issued\nunder Section 4 of the Act, notified land measuring 62 kanals 05 marlas\nsituated in the revenue estate of Village Dhilwan Kalan for acquisition for\n R. F. A. No. 811 of 1991 \npublic purpose namely for straightening of portion of National Highway\nNo. 15. Land Acquisition Collector, vide Award No. 1 dated 18.06.1986,\ndetermined market value of the acquired land @ Rs.30,000/- per acre for\nnehri land measuring 60 kanals 01 marla and @ Rs.20,000/- per acre for\nthe remaining gair mumkin chhappar (01 kanal   06 marlas) and gair\nmumkin rasta (18 marlas). The land owners were not satisfied with the\ncompensation awarded by the Land Acquisition Collector and therefore,\nfiled petitions under Section 18 of the Act claiming compensation at\nenhanced rate alleging that market value of the acquired land was\nRs.1,00,000/- per acre. It may be noticed that before the Land Acquisition\nCollector, the land owners claimed the market value of the acquired land to\nbe Rs.45,000/- per acre only for nehri land.\nThe respondents controverted the stand of the land owners by\nfiling written statement and pleaded that the Land Acquisition Collector has\nawarded compensation as per market value.\nFollowing common issued were framed in the cases :-\n 1.\nWhether the compensation paid is inadequate ? If\nso, what compensation should have been paid ?\nOPA\n.\nWhether the application is not maintainable in the\npresent form ? OPR\n.\nRelief.  \nLearned Additional District Judge, Faridkot vide impugned\nAward dated 01.12.1990, determined the market value of the acquired land\nto be Rs.37,000/- per acre for nehri land and Rs.27,000/- per acre for the\nremaining land under issue no.1. Issue no.2 was decided against the\nrespondents as neither pressed nor proved. The reference petitions were\naccordingly disposed of by awarding compensation for the acquired land at\nthe aforesaid rates. \n R. F. A. No. 811 of 1991 \nFeeling dissatisfied, the land owners have filed the instant\nappeals. \nI have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the\ncase files.\nSanta Singh land owner (AW-1) and Sodagar Singh land\nowner (AW-2) have stated about location of the acquired land. They also\nstated that its market value was Rs.1,00,000/- per acre at the time of\nacquisition. Dhanna Singh   retired SDO (AW-3) proved site plan (Ex.A-1)\nregarding location of the acquired land. He also proved aks masavi (Ex.A-\n) besides his report (Ex.A-3). The land owners also tendered in evidence\njudgment dated 09.04.1990 (Ex.A-4) passed by this Court in R. F. A. No.\nof 1988 titled Jai Kaur vs. State of Punjab and another, whereby\nbunch of appeals relating to land acquired for establishment of new mandi\nat Kot Kapura were disposed of, determining the market value to be Rs.37/-\nper square yard. The land owners also produced copy of sale deed dated\n.06.1987 (Ex.A-5) relating to a plot measuring 01 kanal   5-1/3 marlas\nsituated in abadi of Village Dhilwan Kalan for Rs.25,333/- i.e. at the rate of\nRs.1,60,000/- per acre.\nOn the other hand, respondents produced copies of three sale\ndeeds Ex.R-2 to Ex.R-4. Sale deeds Ex.R-2 and Ex.R-3 are both dated\n.06.1985 regarding sale of 16 kanals land each for Rs.46,000/- i.e. @\nRs.23,000/- per acre. Sale deed Ex.R-4 dated 24.07.1985 is regarding sale\nof 03 kanals land for Rs.9,000/- i.e. @ Rs.24,000/- per acre.\nLearned Additional District Judge found judgment Ex.A-4 of\nthis Court to be not of comparable land and also found sale instance Ex.A-5\nproduced by the land owners to be not a comparable sale instance.\nSimilarly, sale instances vide sale deeds Ex.R-2 to Ex.R-4 produced by the\nrespondents were also found to be not comparable sale instances because\neven the Land Acquisition Collector has awarded compensation at a higher\n R. F. A. No. 811 of 1991 \nrate than depicted by these sale instances. However, learned Additional\nDistrict Judge, taking into consideration the location of the acquired land\nalong the National Highway and taking into consideration other\ncircumstances, enhanced the market value of the acquired land by\nRs.7,000/- per acre.\nLearned counsel for the appellants vehemently contended that\njudgment Ex.A-4 of this Court pertains to land in Kot Kapura, which is at a\ndistance of about 3 kilometers only from the acquired land and therefore\njudgment Ex.A-4 should be taken into consideration for determining the\nmarket value of the acquired land. The contention cannot be accepted.\nSanta Singh (AW-1) stated that the acquired land is 2  to 3 kilometers from\nthe Grain Market, Kot Kapura, to which judgment Ex. A-4 relates. Sodagar\nSingh (AW-2) stated the said distance to be 2 kilometers. Dhanna Singh\n(AW-3) stated the said distance to be 3 kilometers. However, learned\nAdditional District Judge has observed that in scaled site plan Ex. A-1,\nprepared by Dhanna Singh (AW-3), scale used is 1 inch = 100 meters and\nthe distance between Grain Market and acquired land is about 3  feet in the\nsite plan. Calculated in this manner, the distance would come to about 4.2\nkilometers. Moreover, the acquired land of judgment Ex. A-4 was situated\nwithin municipal limits of Kot Kapura. Acquired land in the instant cases is\nsituated in Village Dhilwan Kalan. Abadi of Dhilwan Kalan intervenes the\nacquired land and Grain Market of Kot Kapura. The acquired land is one\nkilometer away on the other side from abadi of Village Dhilwan Kalan. In\nthis view of the matter, judgment Ex.A-4 has no relevance in determining\nthe market value of acquired land in the instant case. Even a small distance\nwithin municipal limits may result in vast difference in market value of\nland. Moreover, the acquired land involved in judgment Ex.A-4 was found\nsuitable for residential and commercial purposes, in view of location\nthereof. The acquired land of that case was on the junction of two roads i.e.\n R. F. A. No. 811 of 1991 \nKot Kapura   Bathinda Road and Kot Kapura   Moga Road and there was\nalso 3 karams vide kacha passage on third side of the said land. There were\nshops on both sides of Kot Kapura   Bathinda Road as well as Kot Kapura  \nMoga Road, besides FCI godown, petrol pump and bus stand near the said\nland. There was also a cinema hall on the Bathinda Road besides large\nnumber of buildings adjoining the acquired land. There were also shops in\nthe acquired land of that case. Consequently, there is no comparison of the\nacquired land of that case with acquired land of the instant case.\nSale deed Ex.A-5 has also rightly been discarded by the\nReference Court because the said sale deed pertains to a small residential\nplot in the abadi, whereas the acquired land is a big chunk of agricultural\nland situated about one kilometer away from abadi. Moreover, sale deed\nEx.A-5 was executed about 1  years after notification under Section 4 of\nthe Act and the same could have been manipulated to claim enhanced\ncompensation. In any event, the said sale deed is not comparable sale\ninstance as it relates to a plot of abadi area.\nSale instances Ex.R-2 to Ex.R-4 produced by the respondents\nare somewhat comparable sale instances because the same relate to sale of\nagricultural land just 6-7 months prior to the date of notification under\nSection 4 of the Act. Land of these sale deeds has been depicted in site plan\nEx. R-1 and the same is just near the acquired land. Land of sale deed\nEx.R-2 even abuts the National Highway. According to the sale deeds\nEx.R-2 to Ex.R-4, the market value of the land was Rs.23,000/- to\nRs.24,000/- per acre only. However, these sale instances were ignored by\nthe Reference Court because even the Land Acquisition Collector has\nawarded compensation at higher rate.\nLearned counsel for the appellants next emphatically contended\nthat the acquired land was located on National Highway and therefore, had\npotential value. Learned counsel for the appellants relying on four\n R. F. A. No. 811 of 1991 \njudgments of this Court in the cases of Surat Singh vs. State of Haryana\nreported as 2000 (1) R.C.R.

KANNAN J.(ORAL)\n.\nThe insurance company is challenging the award on the\nissue of liability. At the trial, report of the licensing authority was\nproduced to the effect that the particular licence No.6739 said to\nhave been issued in the name of the driver had in fact been issued in\nthe name of some other person and not in the name of the driver of\nthe offending vehicle. The Tribunal, on examining the document\nobserved that the licence of the driver bore the date of issue on\n.10.1987 and the report brought form the licensing authority,\ntherefore, was not a proper verification of the particular date on\nwhich the licence of the driver had been issued. Even without\nFAO No.1340 of 1995\n-2-\njoining on the issue of discrepancy, I am still not convinced that the\ninsurer had discharged the burden of proof effectively enough. A\ncommunication from the licensing authority that the particular\nlicence was verified, cannot be taken at its face value and it has to\nbe established before the Tribunal through appropriate evidence by\nsummoning the original register and getting a witness connected\nwith the document to speak about the entry. The insurer cannot be\nsaid to have discharged the burden of proof properly and I would\nhold the insurer liable not merely to satisfy the claim of the\nclaimants but also to indemnify the insured.\n.\nThe award is confirmed and the appeal is dismissed.\n(K.KANNAN)\n JUDGE\nSeptember 21, 2010\nPankaj*"

    "judgment_text": "FAO No. 1738 of 1995\n-1\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB & HARYANA, CHANDIGARH\nFAO No. 1738 of 1995\nDate of decision July 16, 2010 \nNational Insurance Co. Ltd.\n....... Petitioner \nVersus\nSmt. Saroj and others\n........ Respondent\nCORAM: \nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN\n*****\nPresent:-\nMr. Mahataj Bakhsh Singh, Advocate\nfor the appellant.\nK. Kannan, J (oral)\n 1.\nThe Insurance Company is in appeal against the\njudgment of the MACT contending that in spite of the fact that the driver\nwho drove the vehicle was proved to have had a fake driving licence, the\nliability is wrongly cast on it. \n.\nThe liability of the Insurance Co in a case of a fake\nlicence or a renewal of a licence which was a fake one have been\nconsidered by the Hon ble Supreme Court in several cases and the\ndecisions in National Insurance Co v Swaran Singh (2004) 3 SCC 297\nand United Indian Insurance v Divinder Singh (2007) 8 SCC 342 are\ninstructive. In the latter judgment, it has been held that a renewal of a fake\ndriving licence is no licence at all and hence the insurer shall not be liable. \n.\nIt was even held earlier by the Hon ble Supreme\nCourt, while referring to the effect of a renewal of forged licence, in New\nIndia Assurance Co., Shimla v. Kamla,(2001) 4 SCC 342: \n.\n The observation of the Division Bench of the\nPunjab and Haryana High Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sucha\nFAO No. 1738 of 1995\n-2\nSingh that renewal of a document which purports to be a driving licence,\nwill robe even a forged document with validity on account of Section 15 of\nthe Act, propounds a very dangerous proposition. If that proposition is\nallowed to stand as a legal principle, it may, no doubt, thrill counterfeiters\nthe world over as they would be encouraged to manufacture fake\ndocuments in a legion. What was originally a forgery would remain null and\nvoid forever and it would not acquire legal validity at any time by whatever\nprocess of sanctification subsequently done on it. Forgery is antithesis to\nlegality and law cannot afford to validate a forgery.\n.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court in Swaran Singh\n(supra) has an immediate relevance for us in this case for the effect of\nproof of fake licence in the context of the need for discharging the burden\nof proof on the Insurance company that the insured had committed a\nbreach of terms of the policy. The fact that the driver had a fake licence will\nabsolve the insurer of the liability of the insurer only, if it is established that\nthe accident was on account of reasons where the possession of valid\ndriving licence will have relevance for consideration of the aspect of\nnegligence that has to be proved. If the accident was on account of say,\nmechanical defect in the vehicle, the issue of the validity of licence will\nhave no relevance.\n.\nIn this case, the driver has not examined himself\nand there is no evidence about the licence except the copy of the driving\nlicence, which is produced and whose genuineness has been the subject of\nevidence through an officer of the licensing authority with reference to the\nofficial document. The owner has remained ex parte and no evidence is\navailable about his bonafides of enquiry regarding the possession of driving\nlicence by the driver before its entrustment to him. Consequently, the\ninsured shall not have the benefit of indemnity under the policy.\n.\nEven if the insurance company is not liable, the\nFAO No. 1738 of 1995\n-3\nduty to satisfy the award for the claimants cannot be doubted. In \nsuch a situation, the liability to satisfy the award will be accompanied with \na right of recovery from the owner/insured. This cannot be doubted in \nanyway, as specifically provided by the decision of the Supreme Court \nwhile dealing with the effect of proviso to section 149(4) and section\n(5) of the M.V.Act in New India Assurance co v Kamla\n\n (2001\n\n) 4 \nSCC 342:\n. Sub-section (4) of Section 149 of the Act says that so much of the\npolicy as purports to restrict the insurance of the person insured by\nreference to any condition shall  as respects such liabilities as are\nrequired to be covered by a policy ..., be of no effect . The proviso to\nthe said sub-section is important for the purpose of considering the\nquestion involved in this case and hence that proviso is extracted\nbelow:\n Provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge\nof any liability of any person which is covered by the policy by virtue\nonly of this sub-section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that\nperson. \n. Similarly, in this context sub-section (5) is equally important and\nhence that is also extracted below:\n 149. (5) If the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this\nsection to pay in respect of a liability incurred by a person insured by a\npolicy exceeds the amount for which the insurer would apart from the\nprovisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that\nliability, the insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that\nperson. \n. A reading of the proviso to sub-section (4) as well as the language\nemployed in sub-section (5) would indicate that they are intended to\nsafeguard the interest of an insurer who otherwise has no liability to pay\nany amount to the insured but for the provisions contained in Chapter XI\nof the Act. This means, the insurer has to pay to the third parties only\non account of the fact that a policy of insurance has been issued in\nrespect of the vehicle, but the insurer is entitled to recover any such\nsum from the insured if the insurer were not otherwise liable to pay such\nsum to the insured by virtue of the conditions of the contract of\ninsurance indicated by the policy.\n. To repeat, the effect of the above provisions is this: when a valid\ninsurance policy has been issued in respect of a vehicle as evidenced\nby a certificate of insurance the burden is on the insurer to pay to the\nthird parties, whether or not there has been any breach or violation of\nthe policy conditions. But the amount so paid by the insurer to third\nparties can be allowed to be recovered from the insured if as per the\npolicy conditions the insurer had no liability to pay such sum to the\ninsured.\n. The position can be summed up thus:\nThe insurer and the insured are bound by the conditions enumerated in\nthe policy and the insurer is not liable to the insured if there is violation\nof any policy condition. But the insurer who is made statutorily liable to\npay compensation to third parties on account of the certificate of\ninsurance issued shall be entitled to recover from the insured the\nFAO No. 1738 of 1995\n-4\namount paid to the third parties, if there was any breach of policy\nconditions on account of the vehicle being driven without a valid driving\nlicence. Learned counsel for the insured contended that it is enough if\nhe establishes that he made all due enquiries and believed bona fide\nthat the driver employed by him had a valid driving licence, in which\ncase there was no breach of the policy condition.\nThese observations were subsequently cited with approval in Swaran\nSingh s case (supra) also.\n. It is, therefore, evident from the discussions made hereinbefore\nthat the liability of the insurance company to satisfy the decree at the\nfirst \ninstance and to recover the awarded amount from the owner or\ndriver thereof has been holding the field for a long time.\n. Apart from the reasons stated hereinbefore, the doctrine of stare\ndecisis persuades us not to deviate from the said principle.\n \n. The summary of our findings to the various issues as raised in\nthese petitions is as follows:\n(i) Chapter XI of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 providing compulsory\ninsurance of vehicles against third-party risks is a social welfare\nlegislation to extend relief by compensation to victims of accidents\ncaused by use of motor vehicles. The provisions of compulsory\ninsurance coverage of all vehicles are with this paramount object and\nthe provisions of the Act have to be so interpreted as to effectuate the\nsaid object.\n(ii) An insurer is entitled to raise a defence in a claim petition filed under\nSection 163-A or Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, inter alia,\nin terms of Section 149(2)(a)(ii) of the said Act.\n(iii) The breach of policy condition e.g. disqualification of the driver or\ninvalid driving licence of the driver, as contained in sub-section (2)(a)(ii)\nof Section 149, has to be proved to have been committed by the\ninsured for avoiding liability by the insurer. Mere absence, fake or\ninvalid driving licence or disqualification of the driver for driving at the\nrelevant time, are not in themselves defences available to the insurer\nagainst either the insured or the third parties. To avoid its liability\ntowards the insured, the insurer has to prove that the insured was guilty\nof negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care in the matter of\nfulfilling the condition of the policy regarding use of vehicles by a duly\nlicensed driver or one who was not disqualified to drive at the relevant\ntime.\n(iv) Insurance companies, however, with a view to avoid their liability\nmust not only establish the available defence(s) raised in the said\nproceedings but must also establish  breach  on the part of the owner of\nthe vehicle; the burden of proof wherefor would be on them.\n(v) The court cannot lay down any criteria as to how the said burden\nwould be discharged, inasmuch as the same would depend upon the\nfacts and circumstances of each case.\n(vi) Even where the insurer is able to prove breach on the part of the\ninsured concerning the policy condition regarding holding of a valid\nlicence by the driver or his qualification to drive during the relevant\nperiod, the insurer would not be allowed to avoid its liability towards the\ninsured unless the said breach or breaches on the condition of driving\nlicence is/are so fundamental as are found to have contributed to the\ncause of the accident. The Tribunals in interpreting the policy conditions\nwould apply  the rule of main purpose  and the concept of  fundamental\nbreach  to allow defences available to the insurer under Section 149(2)\nof the Act.\n(vii) The question, as to whether the owner has taken reasonable care\nFAO No. 1738 of 1995\n-5\nto find out as to whether the driving licence produced by the driver (a\nfake one or otherwise), does not fulfil the requirements of law or not\nwill have to be determined in each case.\n ..\n(xi) The provisions contained in sub-section (4) with the proviso\nthereunder and sub-section (5) which are intended to cover specified\ncontingencies mentioned therein to enable the insurer to recover the\namount paid under the contract of insurance on behalf of the insured\ncan be taken recourse to by the Tribunal and be extended to claims and\ndefences of the insurer against the insured by relegating them to the\nremedy before regular court in cases where on given facts and\ncircumstances adjudication of their claims inter se might delay the\nadjudication of the claims of the victims.\n.\nUnder the circumstances, the Insurance Company\nshall not be liable to indemnify the insured. The liability is to satisfy the\nclaim under the award with a right of recovery against the insured. The\naward of the Tribunal is modified and the appeal allowed to the above\nextent.\n(K.

      "on 21.10.1991, they had three male children born out of the wedlock and they were about 18, 16 and 12 years of age respectively. In his F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 2 :- petition, the respondent alleged that the behaviour of the appellant towards the respondent and his old mother was indifferent from the very beginning; that she is suffering from some sort of mental disorder with the result that she refused to cook meals for him and the minor children; that she levelled false allegations qua the character of the respondent; that she gave severe beatings to the mother of the respondent on 22.9.1990 and that as a result thereof, he filed a divorce petition in which the appellant allegedly made a statement on 13.3.1991 that she will not misbehave in future with the respondent or his mother and undertook not to file any complaints against him either to the police or to the higher authorities of the Board; that the matter was compromised and the petition for dissolution of the marriage was withdrawn. [3]. The respondent has further averred that soon after the above stated compromise, the appellant allegedly refused to honour her words and started making false and frivolous complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda alleging that she had fear for her life at the hands of the respondent. The respondent alleged that he along with the children has been forced to live in the small rented house and that he has a vast circle of friends but the appellant allegedly refused to look after the visitors and forced the respondent to cook meals, clean utensils and wash the clothes of the children also . This fact was allegedly noticed by the relatives and friends of the respondent who used to visit the house thereby causing great mental cruelty to him as the respondent's reputation stood blotted. It was further alleged that the appellant in connivance with her father broke open the locks of the house which is under the possession of his mother and valuable articles were removed.... . It was also alleged that F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 3 :- the appellant threatened the respondent to get him physically liquidated . On the strength of these allegations, the respondent sought dissolution of their marriage by a decree of divorce. [4]. The appellant contested the above stated petition vide her reply dated 16.12.1992 and took a preliminary objection that the respondent in fact was taking advantage of his own wrongs as it was he who subjected her to cruelty even though she wanted to lead a honorable life with him. The appellant specifically averred that the respondent has deserted her with ulterior motive and has declined to give food and shelter . On merits, the appellant took the plea that soon after their marriage, the respondent started harassing her for bringing insufficient dowry and did not even attend the marriage of her brother held in the year 1974. She alleged that till the time her father-in-law was alive, the respondent used to behave reasonably well, however, after his death in the year 1978, he started beating her mercilessly and on many occasions refused to provide food or woolen clothes during winters. It was alleged that for the last over five years, the respondent has been continuously beating her so badly and ruthlessly that it has also affected her eye sight. She denied the allegations that she refused to cook food for the respondent, their children or her mother-in-law or that she ever made any false complaints against the respondent to the authorities. In para of the written statement, the appellant specifically alleged that in fact the respondent desired to re-marry and wanted to get rid of her . She further alleged that the previous divorce petition was withdrawn by the respondent after stating that he had compromised the matter and shall not beat her and will behave properly in future. In fact the divorce petition was withdrawn by him to avoid maintenance pendente-lite and litigation expenses. The F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 4 :- appellant specifically averred that she never refused to accompany the respondent, rather it is he who refused to take the respondent to his home . She further averred that since the respondent wanted to turn her out of the matrimonial home, he himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813 Bhatinda and thereafter got filed eviction application against her from his mother alleging therein that she was a tenant in the house. The appellant admitted that she had to approach the Deputy Commissioner Bhatinda as her life and liberty was at stake for the reason that the respondent sent hired unsocial elements at midnight at her residence on 2nd May, 1991 and 4th May, 1991 who was later on caught by the neighbours and was given severe beatings. Fortunately, her father was with her at that time. [5]. In his rejoinder, the respondent husband not only reiterated the allegations, he further averred that since he refused to pay Rs.25,000/- to the brother of the appellant who wanted to expand his business of welding material, she became totally arrogant and threatened him that she will take revenge later on. Admitting the poor eye sight of the appellant, the respondent averred that she is suffering from an inherited disease.... which cannot be cured.... . He denied the allegations that he wanted to re-marry. [6]. On the basis of the pleadings, following issues were framed by the learned trial court:- 1. Whether respondent has deserted the petitioner without any sufficient and reasonable cause? OPA . Whether the respondent is guilty of cruelty as alleged in the petition? OPA . Whether the respondent is entitled to special costs as F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 5 :- alleged in the written statement? OPR . Whether the petitioner has no cause of action and locus standi to file the petition? . Relief. [7]. In order to discharge his onus qua issues No.1 and 2, the respondent examined formal witnesses Prem Kumar (AW1), who is a record-keeper in the Sessions Division at Bhatinda and produced the file of previous divorce petition HMA No.35 dated 28.9.1990 decided on .3.1991 as well as Surjit Singh (AW2), who being Reader to the Court of Additional District Judge Bhatinda on 13.3.1991, had recorded the statements of the parties. The respondent also examined Om Parkash (AW3), ASI Kashmir Singh (AW4), Uzagar Singh (AW5), Amrik Singh (AW6), Constable Dalbir Singh (AW7), Head Constable Gurcharan Kaur (AW8), respondent, himself as (AW9) and Madan Lal Sharma (AW10) and also relied upon documents Ex.A1 to A8. [8]. The appellant, on the other hand, examined her brother Amar Nath Gupta (RW1) and she herself entered the witness box as (RW2). She also relied upon the documents Ex.R1 to R6. [9]. Upon appreciation of the above stated evidence and while deciding the issues No.1 and 2 together, the learned Additional District Judge held that the appellant refused to prepare tea for the visitors, she often abused her husband and made false complaints against him to the police and his colleagues/superiors. The appellant's statement dated 13.3.1991 (Ex.A1) in the previous divorce petition, which was compromised, has also been relied upon to arrive at the aforesaid conclusion. The learned trial court also placed reliance upon Ex.A4, a report alleged to have been made by HC F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 6 :- Gurcharan Kaur and concluded that, there is no rebuttal to documentary evidence of the petitioner regarding the alleged cruelty by the respondent and that the appellant only wanted to extract money from the petitioner by filing various petitions and applications before the police . The learned trial court held that it was a case of causing 'mental cruelty' to the husband who made every effort to join the respondent in his company . The learned trial court further held that the appellant-wife has deserted the respondent without any sufficient and reasonable cause... . Both the issues were accordingly answered against the appellant, resulting into passing of the impugned judgment and decree. [10]. I have heard Learned Counsel for the parties, perused the pleadings, the impugned judgment as well as the evidence on record. [11]. Before adverting to issue No.2, i.e., whether or not the respondent is guilty of cruelty as alleged in the petition , I firstly propose to deal with issue No.1, as to whether she had deserted the respondent without any sufficient and reasonable cause? . [12]. If one reads the petition under Section 13 of the Act dated .10.1991 , it is evident in unequivocal terms that no allegations, what-so- ever, that the appellant ever deserted her husband without any sufficient cause, have been made. The entire petition is founded upon the allegations of cruelty and it is in that process that the respondent in para 8 of the petition has averred that he along with his sons, who are studying in Convent School and DAV College, Bhatinda respectively, have been forced to live in the small rented house . No averment that the appellant voluntarily left her matrimonial home and, thus, deserted the respondent, has been made. In the absence of such allegations, how issue No.1 was F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 7 :- framed, is beyond comprehension. Be that as it may, it is the admitted fact that house no.3880, Neeta Street, behind Gurdwara Singh Sabha, Bhatinda is owned by the respondent or his mother. The parties were admittedly residing in the said house only, as the respondent himself gave the same address for both the parties in his first divorce petition No. HMA35 dated .9.1990. The parties were, thus, residing under the same roof not only in the year 1990 but also at the time when they compromised their matrimonial dispute on 13.3.1991. In para 6 of her written statement, the appellant wife has specifically averred that the respondent husband himself left the house along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813 Bhatinda . This fact has been admitted by the respondent in para 8 of the divorce petition though in a different manner. Not only this, the appellant admittedly continues to stay in the same house owned by the respondent or his mother even though the respondent attempted to throw her out by getting an eviction petition filed through his mother. The appellant's specific stand that an eviction petition was filed by her mother-in-law alleging her to be a tenant in the premises, has not been controverted by the respondent in his rejoinder. If that is so, the conclusion drawn by the learned trial court that the appellant has deserted her husband without any sufficient cause is totally contrary to the evidence on record. It is the respondent who concededly left the matrimonial home and shifted to a rented accommodation. The finding returned by the learned trial court on issue No.1, therefore, cannot sustain and is accordingly set aside. [13]. This takes us to the crucial issue as to who out of the two subjected the other to cruelty of such a high degree that the matrimonial tie had to be snapped by a decree of divorce. F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 8 :- [14]. At the cost of repetition, it may be noticed that in order to prove the allegation of cruelty at the hands of the appellant, the respondent has alleged that she (i) refused to cook meals for the family; (ii) levelled false allegations on the character of the respondent; (iii) gave beatings to the mother of the respondent; (iv) admitted these allegations in her statement on .3.1991 in the previous divorce petition when she said that she will not misbehave in future; (v) moved false and frivolous complaints to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda; (vi) in connivance with her father, broke open the locks of the house and removed the valuables; and (vii) threatened the petitioner to get him physically liquidated. [15]. To prove the above reproduced first allegation, the respondent in addition to his own statement, has examined Om Parkash (AW3). The said witness has deposed that whenever he visited the house of the petitioner and he requested the respondent to prepare tea, she refused for all the times . He, however, has admitted that he did not know as to whether the respondent used to prepare meals for her husband, mother-in-law and children as according to the witness, he did not sit in the house all the times . The statement of this witness inspires no confidence at all. He was a family friend of the respondent. No date, month or year of his alleged visit to the house of the respondent has been disclosed by him. A sweeping statement by an interested witness, which is totally vague in nature, cannot be termed as a reliable evidence. So far as the respondent's own version is concerned, no credence can be given to the same as it would be revealed that he was hellbent on throwing the appellant out of her matrimonial home on one pretext or the other. The second instance of cruelty is sought to be substantiated through Uzagar Singh (AW5) who has deposed that the F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 9 :- appellant used to abuse the respondent. In his cross examination, he had to concede that he did not remember as to when did he visit the residence of the parties. He admits that the appellant visited his residence and complained that her husband is not paying any maintenance nor keeping her with him . If those were the state of affairs that the appellant wife had to rush to one family friend or the other for her sustenance, how could the appellant be held guilty of subjecting the respondent to cruelty? The other witness Amrik Singh (AW6) - a Junior Engineer is also a colleague of the respondent. While he claims that the appellant used to go to the office of the XEN/SDO for making complaints against her husband and used to utter obnoxious remarks against him, he admits having no knowledge as to whether or not the respondent provided food and clothing to his wife and/or paid maintenance. Interestingly, the complaint (Ex.A8) produced by Constable Dalbir Singh is a complaint made by the mother of the respondent against the appellant before the SSP, Bhatinda. How on the earth the said document could be relied upon against the appellant to establish the alleged cruelty by her towards the respondent, is beyond any legal fiction. The learned trial court, however, has taken these self-serving complaints made by the respondent or his mother also as an evidence against the appellant. [16]. This takes us to the third incident, namely, a complaint by the appellant to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda. The appellant has candidly admitted in her written statement as well as in her deposition that she made a complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda. She has, however, given a specific reason, namely, that in the midnight of 2.5.1991 and 4.5.1991 respectively, the respondent sent an unsocial element hired by him to her residence who was caught and thrashed by the neighbours. F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 10 :- Fortunately, the father of the appellant was staying with her during those days. The respondent has not been able to dispute this occurrence specifically. Had she been all alone, any untoward incident could have taken place. In these circumstances when the respondent was adopting all sorts of dubious means to brow-beat and terrorize the appellant so as to force her to vacate the house of his mother, what sin the appellant had committed by approaching the district administration for the protection of her life and liberty? This was a lawful action taken by her, which, with no stretch of imagination, can be termed as an act of cruelty on her part. [17]. Adverting to the allegation that the appellant gave beatings to the mother of the respondent, firstly, no evidence of causing such beatings, like medico-legal report, etc. has been brought on record. No independent person, who might have witnessed such an incident, has come forward to depose. Even the mother of the respondent has not come and deposed. Not only this, the eldest child of the parties was 18 years old when the divorce petition was filed. Even he could have been produced to depose the truth. In the absence of an iota of evidence, no reliance on the bald statement of the respondent, can be placed. There is no other evidence to support the allegation that the respondent was ever subjected to cruelty by the appellant. The conclusion drawn by the learned trial court on issue No.2 is also, thus, contrary to the evidence on record and is, therefore, reversed. [18]. There are, however, more than one reason to hold that the respondent founded his petition upon totally false allegations and it is rather he who has subjected the appellant with extreme cruelty. The evidence on record does suggest that she was physically tortured and has been deprived of basic necessities for survival and to live with dignity. She has lost her F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 11 :- eye sight due to cruel and callous attitude of the respondent who could not muster the strength to deny the said truth though has sought to explain that the appellant was not taken for treatment, as she was suffering from an incurable hereditary disease . It cannot be overlooked that it was a case where the marriage was solemnized long back in the year 1973. No fault was found with the appellant's behaviour when three children were sired and they grew up enough to look after themselves independently. It is thereafter only that the respondent started finding consistent faults with the appellant. From the zimni orders passed by the learned trial court, it is apparent that the respondent has been adopting one or the other unsavory means to delay or deny the payment of maintenance to the appellant. She was forced to visit the offices of higher authorities of the respondent as well as his friends in order to persuade him to pay maintenance to her. The fact that the respondent also got filed an 'eviction petition' through his mother to render the appellant homeless, is yet another strong circumstance to exhibit his vengeance against the appellant. [19]. The appellant's allegation that the respondent himself left the matrimonial home as he did not want to live with her, is further proved by the fact that on 28.8.1993, the divorce petition was put before the Lok Adalat where he compromised the matter and agreed to take the appellant with him. He, however, turned around and later on made a statement that the situation has changed and he is not ready to keep her . It is also on record that even for the recovery of the arrears of maintenance, the appellant was forced to file a civil suit. [20]. For the reasons afore-stated, the impugned judgment dated .6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, being contrary to F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 12 :- the facts and evidence on record, is liable to be set aside. [21]. The matter, however, is not as simple as to be rested here. The parties were married in the year 1973. They have been admittedly living separately since the year 1991. Their children have grown up and are married. In order to find out an amicable solution, their eldest son was also asked to be present in Court. He did come. The parties were heard in person also. The appellant is in a pitiable condition. She has almost turned blind and is now confined to a one room accommodation, which is stated to be in a dilapidated condition. The respondent has refused to carry out the necessary repairs even when the appellant's right to residence is a part and parcel of her right to maintenance. (Ref: B.P. Achala Anand v. S. Appi Reddy, (2005)3 SCC 313) She cannot spare money out of a meagre amount of Rs.600/- which she is getting as maintenance pendente-lite. Though the appellant's suit for recovery was decreed by both the courts below, however, the Regular Second Appeal preferred by the respondent was admitted and operation of those judgments was stayed. She, thus, could not recover even a penny from the respondent. In these peculiar circumstances, the intervention of the parties' son was sought but he too expressed his helplessness in resolving the dispute. As the respondent took a categoric stand not to take the appellant to her matrimonial home in any circumstance, the appellant was persuaded and she reluctantly agreed to part ways on payment of a reasonable and respectable lump-sum amount, a part of which she urgently requires for her eyes' surgery and repair of the one room house. This was also not acceptable to the respondent. [22]. As the parties are living separately from the last 15 years and the bad blood against each other is still boiling hot, it is undoubtedly a case F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 13 :- of irretrievably broken marriage. The parties are at a point of no-return. While the respondent cannot encash his own misdeeds, the appellant also need not be foisted upon him at this stage as he is not ready to accept her for the re-beginning of their married life. The solution to such a dilemma lies in the principles enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohni, 2006(4) SCC 558. Applying the dictum laid therein and keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, as noticed above, I uphold the decree of divorce not on the ground of 'cruelty' or 'desertion' as granted by the learned trial court, rather after holding that it is a case of irrepairable broken marriage. The marriage is totally dead and has ceased to exist. The parties have no sentiments for each other. The decree of divorce, granted by the trial court, therefore, is kept intact subject to, however, the condition that the respondent husband shall pay a total sum of Rs.5 lacs to the appellant within a period of six months, i.e., a sum of Rs.1 lacs shall be paid by him within one month from the date of receipt of a certified copy of this order and the remaining four lacs in two equal installments of Rs.2 lacs each, the first one to be paid two months after the payment of Rs.1 lac and the balance amount of Rs.2 lacs shall be paid by him in another three months thereafter. [23]. The lump-sum amount has been awarded after taking notice of the fact that the respondent has not only got lacs of rupees towards retiral benefits, he, along with his sons, is also running flourishing business including an industrial unit. He is, thus, financially sound and capable to part with the aforesaid amount. [24]. However, if the respondent fails to pay the afore-stated amount to the appellant within the prescribed time schedule, in that event the appeal F.A.O. No.117-M of 1996 -: 14 :- shall stand allowed and as a result thereof the judgment and decree dated .6.1993 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Bhatinda would be taken to have been set aside with costs of Rs.15,000/-.

Sud, Advocate for the appellant.\nShri Raman Mahajan, Advocate for the respondent.\nORDER\nSurya Kant, J. - This Appeal has been filed by the wife against the\njudgment dated 3.6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge,\nBhatinda whereby a petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act\n(for short the Act) on the ground of cruelty and desertion, preferred by the\nrespondent   husband, has been accepted and their marriage has been\ndissolved by a decree of divorce.\n[2].\nThe marriage between the parties was solemnized on 19.2.1973\nat Patiala. At the time when the subject divorce petition was filed by the\nhusband on 21.10.1991, they had three male children born out of the\nwedlock and they were about 18, 16 and 12 years of age respectively. In his\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 2 :-\npetition, the respondent alleged that the behaviour of the appellant towards\nthe respondent and his old mother was  indifferent  from the very\nbeginning; that she is  suffering from some sort of mental disorder  with the\nresult that she refused to cook meals for him and the minor children; that\nshe  levelled false allegations qua the character  of the respondent; that she\ngave severe beatings to the mother of the respondent on 22.9.1990 and that\nas a result thereof, he filed a divorce petition in which the appellant\nallegedly made a statement on 13.3.1991 that she will not misbehave in\nfuture with the respondent or his mother and undertook not to file any\ncomplaints against him either to the police or to the higher authorities of the\nBoard; that the matter was compromised and the petition for dissolution of\nthe marriage was withdrawn.\n[3].\nThe respondent has further averred that soon after the above\nstated compromise, the appellant allegedly refused to honour her words and\nstarted making  false and frivolous complaint  to the Deputy\nCommissioner, Bhatinda alleging that she had fear for her life at the hands\nof the respondent. The respondent alleged that he along with the children\nhas been forced to  live in the small rented house  and that he has a vast\ncircle of friends but the appellant allegedly refused to look after the visitors\nand forced the respondent to  cook meals, clean utensils and wash the\nclothes of the children also . This fact was allegedly noticed by the\nrelatives and friends of the respondent who used to visit the house thereby\ncausing great mental cruelty to him as the respondent's reputation stood\nblotted. It was further alleged that the appellant in connivance with her\nfather  broke open the locks of the house which is under the possession of\nhis mother and valuable articles were removed.... . It was also alleged that\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 3 :-\nthe appellant threatened the respondent  to get him physically liquidated .\nOn the strength of these allegations, the respondent sought dissolution of\ntheir marriage by a decree of divorce.\n[4].\nThe appellant contested the above stated petition vide her reply\ndated 16.12.1992 and took a preliminary objection that the respondent in\nfact was taking advantage of his own wrongs as it was he who subjected her\nto cruelty even though she wanted to lead a honorable life with him. The\nappellant specifically averred that the respondent has deserted her  with\nulterior motive and has declined to give food and shelter . On merits, the\nappellant took the plea that soon after their marriage, the respondent started\nharassing her for bringing insufficient dowry and did not even attend the\nmarriage of her brother held in the year 1974. She alleged that till the time\nher father-in-law was alive, the respondent used to behave reasonably well,\nhowever, after his death in the year 1978, he started beating her mercilessly\nand on many occasions refused to provide food or woolen clothes during\nwinters. It was alleged that for the last over five years, the respondent has\nbeen continuously beating her so badly and ruthlessly that it has also\naffected her eye sight. She denied the allegations that she refused to cook\nfood for the respondent, their children or her mother-in-law or that she ever\nmade any false complaints against the respondent to the authorities. In para\nof the written statement, the appellant specifically alleged that in fact the\nrespondent  desired to re-marry and wanted to get rid of her . She further\nalleged that the previous divorce petition was withdrawn by the respondent\nafter stating that he had compromised the matter and shall not beat her and\nwill behave properly in future. In fact the divorce petition was withdrawn\nby him to avoid maintenance pendente-lite and litigation expenses. The\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 4 :-\nappellant specifically averred that she never refused to accompany the\nrespondent, rather it is he  who refused to take the respondent to his home .\nShe further averred that since the respondent wanted to turn her out of the\nmatrimonial home, he  himself left the house along with children and\nstarted residing in Ganesha Basti in House No.W-4/813 Bhatinda  and\nthereafter got filed eviction application against her from his mother alleging\ntherein that she was a tenant in the house. The appellant admitted that she\nhad to approach the Deputy Commissioner Bhatinda as her life and liberty\nwas at stake for the reason that the respondent sent  hired unsocial elements\nat midnight at her residence  on 2nd May, 1991 and 4th May, 1991 who was\nlater on caught by the neighbours and was given severe beatings.\nFortunately, her father was with her at that time.\n[5].\nIn his rejoinder, the respondent   husband not only reiterated\nthe allegations, he further averred that since he refused to pay Rs.25,000/- to\nthe brother of the appellant who wanted to expand his business of welding\nmaterial, she became totally arrogant and threatened him that she will take\nrevenge later on. Admitting the poor eye sight of the appellant, the\nrespondent averred that she is suffering from an  inherited disease.... which\ncannot be cured.... . He denied the allegations that he wanted to re-marry.\n[6].\nOn the basis of the pleadings, following issues were framed by\nthe learned trial court:-\n 1. Whether respondent has deserted the petitioner\nwithout any sufficient and reasonable cause? OPA\n. Whether the respondent is guilty of cruelty as alleged\nin the petition? OPA\n. Whether the respondent is entitled to special costs as\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 5 :-\nalleged in the written statement? OPR\n. Whether the petitioner has no cause of action and locus\nstandi to file the petition?\n. Relief. \n[7].\nIn order to discharge his onus qua issues No.1 and 2, the\nrespondent examined formal witnesses Prem Kumar (AW1), who is a\nrecord-keeper in the Sessions Division at Bhatinda and produced the file of\nprevious divorce petition HMA No.35 dated 28.9.1990 decided on\n.3.1991 as well as Surjit Singh (AW2), who being Reader to the Court of\nAdditional District Judge Bhatinda on 13.3.1991, had recorded the\nstatements of the parties. The respondent also examined Om Parkash\n(AW3), ASI Kashmir Singh (AW4), Uzagar Singh (AW5), Amrik Singh\n(AW6), Constable Dalbir Singh (AW7), Head Constable Gurcharan Kaur\n(AW8), respondent, himself as (AW9) and Madan Lal Sharma (AW10) and\nalso relied upon documents Ex.A1 to A8.\n[8].\nThe appellant, on the other hand, examined her brother Amar\nNath Gupta (RW1) and she herself entered the witness box as (RW2). She\nalso relied upon the documents Ex.R1 to R6.\n[9].\nUpon appreciation of the above stated evidence and while\ndeciding the issues No.1 and 2 together, the learned Additional District\nJudge held that the appellant refused to prepare tea for the visitors, she often\nabused her husband and made false complaints against him to the police and\nhis colleagues/superiors. The appellant's statement dated 13.3.1991 (Ex.A1)\nin the previous divorce petition, which was compromised, has also been\nrelied upon to arrive at the aforesaid conclusion. The learned trial court also\nplaced reliance upon Ex.A4, a report alleged to have been made by HC\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 6 :-\nGurcharan Kaur and concluded that,  there is no rebuttal to documentary\nevidence of the petitioner regarding the alleged cruelty by the respondent \nand that the appellant  only wanted to extract money from the petitioner by\nfiling various petitions and applications before the police . The learned trial\ncourt held that it was a case of causing 'mental cruelty' to the husband who\n made every effort to join the respondent in his company . The learned trial\ncourt further held that the appellant-wife has deserted the respondent\n without any sufficient and reasonable cause... . Both the issues were\naccordingly answered against the appellant, resulting into passing of the\nimpugned judgment and decree.\n[10].\nI have heard Learned Counsel for the parties, perused the\npleadings, the impugned judgment as well as the evidence on record.\n[11].\nBefore adverting to issue No.2, i.e.,  whether or not the\nrespondent is guilty of cruelty as alleged in the petition , I firstly propose to\ndeal with issue No.1, as to whether she had  deserted the respondent\nwithout any sufficient and reasonable cause? .\n[12].\nIf one reads the petition under Section 13 of the Act dated\n.10.1991 , it is evident in unequivocal terms that no allegations, what-so-\never, that the appellant ever deserted her husband without any sufficient\ncause, have been made. The entire petition is founded upon the allegations\nof cruelty and it is in that process that the respondent in para 8 of the\npetition has averred that he along with his sons, who are studying in\nConvent School and DAV College, Bhatinda respectively,  have been\nforced to live in the small rented house . No averment that the appellant\nvoluntarily left her matrimonial home and, thus, deserted the respondent,\nhas been made. In the absence of such allegations, how issue No.1 was\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 7 :-\nframed, is beyond comprehension. Be that as it may, it is the admitted fact\nthat house no.3880, Neeta Street, behind Gurdwara Singh Sabha, Bhatinda\nis owned by the respondent or his mother. The parties were admittedly\nresiding in the said house only, as the respondent himself gave the same\naddress for both the parties in his first divorce petition No. HMA35 dated\n.9.1990. The parties were, thus, residing under the same roof not only in\nthe year 1990 but also at the time when they compromised their matrimonial\ndispute on 13.3.1991. In para 6 of her written statement, the appellant  \nwife has specifically averred that the respondent   husband  himself left the\nhouse along with children and started residing in Ganesha Basti in House\nNo.W-4/813 Bhatinda . This fact has been admitted by the respondent in\npara 8 of the divorce petition though in a different manner. Not only this,\nthe appellant admittedly continues to stay in the same house owned by the\nrespondent or his mother even though the respondent attempted to throw her\nout by getting an eviction petition filed through his mother. The appellant's\nspecific stand that an eviction petition was filed by her mother-in-law\nalleging her to be a tenant in the premises, has not been controverted by the\nrespondent in his rejoinder. If that is so, the conclusion drawn by the\nlearned trial court that the appellant has deserted her husband without any\n sufficient cause  is totally contrary to the evidence on record. It is the\nrespondent who concededly left the matrimonial home and shifted to a\nrented accommodation. The finding returned by the learned trial court on\nissue No.1, therefore, cannot sustain and is accordingly set aside.\n[13].\nThis takes us to the crucial issue as to who out of the two\nsubjected the other to cruelty of such a high degree that the matrimonial tie\nhad to be snapped by a decree of divorce.\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 8 :-\n[14].\nAt the cost of repetition, it may be noticed that in order to prove\nthe allegation of cruelty at the hands of the appellant, the respondent has\nalleged that she (i) refused to cook meals for the family; (ii) levelled false\nallegations on the character of the respondent; (iii) gave beatings to the\nmother of the respondent; (iv) admitted these allegations in her statement on\n.3.1991 in the previous divorce petition when she said that she will not\nmisbehave in future; (v) moved false and frivolous complaints to the Deputy\nCommissioner, Bhatinda; (vi) in connivance with her father, broke open the\nlocks of the house and removed the valuables; and (vii) threatened the\npetitioner to get him physically liquidated.\n[15].\nTo prove the above reproduced first allegation, the respondent\nin addition to his own statement, has examined Om Parkash (AW3). The\nsaid witness has deposed that whenever he  visited the house of the\npetitioner and he requested the respondent to prepare tea, she refused for all\nthe times . He, however, has admitted that  he did not know as to whether\nthe respondent used to prepare meals for her husband, mother-in-law and\nchildren  as according to the witness, he  did not sit in the house all the\ntimes . The statement of this witness inspires no confidence at all. He was\na family friend of the respondent. No date, month or year of his alleged visit\nto the house of the respondent has been disclosed by him. A sweeping\nstatement by an interested witness, which is totally vague in nature, cannot\nbe termed as a reliable evidence. So far as the respondent's own version is\nconcerned, no credence can be given to the same as it would be revealed\nthat he was hellbent on throwing the appellant out of her matrimonial home\non one pretext or the other. The second instance of cruelty is sought to be\nsubstantiated through Uzagar Singh (AW5) who has deposed that the\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 9 :-\nappellant  used to abuse  the respondent. In his cross examination, he had\nto concede that he did not remember as to when did he visit the residence of\nthe parties. He admits that the appellant visited his residence and\ncomplained that her husband is not  paying any maintenance nor keeping\nher with him . If those were the state of affairs that the appellant wife had\nto rush to one family friend or the other for her sustenance, how could the\nappellant be held guilty of subjecting the respondent to cruelty? The other\nwitness Amrik Singh (AW6) - a Junior Engineer is also a colleague of the\nrespondent. While he claims that the appellant used to go to the office of\nthe XEN/SDO for making complaints against her husband and used to utter\nobnoxious remarks against him, he admits having no knowledge as to\nwhether or not the respondent provided food and clothing to his wife and/or\npaid maintenance. Interestingly, the complaint (Ex.A8) produced by\nConstable Dalbir Singh is a complaint made by the mother of the respondent\nagainst the appellant before the SSP, Bhatinda. How on the earth the said\ndocument could be relied upon against the appellant to establish the alleged\ncruelty by her towards the respondent, is beyond any legal fiction. The\nlearned trial court, however, has taken these self-serving complaints made\nby the respondent or his mother also as an evidence against the appellant. \n[16].\nThis takes us to the third incident, namely, a complaint by the\nappellant to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda. The appellant has\ncandidly admitted in her written statement as well as in her deposition that\nshe made a complaint to the Deputy Commissioner, Bhatinda. She has,\nhowever, given a specific reason, namely, that in the midnight of 2.5.1991\nand 4.5.1991 respectively, the respondent sent an unsocial element hired by\nhim to her residence who was caught and thrashed by the neighbours.\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 10 :-\nFortunately, the father of the appellant was staying with her during those\ndays. The respondent has not been able to dispute this occurrence\nspecifically. Had she been all alone, any untoward incident could have\ntaken place. In these circumstances when the respondent was adopting all\nsorts of dubious means to brow-beat and terrorize the appellant so as to\nforce her to vacate the house of his mother, what sin the appellant had\ncommitted by approaching the district administration for the protection of\nher life and liberty? This was a lawful action taken by her, which, with no\nstretch of imagination, can be termed as an act of cruelty on her part.\n[17].\nAdverting to the allegation that the appellant gave beatings to\nthe mother of the respondent, firstly, no evidence of causing such beatings,\nlike medico-legal report, etc. has been brought on record. No independent\nperson, who might have witnessed such an incident, has come forward to\ndepose. Even the mother of the respondent has not come and deposed. Not\nonly this, the eldest child of the parties was 18 years old when the divorce\npetition was filed. Even he could have been produced to depose the truth.\nIn the absence of an iota of evidence, no reliance on the bald statement of\nthe respondent, can be placed. There is no other evidence to support the\nallegation that the respondent was ever subjected to cruelty by the appellant.\nThe conclusion drawn by the learned trial court on issue No.2 is also, thus,\ncontrary to the evidence on record and is, therefore, reversed.\n[18].\nThere are, however, more than one reason to hold that the\nrespondent founded his petition upon totally false allegations and it is rather\nhe who has subjected the appellant with extreme cruelty. The evidence on\nrecord does suggest that she was physically tortured and has been deprived\nof basic necessities for survival and to live with dignity. She has lost her\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 11 :-\neye sight due to cruel and callous attitude of the respondent who could not\nmuster the strength to deny the said truth though has sought to explain that\nthe appellant was not taken for treatment, as she was suffering from an\n incurable hereditary disease . It cannot be overlooked that it was a case\nwhere the marriage was solemnized long back in the year 1973. No fault\nwas found with the appellant's behaviour when three children were sired and\nthey grew up enough to look after themselves independently. It is thereafter\nonly that the respondent started finding consistent faults with the appellant.\nFrom the zimni orders passed by the learned trial court, it is apparent that the\nrespondent has been adopting one or the other unsavory means to delay or\ndeny the payment of maintenance to the appellant. She was forced to visit\nthe offices of higher authorities of the respondent as well as his friends in\norder to persuade him to pay maintenance to her. The fact that the\nrespondent also got filed an 'eviction petition' through his mother to render\nthe appellant homeless, is yet another strong circumstance to exhibit his\nvengeance against the appellant. \n[19].\nThe appellant's allegation that the respondent himself left the\nmatrimonial home as he did not want to live with her, is further proved by\nthe fact that on 28.8.1993, the divorce petition was put before the Lok\nAdalat where he compromised the matter and agreed to take the appellant\nwith him. He, however, turned around and later on made a statement that\nthe  situation has changed and he is not ready to keep her . It is also on\nrecord that even for the recovery of the arrears of maintenance, the appellant\nwas forced to file a civil suit. \n[20].\nFor the reasons afore-stated, the impugned judgment dated\n.6.1996 passed by the learned Additional District Judge, being contrary to\nF.A.O. No.117-M of 1996\n-: 12 :-\nthe facts and evidence on record, is liable to be set aside. \n[21].\nThe matter, however, is not as simple as to be rested here. The\nparties were married in the year 1973. They have been admittedly living\nseparately since the year 1991. Their children have grown up and are\nmarried. In order to find out an amicable solution, their eldest son was also\nasked to be present in Court. He did come. The parties were heard in\nperson also. The appellant is in a pitiable condition. She has almost turned\nblind and is now confined to a one room accommodation, which is stated to\nbe in a dilapidated condition. The respondent has refused to carry out the\nnecessary repairs even when the appellant's right to residence is a part and\nparcel of her right to maintenance. (Ref: B.P. Achala Anand v. S. Appi\nReddy, (2005)3 SCC 313) She cannot spare money out of a meagre amount\nof Rs.600/- which she is getting as maintenance pendente-lite. Though the\nappellant's suit for recovery was decreed by both the courts below, however,\nthe Regular Second Appeal preferred by the respondent was admitted and\noperation of those judgments was stayed. She, thus, could not recover even\na penny from the respondent.

The parties are at a point of no-return.\nWhile the respondent cannot encash his own misdeeds, the appellant also\nneed not be foisted upon him at this stage as he is not ready to accept her\nfor the re-beginning of their married life. The solution to such a dilemma\nlies in the principles enunciated by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of\nNaveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohni, 2006(4) SCC 558.

After the marriage the parties resided at Pehowa, District Kurukshetra but the marriage was not consummated and, thus, no child was FAO No. 151-M of 1996 born out of the wedlock. On the first night the respondent wife declared to the petitioner that her marriage with the petitioner was performed against her wishes and on account of threat of her father of committing suicide in case of her refusal to marry the appellant-petitioner. It was also the case set up by the appellant-husband that respondent-wife claimed that she had waited for more than 40 years to marry a boy of her choice but her desire has not been fulfilled and, therefore, she would not permit the petitioner to consumate the marriage. Appellant further claimed that respondent did not resume cohabitation with the appellant-petitioner. The appellant did not disclose this fact to his parents on the next morning and rather tried to persuade the respondent so that she should not create tensions and problem, and should behave liken an Indian lady and to forget her past life. The respondent wife instead of mending herself, became arrogant, harsh and cruel to the petitioner as well as his family members. Thereafter father of the respondent was called and everything was made clear to him but nothing tangible came out. The appellant-petitioner was posted at Dhariwal, as an Inspector in Border Security Force, which was terrorist affected area and, therefore, he was granted one week's leave for the marriage and he on expiry of leave went back to his duty at Dhariwal. It is case of the appellant that the marriage was never consummated. The respondent left the matrimonial home and went to her parents house at Ambala City. It was only on persuasion of father of the petitioner and other relations, who visited the house of respondent at FAO No. 151-M of 1996 Ambala City, it was decided that the petitioner should keep the respondent at Dhariwal for a week and accordingly in the month of December, 1989 respondent went to Dhariwal where the petitioner was posted. The appellant-petitioner made arrangement for her stay in a house of some one but during her stay at Dhariwal also, the behaviour of the respondent remained the same. It is also allegation of the appellant-petitioner that he invited some officers of the B.S.F. to celebrate but respondent refused to attend the celebration which was a very humiliating for the appellant. It is also the allegation that when appellant invited some of his colleagues the respondent refused to join them and slept in a room complaining of headache and this cruel act of the respondent forced the petitioner to spend sleepless nights. Even during her stay at Dhariwal she did not permit the appellant-petitioner to consummate the marriage as respondent gave threat that she would commit suicide if she was forced to live with him. Only after a week respondent forced him to drop her at Ambala City. The appellant claimed that on persuasion of his parents he took one month's leave for the period 20.12.1989 to 20.1.1990 when father of the respondent brought her to Pehowa and advised the respondent to live like a pious lady but all in vain. On the first night during their stay at Pehowa during the vacations, the respondent wife wiped out her 'Sindoor' and 'Bindi' affixed on her forehead and broke all the bangles with a threat that ties of the marriage with the appellant-petitioner had been broken. The respondent did not allow the petitioner to touch her body with the same threat of FAO No. 151-M of 1996 committing suicide. In view of the allegations made above, it was pleaded that the life of the appellant was turned into hell. The respondent stayed at Pehowa only for ten days during the leave of one month. He again reported for his duty on 20.1.1990. The respondent-thereafter was again brought to Pehowa after a great persuasion by the father of the petitioner with the help of a Panchayat consisting of Durga Dass, Pawan Kumar and Surender Pal but the respondent again left the matrimonial home in the month of March, 1990 without permission of the father of the petitioner and she further made clear to the father of the petitioner that she should make arrangement for second marriage of the petitioner as she would not return to the matrimonial home. Thus, it was claimed that respondent deserted the appellant-petitioner since March, 1990 without any reasonable cause. Thus, divorce was sought on the ground of cruelty and desertion. The petition was contested by the respondent-wife. In the written statement it was contended that appellant had no locus standi to maintain the petition. Further he was estopped from filing the present petition by his own act and conduct. It was also pleaded that appellant had concealed the true and material facts from the Court. The respondent claimed that the marriage between the parties was arranged through matrimonial column in the newspaper after due verifications and satisfaction regarding the background and status of both the families. The marriage was performed in a traditional form with great pomp and show and sufficient dowry was given by the father of the FAO No. 151-M of 1996 respondent. It was asserted that the marriage between the parties was consummated and the parties cohabited on the first night. The respondent on the next day of the marriage felt that parents of the petitioner were not happy with the dowry given by the parents of the respondent and their behaviour was not good towards the respondent because they started taunting the respondent. After the marriage the appellant-petitioner stayed at Pehowa where they enjoyed all types of family life including physical relation between the two. It was further the case of the respondent that after the petitioner left Pehowa for his place of posting at Dhariwal, behaviour of the family of the petitioner was totally changed and they started misbehaving and insulting her and further declared that they have got no sufficient accommodation to keep the respondent at Pehowa and, therefore, they asked the respondent to bring a sum of Rs. 50,000/- so as to enable them to raise further construction. The respondent pleaded her helplessness which made behaviour of the parents of the appellant-petitioner to the respondent more rude. Brother of the respondent visited Pehowa to see her on 22.11.1989 and it was the parents of the appellant who sent the respondent with her brother and told her that she should not come back at her own and that when the petitioner would come, he will bring her to the matrimonial home. In December, 1989 respondent went to Dhariwal i.e. the place of posting of appellant and stayed with him for ten days. During her stay at Dhariwal appellant assured her that he will try for a family station and would keep the respondent there and asked the respondent to wait for some FAO No. 151-M of 1996 time more. She was left at Pehowa but the parents of the petitioner turned her out from matrimonial home in March, 1990 in three clothes. The respondent claimed that she was ready and willing to go with the appellant and it was the appellant who deserted her on the ground that he was posted in sensitive area and a non-family station. He also gave false assertion that respondent would be kept with him whenever he would be posted at a family station. On merit, it was pleaded that the appellant and respondent lived peaceful and happy life at Dhariwal and that the marriage has been consummated on the first night and further that both the husband and wife had physical relation on different occasion. Thus, it was prayed that the petition be dismissed. In replication, the pleas raised in petition were reiterated and that of written statement were denied. On the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were framed :- . Whether the respondent, after solemnisation of marriage between the parties, treated the petitioner with cruelty. If so its effect ? OPP . Whether the respondent has deserted the petitioner since March, 1990, as alleged. If so its effect ? OPP . Whether the petitioner has no locus- standi to file the claim-petition ? OPR . Whether this Court has got no jurisdiction to maintain and try the petition ?OPR FAO No. 151-M of 1996 . Whether the petitioner is estopped from filing the petition by his own act and conduct ?OPR . Relief. Issues No. 1 & 2 were taken up together. In support of the plea the appellant appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and deposed that he was married with respondent on 8.10.1989 and that after the marriage the respondent was brought at Pehowa. On the first night, the respondent told him that she wanted to marry some other boy of her choice but her father forced her to marry to him. It was asserted that the marriage was not consummated. It was claimed that matter was told to his father 2-3 after the marriage when they went to the father of the respondent, who came to Pehowa and advised the respondent to cooperate with the appellant- petitioner. However, in spite of advice of her father there was no change in her behaviour. He also stated that he went to Dhariwal, his place of posting, after 2-3 days of marriage, where he remained under tension. In the second week of December, 1989 father of respondent dropped her at Dhariwal and thereafter the respondent stayed for 6-7 days in a quarter of his friend situated in the office of the Company. During her stay with him at Dhariwal, she did not attend to his friends and officers whom he invited for dinner. Similarly, she did not attend and join his other colleagues who visited the quarter. Thus, behaviour of respondent resulted in tension. The marriage was also not consummated at Dhariwal in view of the threat of suicide. The respondent was left at Pehowa, from where she went to her parents house at Ambala City. On 20.12.1989 he came to Pehowa on one month's leave and FAO No. 151-M of 1996 the respondent also came there and stayed there for three days. During the vacations of one month, respondent usually came to Pehowa and went back to Ambala. It was also stated that on the first visit to Pehowa during his vacations, the respondent wiped out the 'Sindur' and broke bangles and threatened to commit suicide if he touched her. Even during her stay at Pehowa the marriage was not consummated. It was also stated that the wife used to quarrel with the appellant and his family members, which resulted in great mental and physical torture. The other averments in petition were also reiterated. The appellant-petitioner further examined his father Tej Nath as PW-2, who deposed that after the celebration of the marriage between the parties, the respondent came to Pehowa and 2-3 days thereafter the appellant told him that the respondent had told to the petitioner that the marriage of respondent was performed against her wishes and that the respondent had threatened to commit suicide if he would touch her body. He stated that he went to father of the respondent and told about the incident on which father of the respondent accompanied him to Pehowa and made respondent understand the things. He also stated about the appellant-petitioner went back to place of his posting after six days as he had come on leave for ten days for the performance of marriage. He also deposed with respect to the attitude of the respondent during her stay with them. He also supported the appellant that the respondent wife stayed at Dhariwal for 6-7 days but she was brought back to Pehowa and during her stay at Dhariwal she had repeated the threat of suicide. The appellant went back to Dhariwal whereas FAO No. 151-M of 1996 the respondent-wife left for her parental house at Ambala. He also supported the version of the appellant with regard to the conduct of the respondent during one month's leave of the appellant. PW-3 Surender Sharma, brother-in-law of the appellant, deposed that on 3rd March, 1990, he accompanied by his father-in-law Tej Nath and Pawan Kumar visited the house of respondent at Ambala and discussed the matter with the father of the respondent. It was after persuasion that she was sent to Pehowa but she stayed there for only a period of one week and went back to her parents house. On the other hand, the respondent wife appeared as RW-1 and deposed that after the marriage on 8.10.1999 she went to matrimonial home on 9.10.1989 and thereafter she lived with the petitioner as his wife and they cohabited as husband and wife. Even on 10.10.1989 they cohabited and it was on 11.10.1989 she along with the petitioner and two brothers-in-law of the appellant went to her parents house to perform Phera ceremony but returned to Pehowa on the same day after taking meals and thereafter they cohabited as husband and wife and their relations remained cordial. She asserted her allegation of demand of Rs. 50,000/- by the parents of the appellant for the purpose to construct a room. It was claimed that during her stay at Pehowa the parties remained happy and her father and sister also came at Pehowa on festivals like Diwali and Karva-chauth etc. She claimed to have stayed at Pehowa when her husband was away to duty at Dhariwal. On 22.11.1989 the brother of the respondent came to Pehowa to take her as her sister had delivered a son and on that occasion, she was told by her FAO No. 151-M of 1996 mother-in-law that since there was shortage of accommodation with them, therefore, she should continue to stay at her parents house until her husband comes from the place of his posting. On 10.11.1987 Chander Shekhar, brother-in-law of the petitioner came to Ambala and told that she had been called by the petitioner at Dhariwal. On this she was first taken to Pehowa as her clothes etc. were at Pehowa and then she was taken at Dhariwal on .11.1989. She stayed at Dhariwal for ten days where she claimed that during her stay they lived peacefully and happily. She claimed that the appellant came to Pehowa along with her on one month's leave and then the appellant went to Tripura on training but she remained at Pehowa upto March, 1990. During her stay at Pehowa she wrote letters Ex. R-1to Ex. R-3 to her parents. She further stated that on the suggestion of her father-in-law she wrote a letter to her parents for sending her certificates as her father-in- law had told that he would make efforts for her job. On 15.3.1990, she wrote a letter Ex. R-2 at the instance of her father-in-law and mother-in-law as they wanted to go out of station and she was asked to go to her parents house with some one. Her sister came to Pehowa on 17.3.1990 and she accompanied her to Ambala. It was on that occasion that she was informed by her in-laws that she could be called back when her husband would come to Pehowa. However, thereafter nobody has come to take her to matrimonial home. It is further stated in evidence that her father-in-law had met her sister at her office at Ambala and on that occasion her sister had asked him as to when she would be taken to her matrimonial home but she was informed that the appellant was posted at non-family station and whenever FAO No. 151-M of 1996 he would come he would take the respondent. However, nobody turned to take her nor any message was received. The respondent stated that she was still ready to go to the matrimonial home and live with the appellant. Sukh Versha RW-2, sister of respondent appeared in the witness box and stated that she was posted in the office of Home Guards, Haryana. She stated that she visited Pehowa at the matrimonial home of the respondent on so many occasions and even on the occasion of Phera ceremony. The respondent told her that she was happy at the matrimonial home and that the petitioner was also happy at that time. She only blamed about the behaviour of the mother of the petitioner. On Karva-Chauth, the mother-in-law of respondent did not come to see her. She further stated that when she visited Pehowa she found appellant to be in happy mood and she was even served tea. No complaint was made to her about the behaviour of the respondent. She has stated having gone to Pehowa on receipt of letter Ex.R-2 to bring respondent at Ambala as the parents of the appellant were to go out of station for 3-4 days. However, thereafter nobody turned up to take her back to the matrimonial home. RW-3 Fakir Chand, father of the respondent, appeared in the witness box and supported the version of the respondent on material particulars. RW-4 G.P.S. Grewal deposed that in the year 1991 the parents of the parties had come together to his office at Ambala to know about the place of posting of the appellant and also to make a request that she be taken to matrimonial home. However, the father of the appellant refused to take FAO No. 151-M of 1996 her and even did not tell the particulars of the posting of the appellant. RW-5 Anju Sudan, another sister of the respondent appeared in the witness box to depose that the parties were happy in the matrimonial life. She further claimed that the respondent had told about the consummation of marriage. RW-6 Ramesh Kumar appeared in the witness box and deposed that he had gone to the house of the father of the appellant at Pehowa to give message about the death of uncle of the respondent. The learned matrimonial Court on appreciation of evidence did not accept the version given by the appellant that the respondent has not allowed the consummation of marriage. The Court observed that in case the stand of the appellant was correct there was no occasion for the respondent to have gone to Dhariwal merely after two months of marriage. The Court also did not belive that though the parties stayed together in one room at Chariwal, the marriage was not consummated as untoward incident may not happen. The learned matrimonial Court also observed that threat of suicide seems to be creation of appellant. The evidence, thus, was not believed. The learned Court further observed that the parties lived in Chobara of Vinod Kumar Gupta, friend of the appellant, which is surrounded by other houses. The Court observed that neither Vinod Kumar Gupta nor any other person from the locality was produced to show that the relationship between the parties at Dhariwal were cordial or strained. FAO No. 151-M of 1996 The learned Matrimonial Court did not believe the allegations that the respondent did not attend to his friends for want of corroboration from any other independent evidence. The Court observed that the appellant failed to examine any of his colleagues. The learned Court held that the material witnesses have been withheld by the appellant. The Court also held that as his statement suffered from inherent defect the same could not be believed to come to a conclusion that the respondent treated her with cruelty. The other part of the story of the respondent had claimed on the first night that she wanted to marry to another boy, was also disbelieved. The Court believed the evidence led by the respondent-wife. The Court did not believe the version of the father of the appellant as he had denied the factum of marriage having been performed through advertisement. The Court also observed that the evidence brought on record showed that the respondent and her father made efforts for rehabilitation of the parties. She was further said to have given detailed version that the parties cohabited at Pehowa and then at Dhariwal and also that they lived very happily. The learned Court also discussed the documentary evidence brought on record and, thus, held that the appellant has failed to prove that respondent had treated him with cruelty or that the appellant had deserted the matrimonial home. The issues framed were decided against the appellant and the petition was dismissed. Mr. Jasbir Rattan, learned counsel for the appellant referred to the statement of PW-1 i.e. the appellant to contend that the evidence on record showed that the respondent had not allowed the appellant to FAO No. 151-M of 1996 consumate the marriage and this fact stood further proved from the statement of PW-2, his father and, therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant was that this act of the respondent amounted to cruelty. The learned counsel for the appellant contended that cruelty can be both physical and mental. The learned counsel for the appellant also referred to the statement of PW-2 to contend that the real dispute between the parties was regarding age of Neelam which was wrongly shown less for the matrimonial alliance though she was older than the appellant. He further referred to the statement of other witnesses i.e. PW-3 and PW-4 and contended that the allegations made in the petition stood proved and, therefore, the finding of the learned matrimonial Court deserves to be set aside. He further referred to the statement of RW-1to contend that if the evidence is read in totality it would show that the respondent was not happy with the status of the family of appellant and complained about the shortage of accommodation. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant, therefore, was that if the evidence brought on record is seen in totality it would show that the appellant was treated with cruelty. The learned counsel for the appellant referred to the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh (2) Civil Court cases 663 (S.C.) to contend that no uniform standard can ever be laid down which may prove mental cruelty. It is the totality of the circumstances and evidence brought on record that a view can be formed whether the person is treated with mental cruelty or not. The Hon'ble FAO No. 151-M of 1996 Supreme Court in the case of Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh (supra) has been pleased to lay down as under :- 85. No uniform standard can even be laid down for guidance, yet we deem it appropriate to enumerate some instances of human behaviour which may be relevant in dealing with the case of 'mental cruelty'. The instances indicated in the succeeding paragraphs are only illustrative and not exhaustive. (i) On consideration of complete matrimonial life of the parties, acute mental pain, agony and suffering as would not make possible for the parties to live with each other could come with the broad parameters of mental cruelty. (ii) On comprehensive appraisal of the entire matrimonial life of the parties, it becomes abundantly clear that situation is such that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and continue to live with other party. (iii) Mere coldness or lack of affection cannot amount to cruelty, frequent rudeness of language, petulance of matter, indifference and neglect may reach such a decree that it makes the material life for the other spouse absolutely intolerable. (iv) Mental cruelty is a state of mind. The feeling of deep anguish, disappointment, frustration in one spouse caused by the conduct of other for a long time may lead to mental cruelty. FAO No. 151-M of 1996 (v) A sustained course of abusive and humiliating treatment calculated to torture, discommode or render miserable life of the spouse. (vi) Sustained unjustifiable conduct and behaviour of one spouse actually affecting physical and mental health of the other spouse. The treatment complained of and the resultant danger or apprehension must be very grave, substantial and weighty. (vii) Sustained reprehensible conduct, studied neglect, indifference or total departure from the normal standard of conjugal kindness causing injury to mental health or deriving sadistic pleasure can also amount to mental cruelty. (viii) The conduct must be much more than jealousy, selfishness, possessiveness, which causes unhappiness and dissatisfaction and emotional upset may not be a ground for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty. (ix) Mere trivial irritations, quarrels, normal wear and tear of the married life which happens in day to day life would not be adequate for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty. (x) The married life should be reviewed as a whole and a few isolated instances over a period of years will not amount to cruelty. The ill- conduct must be persistent for a fairly lengthy period, where the relationship has deteriorated to an extent that because of the acts and behaviour FAO No. 151-M of 1996 of a spouse, the wronged party finds it extremely difficult to live with the other party any longer, may amount to mental cruelty. (xi) If a husband submits himself for an operation of sterilization without medical reasons and without the consent or knowledge of his wife and similarly if the wife undergoes vasectomy or abortion without medical reason or without the consent or knowledge of her husband, such an act of the spouse may lead to mental cruelty. (xii) Unilateral decision of refusal to have intercourse for considerable period without there being any physical incapacity or valid reason may amount to mental cruelty. (xiii) Unilateral decision of either husband or wife after marriage not to have child from the marriage may amount to cruelty. (xiv) Where there has been a long period of continuous separation, it may fairly be concluded that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair. The marriage becomes a fiction though supported by a legal tie. By refusing to sever that tie, the law in such cases, does not serve the sanctity of marriage; on the contrary, it shows scant regard for the feelings and emotions of the parties. In such like situations, it may lead to mental cruelty. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant, therefore, was that admittedly there has been long period of continuous separation and, therefore, it could be presumed that the matrimonial bond is FAO No. 151-M of 1996 beyond repair. The marriage, therefore, is merely fiction though supported by a legal tie and refusal to grant divorce does serve the sanctity of marriage but on the contrary leads to mental cruelty. The learned counsel for the appellant thereafter placed reliance on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satish Sitole Vs. Ganga AIR 2008 SC 3093 to contend that even if the husband has been unable to make out a ground for divorce but the facts show that the parties have been living separately for long period by making acrimonious allegations against each other then continuance of such marriage would itself amount to cruelty. In such situation the party would be entitle to divorce with adequate provision of alimony. The reliance was placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Naveen Kohli Vs. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) Civil Court cases 226 (S.C.) to contend that irretrievable breakdown of marriage has been recommended to be a ground for divorce. He also contends that it is not only the physical violence but conduct of spouse can also cause mental cruelty and torture. Mr. Kanwaljit Singh, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent supported the judgment and decree passed by the learned matrimonial Court primarily on the ground that the appellant cannot be allowed to take benefit of his own wrong. The contention of the learned senior counsel for the respondent was that the respondent has always been willing to accompany the appellant. He further referred to the documentary evidence placed on record by way of letters to contend that the respondent has been happily living in matrimonial home and it was the appellant and FAO No. 151-M of 1996 his family members who did not want to keep her in matrimonial home. It is the contention that she has even not taken her dowry articles and Istri Dhan, which is still with the appellant. The learned counsel for the respondent contended that the allegations levelled about the non-consummation of marriage are false and have been specifically denied by the respondent and there is no reason, whatsoever, to disbelieve her statement. It is also the contention of the learned senior counsel for the respondent that finding of fact has been recorded by the learned matrimonial Court on appreciation of evidence. The learned counsel for the respondent further contended that the ground of act of cruelty are to be distinguished from ordinary wear and tear of family. The contention of the learned counsel for the respondent is that even if the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant believed to be true, cannot be said to be an act of cruelty. In support of his contention reliance was placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Savitri Pandey Vs. Prem Chandra Pandey AIR 2002 Supreme Court 591. The learned senior counsel for the respondent also referred to the judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of Narinder Singh Vs. Rekha @ Pushpa 2007(5) RCR (Civil) 727 to contend that wife refusing to serve tea to friends of her husband and family members, is no ground to seek divorce on the ground of cruelty. The learned senior counsel for the respondent finally referred to the judgment of this Court in the case of Gurdeep Singh alias Tota Singh FAO No. 151-M of 1996 Vs. Jaspal Kaur 2009(1)RCR (Civil) 593 to contend that irretrievable marriage is not a ground for grant of divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act. On consideration of the matter, I find no force in the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellant. The judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satish Sitole Vs. Ganga (supra) is in exercise of Article 142 of the Constitution of India on the facts and circumstances of that particular case, therefore, it cannot be binding precedent to decide matrimonial cases. The appellant in view of the findings recorded by the learned matrimonial Court as also evidence brought on record has failed to prove cruelty or desertion. He cannot be allowed to take benefit of his own wrong in not settling respondent in matrimonial home. To claim divorce merely on the ground that the parties have been separately living for number of years cannot be a ground for divorce. The findings of the learned matrimonial Court do not call for any interference by this Court in this appeal. Dismissed with no order as to costs. February 24, 2009 ( VINOD K. SHARMA ) 'sp' JUDGE",

Appellant\nVersus\nNeelam \n...... Respondent\nCORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VINOD K. SHARMA\nPresent :\nMr. Jasbir Rattan, Advocate\nfor the appellant.\nMr. Kanwaljit Singh, Sr. Advocate with \nMr. Harmanjit Singh, Advocate\nfor the respondent.\n****\nVINOD K. SHARMA, J. \nAppellant-husband by way of the present appeal has challenged\nthe judgment and decree passed by the learned Addl. District Judge,\nKurukshetra dismissing his petition under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage\nAct.\nAppellant-petitioner filed a petition under Section 13 of the\nHindu Marriage Act for dissolution of marriage by decree of divorce on the\nplea that the marriage between the parties was performed on 8.10.1989\naccording to Hindu rites and ceremonies at Ambala City.\nAfter the marriage the parties resided at Pehowa, District\nKurukshetra but the marriage was not consummated and, thus, no child was\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nborn out of the wedlock. On the first night the respondent wife declared to\nthe petitioner that her marriage with the petitioner was performed against\nher wishes and on account of threat of her father of committing suicide in\ncase of her refusal to marry the appellant-petitioner.\nIt was also the case set up by the appellant-husband that\nrespondent-wife claimed that she had waited for more than 40 years to\nmarry a boy of her choice but her desire has not been fulfilled and,\ntherefore, she would not permit the petitioner to consumate the marriage. \nAppellant further claimed that respondent did not resume\ncohabitation with the appellant-petitioner. The appellant did not disclose\nthis fact to his parents on the next morning and rather tried to persuade the\nrespondent so that she should not create tensions and problem, and should\nbehave liken an Indian lady and to forget her past life. The respondent wife\ninstead of mending herself, became arrogant, harsh and cruel to the\npetitioner as well as his family members. Thereafter father of the respondent\nwas called and everything was made clear to him but nothing tangible came\nout. The appellant-petitioner was posted at Dhariwal, as an Inspector in\nBorder Security Force, which was terrorist affected area and, therefore, he\nwas granted one week's leave for the marriage and he on expiry of leave\nwent back to his duty at Dhariwal. It is case of the appellant that the\nmarriage was never consummated.\nThe respondent left the matrimonial home and went to her\nparents house at Ambala City. It was only on persuasion of father of the\npetitioner and other relations, who visited the house of respondent at\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nAmbala City, it was decided that the petitioner should keep the respondent\nat Dhariwal for a week and accordingly in the month of December, 1989\nrespondent went to Dhariwal where the petitioner was posted. The\nappellant-petitioner made arrangement for her stay in a house of some one\nbut during her stay at Dhariwal also, the behaviour of the respondent\nremained the same. It is also allegation of the appellant-petitioner that he\ninvited some officers of the B.S.F. to celebrate but respondent refused to\nattend the celebration which was a very humiliating for the appellant.\nIt is also the allegation that when appellant invited some of his\ncolleagues the respondent refused to join them and slept in a room\ncomplaining of headache and this cruel act of the respondent forced the\npetitioner to spend sleepless nights. Even during her stay at Dhariwal she\ndid not permit the appellant-petitioner to consummate the marriage as\nrespondent gave threat that she would commit suicide if she was forced to\nlive with him. Only after a week respondent forced him to drop her at\nAmbala City.\nThe appellant claimed that on persuasion of his parents he took\none month's leave for the period 20.12.1989 to 20.1.1990 when father of the\nrespondent brought her to Pehowa and advised the respondent to live like a\npious lady but all in vain. On the first night during their stay at Pehowa\nduring the vacations, the respondent wife wiped out her 'Sindoor' and 'Bindi'\naffixed on her forehead and broke all the bangles with a threat that ties of\nthe marriage with the appellant-petitioner had been broken. The respondent\ndid not allow the petitioner to touch her body with the same threat of\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\ncommitting suicide. In view of the allegations made above, it was pleaded\nthat the life of the appellant was turned into hell. The respondent stayed at\nPehowa only for ten days during the leave of one month. He again reported\nfor his duty on 20.1.1990.\nThe respondent-thereafter was again brought to Pehowa after a\ngreat persuasion by the father of the petitioner with the help of a Panchayat\nconsisting of Durga Dass, Pawan Kumar and Surender Pal but the\nrespondent again left the matrimonial home in the month of March, 1990\nwithout permission of the father of the petitioner and she further made clear\nto the father of the petitioner that she should make arrangement for second\nmarriage of the petitioner as she would not return to the matrimonial home.\nThus, it was claimed that respondent deserted the appellant-petitioner since\nMarch, 1990 without any reasonable cause. Thus, divorce was sought on the\nground of cruelty and desertion.\nThe petition was contested by the respondent-wife. In the\nwritten statement it was contended that appellant had no locus standi to\nmaintain the petition. Further he was estopped from filing the present\npetition by his own act and conduct. It was also pleaded that appellant had\nconcealed the true and material facts from the Court.\nThe respondent claimed that the marriage between the parties\nwas arranged through matrimonial column in the newspaper after due\nverifications and satisfaction regarding the background and status of both\nthe families. The marriage was performed in a traditional form with great\npomp and show and sufficient dowry was given by the father of the\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nrespondent. It was asserted that the marriage between the parties was\nconsummated and the parties cohabited on the first night. The respondent on\nthe next day of the marriage felt that parents of the petitioner were not\nhappy with the dowry given by the parents of the respondent and their\nbehaviour was not good towards the respondent because they started\ntaunting the respondent.\nAfter the marriage the appellant-petitioner stayed at Pehowa\nwhere they enjoyed all types of family life including physical relation\nbetween the two. It was further the case of the respondent that after the\npetitioner left Pehowa for his place of posting at Dhariwal, behaviour of the\nfamily of the petitioner was totally changed and they started misbehaving\nand insulting her and further declared that they have got no sufficient\naccommodation to keep the respondent at Pehowa and, therefore, they asked\nthe respondent to bring a sum of Rs. 50,000/- so as to enable them to raise\nfurther construction. The respondent pleaded her helplessness which made\nbehaviour of the parents of the appellant-petitioner to the respondent more\nrude. Brother of the respondent visited Pehowa to see her on 22.11.1989\nand it was the parents of the appellant who sent the respondent with her\nbrother and told her that she should not come back at her own and that when\nthe petitioner would come, he will bring her to the matrimonial home.\nIn December, 1989 respondent went to Dhariwal i.e. the place\nof posting of appellant and stayed with him for ten days. During her stay at\nDhariwal appellant assured her that he will try for a family station and\nwould keep the respondent there and asked the respondent to wait for some\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\ntime more. She was left at Pehowa but the parents of the petitioner turned\nher out from matrimonial home in March, 1990 in three clothes.\nThe respondent claimed that she was ready and willing to go\nwith the appellant and it was the appellant who deserted her on the ground\nthat he was posted in sensitive area and a non-family station. He also gave\nfalse assertion that respondent would be kept with him whenever he would\nbe posted at a family station. \nOn merit, it was pleaded that the appellant and respondent lived\npeaceful and happy life at Dhariwal and that the marriage has been\nconsummated on the first night and further that both the husband and wife\nhad physical relation on different occasion. Thus, it was prayed that the\npetition be dismissed.\nIn replication, the pleas raised in petition were reiterated and\nthat of written statement were denied.\nOn the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were\nframed :-\n.\nWhether the respondent, after solemnisation\nof marriage between the parties, treated the\npetitioner with cruelty. If so its effect ? OPP \n.\nWhether the respondent has deserted the\npetitioner since March, 1990, as alleged. If so\nits effect ? OPP \n.\nWhether the petitioner has no locus- standi to\nfile the claim-petition ? OPR\n.\nWhether this Court has got no jurisdiction to\nmaintain and try the petition ?OPR \nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\n.\nWhether the petitioner is estopped from filing\nthe petition by his own act and conduct ?OPR\n.\nRelief. \nIssues No. 1 & 2 were taken up together. In support of the plea\nthe appellant appeared in the witness box as PW-1 and deposed that he was\nmarried with respondent on 8.10.1989 and that after the marriage the\nrespondent was brought at Pehowa. On the first night, the respondent told\nhim that she wanted to marry some other boy of her choice but her father\nforced her to marry to him. It was asserted that the marriage was not\nconsummated. It was claimed that matter was told to his father 2-3 after the\nmarriage when they went to the father of the respondent, who came to\nPehowa and advised the respondent to cooperate with the appellant-\npetitioner. However, in spite of advice of her father there was no change in\nher behaviour. He also stated that he went to Dhariwal, his place of posting,\nafter 2-3 days of marriage, where he remained under tension. In the second\nweek of December, 1989 father of respondent dropped her at Dhariwal and\nthereafter the respondent stayed for 6-7 days in a quarter of his friend\nsituated in the office of the Company. During her stay with him at Dhariwal,\nshe did not attend to his friends and officers whom he invited for dinner.\nSimilarly, she did not attend and join his other colleagues who visited the\nquarter. Thus, behaviour of respondent resulted in tension. The marriage\nwas also not consummated at Dhariwal in view of the threat of suicide. The\nrespondent was left at Pehowa, from where she went to her parents house at\nAmbala City. On 20.12.1989 he came to Pehowa on one month's leave and\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nthe respondent also came there and stayed there for three days. During the\nvacations of one month, respondent usually came to Pehowa and went back\nto Ambala. It was also stated that on the first visit to Pehowa during his\nvacations, the respondent wiped out the 'Sindur' and broke bangles and\nthreatened to commit suicide if he touched her. Even during her stay at\nPehowa the marriage was not consummated. It was also stated that the wife\nused to quarrel with the appellant and his family members, which resulted in\ngreat mental and physical torture. The other averments in petition were also\nreiterated.\nThe appellant-petitioner further examined his father Tej Nath as\nPW-2, who deposed that after the celebration of the marriage between the\nparties, the respondent came to Pehowa and 2-3 days thereafter the appellant\ntold him that the respondent had told to the petitioner that the marriage of\nrespondent was performed against her wishes and that the respondent had\nthreatened to commit suicide if he would touch her body. He stated that he\nwent to father of the respondent and told about the incident on which father\nof the respondent accompanied him to Pehowa and made respondent\nunderstand the things. He also stated about the appellant-petitioner went\nback to place of his posting after six days as he had come on leave for ten\ndays for the performance of marriage. He also deposed with respect to the\nattitude of the respondent during her stay with them. He also supported the\nappellant that the respondent wife stayed at Dhariwal for 6-7 days but she\nwas brought back to Pehowa and during her stay at Dhariwal she had\nrepeated the threat of suicide. The appellant went back to Dhariwal whereas\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nthe respondent-wife left for her parental house at Ambala. He also supported\nthe version of the appellant with regard to the conduct of the respondent\nduring one month's leave of the appellant.\nPW-3 Surender Sharma, brother-in-law of the appellant,\ndeposed that on 3rd March, 1990, he accompanied by his father-in-law Tej\nNath and Pawan Kumar visited the house of respondent at Ambala and\ndiscussed the matter with the father of the respondent. It was after\npersuasion that she was sent to Pehowa but she stayed there for only a\nperiod of one week and went back to her parents house.\nOn the other hand, the respondent wife appeared as RW-1 and\ndeposed that after the marriage on 8.10.1999 she went to matrimonial home\non 9.10.1989 and thereafter she lived with the petitioner as his wife and they\ncohabited as husband and wife. Even on 10.10.1989 they cohabited and it\nwas on 11.10.1989 she along with the petitioner and two brothers-in-law of\nthe appellant went to her parents house to perform Phera ceremony but\nreturned to Pehowa on the same day after taking meals and thereafter they\ncohabited as husband and wife and their relations remained cordial. She\nasserted her allegation of demand of Rs. 50,000/- by the parents of the\nappellant for the purpose to construct a room. It was claimed that during her\nstay at Pehowa the parties remained happy and her father and sister also\ncame at Pehowa on festivals like Diwali and Karva-chauth etc. She claimed\nto have stayed at Pehowa when her husband was away to duty at Dhariwal.\nOn 22.11.1989 the brother of the respondent came to Pehowa to take her as\nher sister had delivered a son and on that occasion, she was told by her\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nmother-in-law that since there was shortage of accommodation with them,\ntherefore, she should continue to stay at her parents house until her husband\ncomes from the place of his posting. On 10.11.1987 Chander Shekhar,\nbrother-in-law of the petitioner came to Ambala and told that she had been\ncalled by the petitioner at Dhariwal. On this she was first taken to Pehowa\nas her clothes etc. were at Pehowa and then she was taken at Dhariwal on\n.11.1989. She stayed at Dhariwal for ten days where she claimed that\nduring her stay they lived peacefully and happily. She claimed that the\nappellant came to Pehowa along with her on one month's leave and then the\nappellant went to Tripura on training but she remained at Pehowa upto\nMarch, 1990. During her stay at Pehowa she wrote letters Ex. R-1to Ex. R-3\nto her parents. She further stated that on the suggestion of her father-in-law\nshe wrote a letter to her parents for sending her certificates as her father-in-\nlaw had told that he would make efforts for her job. On 15.3.1990, she\nwrote a letter Ex. R-2 at the instance of her father-in-law and mother-in-law\nas they wanted to go out of station and she was asked to go to her parents\nhouse with some one. Her sister came to Pehowa on 17.3.1990 and she\naccompanied her to Ambala. It was on that occasion that she was informed\nby her in-laws that she could be called back when her husband would come\nto Pehowa. However, thereafter nobody has come to take her to matrimonial\nhome. It is further stated in evidence that her father-in-law had met her\nsister at her office at Ambala and on that occasion her sister had asked him\nas to when she would be taken to her matrimonial home but she was\ninformed that the appellant was posted at non-family station and whenever\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nhe would come he would take the respondent. However, nobody turned to\ntake her nor any message was received. The respondent stated that she was\nstill ready to go to the matrimonial home and live with the appellant.\nSukh Versha RW-2, sister of respondent appeared in the\nwitness box and stated that she was posted in the office of Home Guards,\nHaryana. She stated that she visited Pehowa at the matrimonial home of the\nrespondent on so many occasions and even on the occasion of Phera\nceremony. The respondent told her that she was happy at the matrimonial\nhome and that the petitioner was also happy at that time. She only blamed\nabout the behaviour of the mother of the petitioner. On Karva-Chauth, the\nmother-in-law of respondent did not come to see her. She further stated that\nwhen she visited Pehowa she found appellant to be in happy mood and she\nwas even served tea. No complaint was made to her about the behaviour of\nthe respondent. She has stated having gone to Pehowa on receipt of letter\nEx.R-2 to bring respondent at Ambala as the parents of the appellant were to\ngo out of station for 3-4 days. However, thereafter nobody turned up to take\nher back to the matrimonial home.\nRW-3 Fakir Chand, father of the respondent, appeared in the\nwitness box and supported the version of the respondent on material\nparticulars.\nRW-4 G.P.S. Grewal deposed that in the year 1991 the parents\nof the parties had come together to his office at Ambala to know about the\nplace of posting of the appellant and also to make a request that she be taken\nto matrimonial home. However, the father of the appellant refused to take\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nher and even did not tell the particulars of the posting of the appellant.\nRW-5 Anju Sudan, another sister of the respondent appeared in\nthe witness box to depose that the parties were happy in the matrimonial\nlife. She further claimed that the respondent had told about the\nconsummation of marriage. \nRW-6 Ramesh Kumar appeared in the witness box and deposed\nthat he had gone to the house of the father of the appellant at Pehowa to\ngive message about the death of uncle of the respondent.\nThe learned matrimonial Court on appreciation of evidence did\nnot accept the version given by the appellant that the respondent has not\nallowed the consummation of marriage. The Court observed that in case the\nstand of the appellant was correct there was no occasion for the respondent\nto have gone to Dhariwal merely after two months of marriage. The Court\nalso did not belive that though the parties stayed together in one room at\nChariwal, the marriage was not consummated as untoward incident may not\nhappen.\nThe learned matrimonial Court also observed that threat of\nsuicide seems to be creation of appellant. The evidence, thus, was not\nbelieved.\nThe learned Court further observed that the parties lived in\nChobara of Vinod Kumar Gupta, friend of the appellant, which is\nsurrounded by other houses. The Court observed that neither Vinod Kumar\nGupta nor any other person from the locality was produced to show that the\nrelationship between the parties at Dhariwal were cordial or strained.\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nThe learned Matrimonial Court did not believe the allegations\nthat the respondent did not attend to his friends for want of corroboration\nfrom any other independent evidence. The Court observed that the appellant\nfailed to examine any of his colleagues. The learned Court held that the\nmaterial witnesses have been withheld by the appellant. The Court also held\nthat as his statement suffered from inherent defect the same could not be\nbelieved to come to a conclusion that the respondent treated her with\ncruelty. The other part of the story of the respondent had claimed on the first\nnight that she wanted to marry to another boy, was also disbelieved. The\nCourt believed the evidence led by the respondent-wife. The Court did not\nbelieve the version of the father of the appellant as he had denied the factum\nof marriage having been performed through advertisement. The Court also\nobserved that the evidence brought on record showed that the respondent\nand her father made efforts for rehabilitation of the parties. She was further\nsaid to have given detailed version that the parties cohabited at Pehowa and\nthen at Dhariwal and also that they lived very happily.\nThe learned Court also discussed the documentary evidence\nbrought on record and, thus, held that the appellant has failed to prove that\nrespondent had treated him with cruelty or that the appellant had deserted\nthe matrimonial home. The issues framed were decided against the appellant\nand the petition was dismissed.\nMr. Jasbir Rattan, learned counsel for the appellant referred to\nthe statement of PW-1 i.e. the appellant to contend that the evidence on\nrecord showed that the respondent had not allowed the appellant to\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nconsumate the marriage and this fact stood further proved from the\nstatement of PW-2, his father and, therefore, the contention of the learned\ncounsel for the appellant was that this act of the respondent amounted to\ncruelty.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant contended that cruelty\ncan be both physical and mental. The learned counsel for the appellant also\nreferred to the statement of PW-2 to contend that the real dispute between\nthe parties was regarding age of Neelam which was wrongly shown less for\nthe matrimonial alliance though she was older than the appellant. He further\nreferred to the statement of other witnesses i.e. PW-3 and PW-4 and\ncontended that the allegations made in the petition stood proved and,\ntherefore, the finding of the learned matrimonial Court deserves to be set\naside. He further referred to the statement of RW-1to contend that if the\nevidence is read in totality it would show that the respondent was not happy\nwith the status of the family of appellant and complained about the shortage\nof accommodation. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant,\ntherefore, was that if the evidence brought on record is seen in totality it\nwould show that the appellant was treated with cruelty.\nThe learned counsel for the appellant referred to the judgment\nof Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh\n(2) Civil Court cases 663 (S.C.) to contend that no uniform standard\ncan ever be laid down which may prove mental cruelty. It is the totality of\nthe circumstances and evidence brought on record that a view can be formed\nwhether the person is treated with mental cruelty or not. The Hon'ble\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nSupreme Court in the case of Samar Ghosh Vs. Jaya Ghosh (supra) has\nbeen pleased to lay down as under :-\n 85.\nNo uniform standard can even be laid down for\nguidance, yet we deem it appropriate to enumerate some\ninstances of human behaviour which may be relevant in\ndealing with the case of 'mental cruelty'. The instances\nindicated in the succeeding paragraphs are only\nillustrative and not exhaustive.\n(i) On consideration of complete\nmatrimonial life of the parties, acute mental pain,\nagony and suffering as would not make possible\nfor the parties to live with each other could come\nwith the broad parameters of mental cruelty.\n(ii) On comprehensive appraisal of the\nentire matrimonial life of the parties, it becomes\nabundantly clear that situation is such that the\nwronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put\nup with such conduct and continue to live with\nother party.\n(iii)\nMere coldness or lack of affection\ncannot amount to cruelty, frequent rudeness of\nlanguage, petulance of matter, indifference and\nneglect may reach such a decree that it makes the\nmaterial life for the other spouse absolutely\nintolerable.\n(iv)\nMental cruelty is a state of mind. The\nfeeling of deep anguish, disappointment,\nfrustration in one spouse caused by the conduct of\nother for a long time may lead to mental cruelty.\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\n(v)\nA sustained course of abusive and\nhumiliating treatment calculated to torture,\ndiscommode or render miserable life of the\nspouse.\n(vi)\nSustained unjustifiable conduct and\nbehaviour of one spouse actually affecting\nphysical and mental health of the other spouse.\nThe treatment complained of and the resultant\ndanger or apprehension must be very grave,\nsubstantial and weighty.\n(vii)\nSustained reprehensible conduct,\nstudied neglect, indifference or total departure\nfrom the normal standard of conjugal kindness\ncausing injury to mental health or deriving\nsadistic pleasure can also amount to mental\ncruelty.\n(viii) The conduct must be much more than\njealousy, selfishness, possessiveness, which\ncauses unhappiness and dissatisfaction and\nemotional upset may not be a ground for grant of\ndivorce on the ground of mental cruelty.\n(ix)\nMere trivial irritations, quarrels,\nnormal wear and tear of the married life which\nhappens in day to day life would not be adequate\nfor grant of divorce on the ground of mental\ncruelty.\n(x)\nThe married life should be reviewed\nas a whole and a few isolated instances over a\nperiod of years will not amount to cruelty. The ill-\nconduct must be persistent for a fairly lengthy\nperiod, where the relationship has deteriorated to\nan extent that because of the acts and behaviour\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nof a spouse, the wronged party finds it extremely\ndifficult to live with the other party any longer,\nmay amount to mental cruelty.\n(xi)\nIf a husband submits himself for an\noperation of sterilization without medical reasons\nand without the consent or knowledge of his wife\nand similarly if the wife undergoes vasectomy or\nabortion without medical reason or without the\nconsent or knowledge of her husband, such an act\nof the spouse may lead to mental cruelty.\n(xii)\nUnilateral decision of refusal to have\nintercourse for considerable period without there\nbeing any physical incapacity or valid reason may\namount to mental cruelty.\n(xiii) Unilateral decision of either husband\nor wife after marriage not to have child from the\nmarriage may amount to cruelty.\n(xiv) Where there has been a long period\nof continuous separation, it may fairly be\nconcluded that the matrimonial bond is beyond\nrepair. The marriage becomes a fiction though\nsupported by a legal tie. By refusing to sever that\ntie, the law in such cases, does not serve the\nsanctity of marriage; on the contrary, it shows\nscant regard for the feelings and emotions of the\nparties. In such like situations, it may lead to\nmental cruelty. \nThe contention of the learned counsel for the appellant,\ntherefore, was that admittedly there has been long period of continuous\nseparation and, therefore, it could be presumed that the matrimonial bond is\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nbeyond repair. The marriage, therefore, is merely fiction though supported\nby a legal tie and refusal to grant divorce does serve the sanctity of marriage\nbut on the contrary leads to mental cruelty. \nThe learned counsel for the appellant thereafter placed reliance\non the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satish Sitole\nVs. Ganga AIR 2008 SC 3093 to contend that even if the husband has been\nunable to make out a ground for divorce but the facts show that the parties\nhave been living separately for long period by making acrimonious\nallegations against each other then continuance of such marriage would\nitself amount to cruelty. In such situation the party would be entitle to\ndivorce with adequate provision of alimony. The reliance was placed on the\njudgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Naveen Kohli Vs.\nNeelu Kohli 2006(2) Civil Court cases 226 (S.C.) to contend that\nirretrievable breakdown of marriage has been recommended to be a ground\nfor divorce. He also contends that it is not only the physical violence but\nconduct of spouse can also cause mental cruelty and torture. \n Mr. Kanwaljit Singh, learned senior counsel appearing on\nbehalf of the respondent supported the judgment and decree passed by the\nlearned matrimonial Court primarily on the ground that the appellant cannot\nbe allowed to take benefit of his own wrong. The contention of the learned\nsenior counsel for the respondent was that the respondent has always been\nwilling to accompany the appellant. He further referred to the documentary\nevidence placed on record by way of letters to contend that the respondent\nhas been happily living in matrimonial home and it was the appellant and\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nhis family members who did not want to keep her in matrimonial home. It is\nthe contention that she has even not taken her dowry articles and Istri Dhan,\nwhich is still with the appellant.\nThe learned counsel for the respondent contended that the\nallegations levelled about the non-consummation of marriage are false and\nhave been specifically denied by the respondent and there is no reason,\nwhatsoever, to disbelieve her statement. It is also the contention of the\nlearned senior counsel for the respondent that finding of fact has been\nrecorded by the learned matrimonial Court on appreciation of evidence.\nThe learned counsel for the respondent further contended that\nthe ground of act of cruelty are to be distinguished from ordinary wear and\ntear of family. The contention of the learned counsel for the respondent is\nthat even if the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant believed\nto be true, cannot be said to be an act of cruelty. In support of his contention\nreliance was placed on the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the\ncase of Savitri Pandey Vs. Prem Chandra Pandey AIR 2002 Supreme\nCourt 591.\n The learned senior counsel for the respondent also referred to\nthe judgment of the Delhi High Court in the case of Narinder Singh Vs.\nRekha @ Pushpa 2007(5) RCR (Civil) 727 to contend that wife refusing to\nserve tea to friends of her husband and family members, is no ground to\nseek divorce on the ground of cruelty.\nThe learned senior counsel for the respondent finally referred to\nthe judgment of this Court in the case of Gurdeep Singh alias Tota Singh\nFAO No. 151-M of 1996\nVs. Jaspal Kaur 2009(1)RCR (Civil) 593 to contend that irretrievable\nmarriage is not a ground for grant of divorce under Section 13 of the Hindu\nMarriage Act.\nOn consideration of the matter, I find no force in the\ncontentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellant. The judgment of\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Satish Sitole Vs. Ganga (supra)\nis in exercise of Article 142 of the Constitution of India on the facts and\ncircumstances of that particular case, therefore, it cannot be binding\nprecedent to decide matrimonial cases. The appellant in view of the findings\nrecorded by the learned matrimonial Court as also evidence brought on\nrecord has failed to prove cruelty or desertion. He cannot be allowed to take\nbenefit of his own wrong in not settling respondent in matrimonial home.\nTo claim divorce merely on the ground that the parties have been separately\nliving for number of years cannot be a ground for divorce. The findings of\nthe learned matrimonial Court do not call for any interference by this Court\nin this appeal.\nDismissed with no order as to costs.\nFebruary 24, 2009\n\n ( VINOD K. SHARMA )\n 'sp'\n JUDGE"

(ORAL)\nCWP No.7958 of 1988\n.\nThe petitioner seeks for allotment of a plot in his capacity as a\nlocally displaced person, he having suffered loss of property by acquisition\nCWP No.7958 of 1988\n-2-\nunder Punjab Town Improvement Act of 1922. The claim of the petitioner is\nthat as a displaced person, he was entitled to be offered an alternative plot\nof a similar size. The property which he had lost in acquisition was 300 sq.\nyds and he had applied for an allotment to the Chairman of the\nImprovement Trust in the year 1987 and he had also made a payment of\nRs.500/- as earnest money on 25.8.1987. The grievance of the petitioner is\nthat although his brother and sister, who had similarly lost property, had\nbeen favoured with allotment of plots, the same had been denied to him.\n.\nThe writ petition, therefore, came to be filed seeking for a\nissuance of writ of mandamus for allotment of a plot which had been\noriginally allotted to him by the Chairman, Improvement Trust, Ludhiana\nwith the boundaries mentioned in the proceedings.\n.\nThe objection on behalf of the Improvement Trust was that the\nnotification for acquisition had been made on 8.7.1973 under Section 36 of\nthe Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922 and the acquisition was made on\n.5.1975 as per Section 42 and award has been passed on 1.8.1975. It is\na submission on behalf of the respondent that the petitioner had not made\nany application for allotment all the years till the year 1987 but the Chairman\nof the Improvement Trust had no authority to make allotment without\nconfirmation by the Trust. The further objection was that the Chairman had\nno power to allot a commercial plot and the Rules that were applicable,\nwhen he moved an application in the year 1987, was only the Punjab Town\nImprovement (Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots ) Rules 1983. The\nRules, apart from setting out the definition of locally displaced person\nset out how the allotment in respect of the displaced persons having a joint\nkatha, being co-sharers, could be allotted only for one plot taking into\naccount the whole of joint land acquired and further that the allotment could\nbe made under Rule 11, only to persons who had applied for allotment\nwithin a period of three months from the date of the commencement of the\nCWP No.7958 of 1988\n-3-\nRules. Such allotment would again be available only to persons, who\nowned more than half an acre of property, which was lost in the acquisition.\n.\nThe first point for consideration would be the relevant rule that\nwould be applicable. It could be noticed that there were at different times,\nthree types of Rules, one Ludhiana Improvement Trust Land Disposal\nRules, 1964; subsequently, Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots by\nImprovement Trust Rules, 1975 till it was replaced by Punjab Town\nImprovement (Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots ) Rules, 1983. The\napplicability of the relevant rule has been dealt with in several decisions of\nthis Hon'ble Court and particularly the matter was considered in\nSmt.Sushma Palta and others Vs. State of Punjab and others reported\nin 2006 (4) RCR (Civil) 223, where a Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court\nwas considering the applicability of the Rule, in relation to the definition of a\nlocally displaced person. Adverting to a situation that the acquisition had\ntaken place prior to 1975, the Division Bench held that the definition that\nwould govern, cannot be the 1975 Rules but only the Rules of the year 1951\nwould be applicable. This issue came up again in yet another case which\nwas disposed in second appeal in Kulwinder Singh Vs. Improvement\nTrust, Ludhiana, in SA No.2699 of 1997, where the Court held that an\nadvertisement which has been issued in the year 1974 before the actual\nacqusition would not be sufficient compliance of the Rules of the year 1964,\nsince the publication was to be effected in a particular manner after the\nacquisition is made and therefore, any advertisement issued even prior to\nthe date of acquisition cannot fetter the right of the individual to apply for an\nallotment without reference to the date stipulated in the 1974 advertisement.\nJudgment of this Court was also confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nImprovement Trust, Ludhiana Vs. Kulwinder Singh in Civil Appeal\nNo.1487 of 2003. Gurdev Kaur Vs. State of Punjab and another in CWP\nNo.17248 of 1999, again addressed the issue of allotment of a plot under\nCWP No.7958 of 1988\n-4-\nLudhiana Improvement Trust Land Disposal Rules 1964, when the Court by\napplication of the 1964 Rules directed the competent authority to pass an\norder of allotment of a suitable residential plot in a scheme area. The\ndecision in Gurmukh Singh Vs. State of Punjab and others in CWP\nNo.4242 of 1985, which the learned counsel for the respondent was fair to\ncite is the last judgment in the string of decision that considers the relevant\nrules that would be applicable and the manner of fixation of price. Referring\nto an acquisition of property and allotment of land to a locally displaced\nperson prior to 1975, the learned single Judge held that the 1964 Rules\nwould govern the right of the parties and the property could be allotted to\nhim, if he is found eligible for such allotment at a rate at which the trust had\nlastly sold any residential plot in the development scheme. The entitlement\nunder the 1964 Rules are set out through Section 2(b).\n.\nIn this case, the allotment by the Chairman of the Board is\nattacked on the ground that the property was not even specifically described\nwith reference to the khalta number or specific extent. It merely had set out\nthe property by boundaries and the Chairman himself had issued several\nallotment letters by the same boundaries to other persons also and\ntherefore, the offer which had been made was vague and hence not\ncapable of enforcement .\n.\nThe entitlement for allotment of a plot, in my view, cannot be\ndenied and the petitioner shall be allotted a plot. Even the contention that\nthe plot that was offered by the Chairman of the Board was vague, is\ncontested by the counsel for the petitioner by saying that the property is\nspecifically described with boundaries and there is no difficulty about\nidentifying the same. Learned counsel for the respondent, however,\ncontends that within the boundaries mentioned, there is larger extent of\nproperty more than 2000 sq. yds, which the petitioner is not entitled to. He\ncontends that the Improvement Trust has passed a Resolution on 6.2.2001\nCWP No.7958 of 1988\n-5-\nproposing to raise a monument in the memory of martyrs of Kargil at the\nproperty, which the petitioner claims having been allotted to him. The\nconstruction of the memorial was stayed by an order of this Court in this writ\npetition, when the place was sought to be demarcated by erection of steel\ngrill fencing.\n.\nThe exact location of the property and the extent of property,\noriginally allotted to the petitioner as wholly falling within the boundaries, is\na subject of dispute between the parties, which this court in its exercise of\njurisdictional power under Article 226 of Constitution cannot unravel without\nany further evidence. If the property, which is available there within the\nboundaries is only limited to the extent of 300 sq. yds, even a subsequent\nResolution setting it apart for constructing a monument, shall not be put out\nagainst the petitioner. It shall be duty of the respondent to look for some\nother property for such use. If, on the other hand, the extent of property is\nlarger, and the petitioner shall not be entitled to allotment of such a large\nplot, then the respondent would be entitled to put it to use for which a\nResolution has been passed and they shall be at liberty to allot to the\npetitioner any other alternative plot, which is available under the Scheme.\n.\nThe writ petition is allowed in the above terms. The compliance\nof order shall be made within a period of three months.\nCR No.2515 of 1989 (O&M)\nThere is no representation for the petitioner. The order of\nimpleadment already made by the court below, is confirmed in the light of\nentitlement as formed in the order in the writ petition. The Civil Revision is\ntherefore dismissed.\nMarch 09, 2010\n (K.KANNAN)\nVt\nJUDGE"

      "the firm. Subsequently, District Manager had resolved the dispute. It was decided that 44 bags would be given by the Mandi Firm and balance would be recovered from the Storekeeper S.S. Nagpal. Therefore, it was stated that petitioner had nothing to do with the embezzlement. Regarding second charge, it was stated that no bags of HAFED are lying at Hassanpur Mandi. The Inquiry Officer found the submissions made by the petitioner before the Inquiry Officer, to be unsatisfactory and held him guilty on both counts. Therefore, the show cause notice (Annexure P-4) was served, as to why he be not dismissed from service. Reply to the show cause notice was filed. The same has been annexed as Annexure P-5. Reply was also rejected and vide Annexure P-10, services of the petitioner were dismissed. Aggrieved against the same, petitioner had filed an appeal (Annexure P-11) and as stated earlier, vide Annexure P-12, appeal was dismissed. Dismissal order, in the present case, was passed on 26th April, and the appeal was dismissed on 6th March, 1987. Simultaneously, the employer respondent HAFED had initiated recovery proceedings against the petitioner for an amount of Rs.22,220/-, for embezzlement of bags of wheat, which was lying at Hodal Mandi and 29 bags of wheat of Hassanpur Centre, which were lying with M/s Jai Kishan Trading Co., Hassanpur. In the recovery proceedings so initiated by the employer, Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Palwal, District Faridabad, vide a well reasoned order (Annexure P-14), held as under: Hafed has only produced copy of P.V. report dated .6.80. Stock register and no other concrete evidence was produced. The evidence produced by Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A. Hodel which were Ann. 1 to 5 which were Civil Writ Petition No. 885 of 1998 attached in this file at page 29 to 40 which are concrete evidence. And Zile Singh has given in writing that payment of the Transporter be made only after deducting the price of 40 bags. Shri Zile Singh has given the evidence of 30 bags which were left with the Transporter. But according to stock position, statement 20.5.81, against him 38-10 bags were remained. This statement was prepared by the District Manager, Hafed. Therefore, P.V. has no value. About 10 bags Shri Zile Singh has written in his letter that in one truck which was loaded in excess of which payment was taken after unloading the same by the Truck driver of the Transporter with some shopkeeper at Delhi and Shri Zile Singh has written in his statement that Transporter has deposited the price of 8 bags in Hafed R.H.A. Hodel. This statement was also heard and read by Shri Deepak Kumar, District Accountant, But he had not raised any objection to it. Even then if payment of 8 bags were not taken from the transporter then Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A. Hodel may be held liable. The price of the rest of the 30 bags must be deducted from the payment of the transporter at the time of payment. Payment of this was made by the then D.M. Hafed, Faridabad and at the time of payment to the Transporter, that amount was not deducted. Therefore, for this amount the D.M. Hafed Faridabad of that time is responsible. Therefore, case be prepared against him. Today dated 4.2.86, the order is announced in the open Court in the presence of Shri Nav Rattan Singh, District Manager, Hafed, Faridabad, Shri Deepak Kumar, District Accountant, Hafed, Faridabad and Shri Rajbir Singh, D.O. (M.S.) Hafed Faridabad (Petitioner) and Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A. Hodel (Defendant). Civil Writ Petition No. 885 of 1998 Ms. Munisha Gandhi appearing for the petitioner has raised two fold submissions before this Court. Firstly, it has been stated that in the recovery proceedings, the plea raised by the petitioner has been accepted. Same plea was raised by the petitioner before the Inquiry Officer and therefore, in parallel proceedings, two contrary findings have been arrived at. It has been further submitted that order passed by the Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, who is an independent quasi-judicial authority, has absolved the petitioner of the charges and the order passed by Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Palwal should be taken into consideration by the Department, as the petitioner has proved his innocence. It has been further stated that appeal of the petitioner has been dismissed vide Annexure P-12 and the order of the appellate authority does not reflect any application of mind. It only states that after discussion, the Committee felt that there was no force in the appeal of Zile Singh, and rejected his appeal. It has been further stated that the coram of order (Annexure P-12) will show that the Managing Director, HAFED was present. It has been stated that the impugned order was passed by the Managing Director, HAFED, therefore, he could not participate in the Administrative Committee, as he could not be a Judge of his own cause. Therefore, order (Annexure P-12) is vitiated. Mr. H.S. Gill, Senior Advocate assisted by Mr. Ramesh Dhiman, states that the Managing Director, HAFED, present was not the same person. I am of the view that this contention cannot be accepted. Therefore, the order of the appellate authority is set aside. The order was passed by the Managing Director in his official capacity and the Managing Director is bound to defend the order before the Administrative Committee, therefore, the order (Annexure P-12) is liable to be set aside. Taking into Civil Writ Petition No. 885 of 1998 consideration the fact that during pendency of the appeal, order Annexure P-14 has been passed in favour of the petitioner, legal representatives of the petitioner are permitted to file fresh grounds of appeal and may also place on record Annexure P-16 and P-17 before the Appellate Authority, which, on consideration of the same, will pass a speaking order. The appeal shall be decided within six months after the receipt of certified copy of this order. With these observations, present writ petition is disposed off.

Vide Annexure P-10, an order was passed by the Managing\nDirector, Haryana State Cooperative Supply & Marketing Federation\nLimited, that petitioner has embezzled 55 bags of wheat amounting to\nRs.7425/- out of wheat stocks lying at Hodal Mandi and he failed to lift 29\nbags of wheat of Hassanpur Centre lying with M/s Jai Kishan Trading Co.,\nHassanpur and had thus caused loss of Rs.3915/-. The Managing Director\nheld that he has no reason as to why punishment proposed in the show\ncause notice should not be made final. In the show cause notice given to\nthe petitioner, dismissal from the service was proposed. Vide Annexure\nCivil Writ Petition No. 885 of 1998\nP-12, an appeal preferred by the petitioner was dismissed by the\nAdministrative Committee of the respondent Haryana State Cooperative\nSupply & Marketing Federation Limited (hereinafter referred to as,\n HAFED ). \nBriefly stated, case of the petitioner is that he joined HAFED\nas a Clerk on 1st November, 1960. He was promoted as Assistant in the\nyear 1969. Due to good service record, he was promoted to the post of\nManager Grade-B in the year 1976. It has been averred that during the\nentire service record, no adverse remark was reported against the\npetitioner. In May 1980, petitioner was transferred to Hassanpur\nProcurement Centre as Manager, In-charge of Wheat Procurement Centre,\nHassanpur. In July, 1980 he was transferred from Hassanpur Procurement\nCentre to Hodel Procurement Centre. On 20th November, 1980, a\nchargesheet was served upon the petitioner, in which two charges were\nset out. The chargesheet has been attached as Annexure P-1, and the\nsame reads as under: \n 1.\nThat he has sold 55 bags of wheat valuing Rs.7425/-\nout of Hafed wheat stock of 131 bags lying in the Hodal\nMandi. This stock was required to be lifted by him and stored\nin the Hafed godown. Instead of doing this lawful duty he sold\nbags out of this stock and embezzled its sale proceeds for\nhis personal ends.\nSimilarly, Shri Zile Singh has failed to arrange the lying of 29\nbags of wheat of Hafed from Hassanpur Centre lying with M/s\nJai Kishan Trading Co. Hassanpur. This stock is now not\navailable with the said firm which emplies a direct loss to\nHafed to the extent of Rs.3915/-. As such he is responsible for\ncausing this loss to Hafed alongwith Shri S.S. Nagpal,\nAccountant-cum-Store Keeper.  \nReply was filed by the petitioner, in which he stated that when\nhe joined at Hodel, 55 bags were pending with M/s Rawat Shop Hodal and\nCivil Writ Petition No. 885 of 1998\nthis fact can be verified from the record. It was further stated Rail Head\nAgency (RHA) of the firm retained Rs.400/- and therefore, there was a\nconflict between the RHA and the firm. Subsequently, District Manager had\nresolved the dispute. It was decided that 44 bags would be given by the\nMandi Firm and balance would be recovered from the Storekeeper S.S.\nNagpal. Therefore, it was stated that petitioner had nothing to do with the\nembezzlement. Regarding second charge, it was stated that no bags of\nHAFED are lying at Hassanpur Mandi. The Inquiry Officer found the\nsubmissions made by the petitioner before the Inquiry Officer, to be\nunsatisfactory and held him guilty on both counts. Therefore, the show\ncause notice (Annexure P-4) was served, as to why he be not dismissed\nfrom service. Reply to the show cause notice was filed. The same has\nbeen annexed as Annexure P-5. Reply was also rejected and vide\nAnnexure P-10, services of the petitioner were dismissed. \nAggrieved against the same, petitioner had filed an appeal\n(Annexure P-11) and as stated earlier, vide Annexure P-12, appeal was\ndismissed. Dismissal order, in the present case, was passed on 26th April,\nand the appeal was dismissed on 6th March, 1987. Simultaneously,\nthe employer respondent HAFED had initiated recovery proceedings\nagainst the petitioner for an amount of Rs.22,220/-, for embezzlement of\nbags of wheat, which was lying at Hodal Mandi and 29 bags of wheat of\nHassanpur Centre, which were lying with M/s Jai Kishan Trading Co.,\nHassanpur.

About 10 bags Shri Zile Singh\nhas written in his letter that in one truck which was loaded in\nexcess of which payment was taken after unloading the same\nby the Truck driver of the Transporter with some shopkeeper at\nDelhi and Shri Zile Singh has written in his statement that\nTransporter has deposited the price of 8 bags in Hafed R.H.A.\nHodel. This statement was also heard and read by Shri\nDeepak Kumar, District Accountant, But he had not raised any\nobjection to it. Even then if payment of 8 bags were not taken\nfrom the transporter then Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A.\nHodel may be held liable. The price of the rest of the 30 bags\nmust be deducted from the payment of the transporter at the\ntime of payment. Payment of this was made by the then D.M.\nHafed, Faridabad and at the time of payment to the\nTransporter, that amount was not deducted. Therefore, for this\namount the D.M. Hafed Faridabad of that time is responsible.\nTherefore, case be prepared against him. Today dated 4.2.86,\nthe order is announced in the open Court in the presence of\nShri Nav Rattan Singh, District Manager, Hafed, Faridabad,\nShri Deepak Kumar, District Accountant, Hafed, Faridabad and\nShri Rajbir Singh, D.O. (M.S.) Hafed Faridabad (Petitioner)\nand Shri Zile Singh, Ex. Manager, R.H.A. Hodel (Defendant).  \nCivil Writ Petition No. 885 of 1998\nMs. Munisha Gandhi appearing for the petitioner has raised\ntwo fold submissions before this Court. Firstly, it has been stated that in the\nrecovery proceedings, the plea raised by the petitioner has been accepted.\nSame plea was raised by the petitioner before the Inquiry Officer and\ntherefore, in parallel proceedings, two contrary findings have been arrived\nat. It has been further submitted that order passed by the Assistant\nRegistrar, Cooperative Societies, who is an independent quasi-judicial\nauthority, has absolved the petitioner of the charges and the order passed\nby Assistant Registrar, Cooperative Societies, Palwal should be taken into\nconsideration by the Department, as the petitioner has proved his\ninnocence. It has been further stated that appeal of the petitioner has been\ndismissed vide Annexure P-12 and the order of the appellate authority\ndoes not reflect any application of mind. It only states that after discussion,\nthe Committee felt that there was no force in the appeal of Zile Singh, and\nrejected his appeal. It has been further stated that the coram of order\n(Annexure P-12) will show that the Managing Director, HAFED was\npresent. It has been stated that the impugned order was passed by the\nManaging Director, HAFED, therefore, he could not participate in the\nAdministrative Committee, as he could not be a Judge of his own cause.\nTherefore, order (Annexure P-12) is vitiated. \nMr. H.S. Gill, Senior Advocate assisted by Mr. Ramesh\nDhiman, states that the Managing Director, HAFED, present was not the\nsame person. \nI am of the view that this contention cannot be accepted.\nTherefore, the order of the appellate authority is set aside. The order was\npassed by the Managing Director in his official capacity and the Managing\nDirector is bound to defend the order before the Administrative Committee,\ntherefore, the order (Annexure P-12) is liable to be set aside. Taking into\nCivil Writ Petition No. 885 of 1998\nconsideration the fact that during pendency of the appeal, order Annexure\nP-14 has been passed in favour of the petitioner, legal representatives of\nthe petitioner are permitted to file fresh grounds of appeal and may also\nplace on record Annexure P-16 and P-17 before the Appellate Authority,\nwhich, on consideration of the same, will pass a speaking order. The\nappeal shall be decided within six months after the receipt of certified copy\nof this order. \nWith these observations, present writ petition is disposed off. \n [KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA]\nJUDGE \nDecember 11, 2008\nrps"

      "the Aarti cinema and all the buses coming from the side of Moga stop on that bus stop. It is correct that there is a rickshaw stand in between Arti Cinema and the chowk on the left side of the road while coming from Moga. Aarti Cinema chowk is a thickly populated area and there is great rush of vehicles on that part of the road. It is incorrect to suggest that Gurmukh Singh was struck down by a truck who ran away and the bus was wrongly involved while bus was stationary on the bus stop. It is also incorrect to suggest that I was not present at the place and time of accident.---------- I had not stated in my police statement that I and the deceased were going to that side in connection with the business of our FAO No.161 of 1988 7 shop. I did not see the deceased going in front of me. I saw him after the accident. I reached the place of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident. It is correct that the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna moped from the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on the side of the round about. The place of accident is that part of the round about of the chowk which faces Gurdev Nagar road. I saw him dead for the first time. Many persons had gathered there at the place of accident.---------- A perusal of the statement made by PW1 Mohinder Singh would show that the deceased was going on his Luna Moped ahead of the bus and not in front of the bus. He further stated that the deceased was taking turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk and at that time the bus crushed him to death which was being driven by driver-respondent No.4. He reiterated the statement when cross-examined by the learned counsel for respondents No.1 to 3 and denied the suggestion that Gurmukh Singh infact had struck against the truck which ran away, while the bus was stationary on the bus stop or that he was not present at the place and time of accident. During the cross-examination by driver-respondent No.4 the witness has stated that he did not see the deceased going in front of him, but there was no contradiction between the examination-in-chief and cross- examination. As such as in the examination-in-chief the witness had stated that the deceased was going ahead of the bus. The witness further stated that he saw the deceased after the accident and had reached the place of accident or 15 minutes after the accident. The afore mentioned statement made during cross-examination does not necessarily mean that the witness was FAO No.161 of 1988 8 giving an eye witness account. In fact, the witness was explaining the circumstantial evidence which lead to an inference that the deceased was killed in the accident on account of rash and negligent driving of bus by driver Kamikkar Singh, respondent No.4. The afore mentioned version finds support from the contents of the FIR recorded after about one hour. It shows that driver-respondent No.4, after hitting Gurmukh Singh, the deceased, stopped the bus at a distance and on coming to know about the death of Gurmukh Singh-deceased, he had run away. In these circumstances the statement made in the FIR if has been used for the purpose of contradiction can also be used for the purpose of corroboration. Such is the position of law under Section 162 of Criminal Procedure Code 1973. According to the proviso to Section 162(1) of Cr.P.C, if the statement made in the FIR is proved then the same may be used by the accused and with the permission of the Court by the prosecution to contradict a witness in the manner provided by Section 145 of Evidence Act, 1872 and that any part of the statement made in the FIR could also be used for corroboration. The principle incorporated by Section 162 Cr.P.C. would be applicable and the section itself ipso-facto may not apply. If that be so than the FIR and the statement made before the court read together would lead to only one conclusion that there were adequate circumstances supporting the inference that accident was caused by the offending bus which was being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4. Therefore, the findings recorded by the Tribunal are liable to be set aside. Even otherwise this court has held in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey Sham reported as 1993(2) PLR 109 that once a driver has been tried of an offence of rash and negligent driving, it is prima-facie safe to conclude that FAO No.161 of 1988 9 the accident had occurred on that account. I have also gone through the file of the Trial Court in Criminal Case No.137/2/87 which has been decided on .9.1992. Once the findings are recorded that the accident was the result of rash and negligent driving, the other question which require consideration is whether Rs.36,000/- awarded by the Tribunal in favour of the claimant/appellants was sufficient. A perusal of the record shows that the deceased Gurmukh Singh was a student of LL.B as is evident from his identity card of Government College, Ludhiana,wherein his roll number has also been disclosed. The afore mentioned photocopy of identity card is available at Page 35 of the paper book. The Tribunal has proceeded on the assumption that he was drawing salary of Rs.650/- per month from a private school and would have parted with Rs.200/- to his parents, brother and sister. The Tribunal has failed to take into account the future prospectus of advancing his career by the deceased. He was a student of LL.B. and might have established his legal practice. Therefore, his salary at the rate of Rs.650/-, as a Teacher, could not have been the correct reflection of his income. The formula and the principles for working out the prospective income of a deceased have been explained in some details in G.M.Kerala SRTC Vs. Susama Thomos (1994) 2-SCC 176 and Sarla Dixit Vs. Balwant Yadav (1996)3-SCC 179. Following the afore mentioned principles the income of the deceased would work out as 650 x 3 2 = 975, which can be rounded to Rs.1000/-. The deceased would have contributed Rs.350/- per month to the claimant/appellants and the annual dependency comes to Rs.4200/-. A multiplier of 15 if applied then the total amount comes to Rs.63000/-. FAO No.161 of 1988 10 In view of the afore mentioned findings, the award of the Tribunal is modified and an amount of Rs.63000/- along with 10% interest is awarded to the claimant/appellants. The claimant/appellants No.1 & 2 are to apportion the award to the extent of 35% each and claimant/appellant No.3 along with claimant/respondents No.6 & 7 are awarded 10% each. The whole liability has to be discharged by respondents No.1 to 4 as respondent No.5 was merely an insurance company of the Moped. The appeal stands disposed of in the above terms.

No.161 of 1988\n\nDate of Decision:20.9.2006.\nBara Singh and others\n....Appellants.\nVersus\nThe State of Punjab and others\n...Respondents.\nCORAM : Hon'ble Mr.Justice M.M.Kumar. \nPresent:-\nMr.Satinder Khanna,Advocate\n for the appellants.\nMr.S.K.Bhanot, Sr. DAG Punjab\nfor respondents No.1 to 4.\nMr. Sanjiv Pabbi, Advocate\nfor respondent No.5.\n****\nM.M.KUMAR, J.\nThis appeal filed under Section 110-D of the Motor Vehicles\nAct, 1939, challenges the award dated 8.10.1987 passed by the Motor\nAccident Claims Tribunal, Ludhiana ( for brevity `MACT'). The Tribunal\nhas recorded findings that the claimant/appellants have not been able to\nprove the accident or the fact that the deceased Gurmukh Singh received\ninjuries on account of rash and negligent driving of the bus by Kamikkar\nSingh, driver-respondent No.4. The Tribunal has further held that the\nclaimant/appellants were the legal representatives of deceased Gurmukh\nSingh and that the income of deceased Gurmukh Singh was Rs.650/- per\nFAO No.161 of 1988 2\nmonth and the dependency has been worked out at Rs.200/- per month. A\nmultiplier of 15 has been applied. The father of the deceased\nclaimant/appellant No.1 has been found to be 50 years of age and mother of\nthe deceased claimant/appellant No.2 has been found to be 45 years of age.\nThe other claimants were the brother and sister. However, only Daljit Kaur,\nminor, who was 16 years of age, has filed the appeal being\nclaimant/appellant No.3. The deceased was 23 years of age at the time of his\ndeath and was post graduate. Accordingly a multiplier of 15 was applied\nand a total claim of Rs.36,000/- as compensation was calculated. However,\non account of the fact that the claimant/appellants had failed to prove the\naccident, their claim application was dismissed. It would be appropriate to\nmake a reference to the analysis of evidence undertaken by the tribunal to\nreach the conclusion that the accident did not take place on 11.2.1987 at\n:30 p.m. The same reads as under:-\n In support of this issue, the claimants have examined\nMohinder Singh, PW1. He has stated that on 11.2.1987 at\nabout 5:30 PM he was coming on a Luna Moped on Moga-\nLudhiana road and when he was at some distance from Aarti\nCinema Chowk towards Moga side the bus came from the side\nof Moga which was being driven at a very fast speed and at that\ntime the deceased was also going on a Luna Moped from the\nside of Moga and he was crushed by the bus driver under the\nbus when he was taking a turn on his right side near Aarti\nCinema Chowk to go to Gurdev Nagar. In his cross-\nexamination, he has stated that he did not see the deceased\nGurmukh Singh going in front of him and he saw him for the\nFAO No.161 of 1988 3\nfirst time after the accident and that he reached the place of\naccident after 10 or 15 minutes of the accident. He has further\nadmitted that it is correct that the place of accident is not\nvisible to a person coming on a Luna Moped from the side of\nJagraon as the accident took place on that side of the round\nabout which faces Gurdev Nagar, Ludhiana.\nThe learned counsel for the claimants has argued that the\naccident stands proved from the statement of Mohinder Singh,\nPW1 as referred above. In reply to this argument, the learned\ncounsel for the respondents have argued that no accident is\nproved from the statement of Mohinder Singh, PW1 as he has\nclearly admitted in his cross-examination that he reached the\nplace of accident after about 10 or 15 minutes after the accident\nand the place of accident is not visible to a person coming on a\nLuna Moped coming from the side of Jagraon. This argument\nseems to be correct. In case Mohinder Singh PW1 reached the\nplace of accident 10 or 15 minutes after the accident, then it\nmeans that he did not witness the accident. No other witness\nhas been examined by the claimants to prove the accident. The\ncase of the claimants is that one Jagdish Lal also witnessed the\naccident, but he has not been examined by them for the reasons\nbest known to them. The respondents have examined Kamikkar\nSingh driver, respondent No.4 in rebuttal as PW1. He has\ndenied the allegations that the accident took place with his bus.\nUnder these circumstances, there is no evidence on the file to\nprove that the accident took place with the bus which was\nFAO No.161 of 1988 4\nbeing driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver respondent No.4 and\nGurmukh Singh received injuries in that accident. Thus, this\nissue remains un-proved and is decided against the claimants.\nDuring the pendency of the appeal, learned counsel for the\nclaimant/appellants filed an application under Order 41 Rule 27 CPC with\nthe prayer to place on record a copy of the FIR No.30 dated 11.2.1987,\nregistered at Police Station Civil Line Ludhiana, an hour after the accident.\nThe accident had taken place at 5:30 p.m. and the FIR was lodged at 6:45\np.m. Vide a separate order passed today, the afore-mentioned application\nhas been allowed as it was not brought on record before the Tribunal. \nMr. Satinder Khanna, learned counsel for the\nclaimant/appellants has argued that the approach adopted by the Tribunal in\ndiscarding the statement made by Mohinder Singh PW1 on the ground that\nhe was not an eye witness as he reached the place of accident after 10-15\nminutes is absolutely illegal. The version disclosed in the FIR would\nhighlight that the deceased Gurmukh Singh was going in front of Mohinder\nSingh, the author of the FIR, on his Luna Moped bearing registration\nNo.PJL 5057. Mohinder Singh was also following him on his own Luna\nNo. PAL 9024. According to learned counsel, the statement made in the\ncourt was recorded after about 8 months and the detailed authentic version\nhas been disclosed in the FIR lodged after about one hour. Learned\ncounsel has emphasised that had the respondents desired, they could have\nconfronted PW1 Mohinder Singh with this FIR where the version is\ndifferent than the one disclosed in the statement made before the court. He\nhas argued that once the driver of a vehicle is tried on account of rash and\nnegligent driving it has to be prima-facie concluded that the accident was\nFAO No.161 of 1988 5\ncaused on account of rash and negligent driving, therefore, learned counsel\nhas argued that the findings recorded by the Tribunal on Issue No.1 are\nliable to be reversed and it must be held that the accident has been caused\non account of rash and negligent driving by Kamikkar Singh, driver-\nrespondent No.4.\nMr.S.K.Bhanot, learned State counsel has however, submitted\nthat the tribunal has taken into account the statement made by the witness\nMohinder Singh (PW1) admitting that he had reached the place of accident\nafter 10 or 15 minutes and that the place of accident was not visible to a\nperson coming on a Luna Moped from the side of Jagraon. So he has\nsubmitted that the FIR cannot be taken into consideration unless it is proved\neither by its author or any other person. Therefore, it has been suggested\nthat the FIR cannot be taken into account at this stage and the findings\ndeserve to be upheld. \nHaving heard learned counsel and perusing the record of the\nTribunal, I am of the considered view that the findings recorded by the\nTribunal cannot be sustained in the eyes of law. The Tribunal has stretched\nthe statement of PW1 Mohinder Singh that he reached the place of accident\n-15 minutes later. The statement of Mohinder Singh PW1 infact no\nwhere suggests that he was not an eye witness to the accident. The relevant\nportions of the statement in chief and the cross-examination are as under:-\n On 11.2.87 at about 5:30 PM I was coming on the Moga\nLudhiana road on a Luna Moped. When I was at some distance\nfrom Aarti Cinema towards Moga side, bus No.PJG 3108 came\nfrom the side of Moga. It was being driven at a very fast speed.\nGurmukh Singh was also coming on a Luna Moped from the\nFAO No.161 of 1988 6\nside of Moga. He was ahead of the bus. When Gurmukh Singh\nwas taking a turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk\nthe bus crushed him to death. The bus was being driven by\nKamikkar Singh driver. The bus driver did not blow the horn.\nThe bus was out of his control on account of the high speed.\nGurmukh Singh was aged about 23 years. He died at the spot.\nOne Jagdish Lal witnessed the accident. At about 8 PM the\ndead body of Gurmukh Singh was taken by us to Civil\nHospital, Ludhiana, where it was subjected to post mortem\nexamination.----------\nThe accident took place in that chowk when Gurmukh Singh\nwas negotiating a turn on his right side to go to Gurdev Nagar.\nIt is incorrect to suggest that there is a bus stop on the\nLudhiana Moga road in between Aarti Cinema chowk and the\nAarti cinema and all the buses coming from the side of Moga\nstop on that bus stop. It is correct that there is a rickshaw stand\nin between Arti Cinema and the chowk on the left side of the\nroad while coming from Moga. Aarti Cinema chowk is a\nthickly populated area and there is great rush of vehicles on\nthat part of the road. It is incorrect to suggest that Gurmukh\nSingh was struck down by a truck who ran away and the bus\nwas wrongly involved while bus was stationary on the bus stop.\nIt is also incorrect to suggest that I was not present at the place\nand time of accident.----------\nI had not stated in my police statement that I and the deceased\nwere going to that side in connection with the business of our\nFAO No.161 of 1988 7\nshop. I did not see the deceased going in front of me. I saw\nhim after the accident. I reached the place of accident 10 or 15\nminutes after the accident. It is correct that the place of\naccident is not visible to a person coming on a Luna moped\nfrom the side of Jagraon as the accident took place on the side\nof the round about. The place of accident is that part of the\nround about of the chowk which faces Gurdev Nagar road. I\nsaw him dead for the first time. Many persons had gathered\nthere at the place of accident.----------  \nA perusal of the statement made by PW1 Mohinder Singh\nwould show that the deceased was going on his Luna Moped ahead of the\nbus and not in front of the bus. He further stated that the deceased was\ntaking turn on his right side near Aarti Cinema Chowk and at that time the\nbus crushed him to death which was being driven by driver-respondent\nNo.4. He reiterated the statement when cross-examined by the learned\ncounsel for respondents No.1 to 3 and denied the suggestion that Gurmukh\nSingh infact had struck against the truck which ran away, while the bus was\nstationary on the bus stop or that he was not present at the place and time of\naccident. During the cross-examination by driver-respondent No.4 the\nwitness has stated that he did not see the deceased going in front of him,\nbut there was no contradiction between the examination-in-chief and cross-\nexamination. As such as in the examination-in-chief the witness had stated\nthat the deceased was going ahead of the bus. The witness further stated that\nhe saw the deceased after the accident and had reached the place of accident\nor 15 minutes after the accident. The afore mentioned statement made\nduring cross-examination does not necessarily mean that the witness was\nFAO No.161 of 1988 8\ngiving an eye witness account. In fact, the witness was explaining the\ncircumstantial evidence which lead to an inference that the deceased was\nkilled in the accident on account of rash and negligent driving of bus by\ndriver Kamikkar Singh, respondent No.4. The afore mentioned version\nfinds support from the contents of the FIR recorded after about one hour. It\nshows that driver-respondent No.4, after hitting Gurmukh Singh, the\ndeceased, stopped the bus at a distance and on coming to know about the\ndeath of Gurmukh Singh-deceased, he had run away. \n In these circumstances the statement made in the FIR if has\nbeen used for the purpose of contradiction can also be used for the purpose\nof corroboration. Such is the position of law under Section 162 of Criminal\nProcedure Code 1973. According to the proviso to Section 162(1) of\nCr.P.C, if the statement made in the FIR is proved then the same may be\nused by the accused and with the permission of the Court by the prosecution\nto contradict a witness in the manner provided by Section 145 of Evidence\nAct, 1872 and that any part of the statement made in the FIR could also be\nused for corroboration. The principle incorporated by Section 162 Cr.P.C.\nwould be applicable and the section itself ipso-facto may not apply. If that\nbe so than the FIR and the statement made before the court read together\nwould lead to only one conclusion that there were adequate circumstances\nsupporting the inference that accident was caused by the offending bus\nwhich was being driven by Kamikkar Singh, driver-respondent No.4.\nTherefore, the findings recorded by the Tribunal are liable to be set aside.\nEven otherwise this court has held in the case of Girdhari Lal Vs. Radhey\nSham reported as 1993(2) PLR 109 that once a driver has been tried of an\noffence of rash and negligent driving, it is prima-facie safe to conclude that\nFAO No.161 of 1988 9\nthe accident had occurred on that account.

The Tribunal has proceeded on the\nassumption that he was drawing salary of Rs.650/- per month from a private\nschool and would have parted with Rs.200/- to his parents, brother and\nsister. The Tribunal has failed to take into account the future prospectus of\nadvancing his career by the deceased. He was a student of LL.B. and might\nhave established his legal practice. Therefore, his salary at the rate of\nRs.650/-, as a Teacher, could not have been the correct reflection of his\nincome. The formula and the principles for working out the prospective\nincome of a deceased have been explained in some details in G.M.Kerala\nSRTC Vs. Susama Thomos (1994) 2-SCC 176 and Sarla Dixit Vs. Balwant\nYadav (1996)3-SCC 179. Following the afore mentioned principles the\nincome of the deceased would work out as 650 x 3   2 = 975, which can be\nrounded to Rs.1000/-. The deceased would have contributed Rs.350/- per\nmonth to the claimant/appellants and the annual dependency comes to\nRs.4200/-. A multiplier of 15 if applied then the total amount comes to\nRs.63000/-.\nFAO No.161 of 1988 10\nIn view of the afore mentioned findings, the award of the\nTribunal is modified and an amount of Rs.63000/- along with 10% interest\nis awarded to the claimant/appellants. The claimant/appellants No.1 & 2\nare to apportion the award to the extent of 35% each and claimant/appellant\nNo.3 along with claimant/respondents No.6 & 7 are awarded 10% each.\nThe whole liability has to be discharged by respondents No.1 to 4 as\nrespondent No.5 was merely an insurance company of the Moped. \nThe appeal stands disposed of in the above terms. \n (M.M.KUMAR)\n JUDGE\nSept 20,2006.\nReema"

For the incident of 3.2.1990, an FIR No.308 dated 9.12.1990 under Section 498-A IPC had been registered at P.S City Bahadurgarh at the instance of father of the respondent-wife. Annexure P-3 shows that all the witnesses including respondent-wife had turned hostile in that case and did not support their allegations and then accused, who happened to be present appellant i.e husband Hardeep, his father, mother and sister had been acquitted on 16.8.1994. Even in spite of that, things did not improve and present petition for divorce had been filed in July 1995. Now more than 17 years have passed when the marriage took place. There had been litigation in the form of earlier petition under Section of the Hindu Marriage Act, 125 Cr.P.C, a criminal case for offence under Section 498-A IPC and second petition for divorce filed in 1995. Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 62 of the judgment reported in Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 had observed as under: Even at this stage, the respondent does not want divorce by mutual consent. From the analysis and evaluation of FAO.No.81-M of 1998 #5# the entire evidence, it is clear that the respondent has resolved to live in agony only to make life a miserable hell for the appellant as well. This type of adamant and callous attitude, in the context of the facts of this case, leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that the respondent is bent upon treating the appellant with mental cruelty. It is abundantly clear that the marriage between the parties had broken down irretrievably and there is no chance of their coming together, or living together again. When the case for the offence under Section 498-A IPC was registered and the husband, his sister and parents-in-law were arrested and thereafter during trial the witnesses turn hostile and husband and other relatives are acquitted, then it is itself a cruelty practised. This is further born out from the fact that father of the respondent-wife had written complaints copy Annexure P-1 so that husband does not get posting as ACP and then posting of the husband to the HCS was delayed at the instance of respondent or her father and husband could get appointment only through the intervention of the Court. In the case before Hon'ble Supreme Court, parties had been living separately for more than 10 years whereas in this case, they had been living separately for more than 16 years and there had been criminal and civil proceedings between the parties. The marriage has subsisted only in name. It has wrecked beyond the hope of salvage. Respondent still does not want divorce by mutual consent. Preservation of marriage is totally unworkable and is source of misery for the parties. Marriage has definitely FAO.No.81-M of 1998 #6# been irretrievably broken down. Under these circumstances, petition for divorce is allowed. It is directed that the marriage between the parties shall stand dissolved subject to the condition that the husband-appellant, who is an officer of Haryana Civil Services pays/deposits Rs.10,00,000/- as permanent alimony. Let Rs.5,00,000/- be paid within a period of three months and another Rs.5,00,000/- within six months. Failing to pay or deposit this permanent alimony as directed, this appeal and the petition for divorce shall stand dismissed. The amount as ordered be deposited in this Court.

JUSTICE M.M. AGGARWAL\n.*.*.*.\nPresent:\nDr. Surya Parkash, Advocate.\nMr. Arun Jain, Advocate.\nM.M. AGGARWAL,J\nThis is an appeal against judgment dated 24.4.1998 passed by\nAdditional District Judge, Hisar whereby petition under Section 13 of the\nHindu Marriage Act for dissolution of marriage filed by the present\nappellant i.e husband Hardeep against his wife Sunita respondent was\ndismissed.\nThe marriage in this case had taken place on 10.5.1989 at\nBahadurgarh. The parties had lived as husband and wife at Hansi but no\nchild was born out of the wedlock. At the time of marriage, appellant is\nstated to be a Probationary Officer in Bank but he was preparing and \nFAO.No.81-M of 1998\n#2#\nappearing for Central Services Examination. \nAccording to the appellant, respondent wife did not cooperate\nwith him and started torturing him. She was suffering from inferiority\ncomplex and never wanted appellant to get high position in life. Then on\n.2.1990, when she was at matrimonial home at Hansi, she started\nquarrelling with him and other family members without any rhyme and\nreason and created a scene by coming out of the house into street and then\nwhen he along with his family members as also one Ram Kumar was\npresent in the house, she deliberately poured kerosene oil upon herself and\nput her ablaze with the calculated mind of establishing that she could use\ncoercive methods. Then he (husband appellant) had doused her flames.\nThat respondent-wife was in fact guilty of attempting to commit suicide but\nshe falsely got registered the case for the offence under Section 498-A IPC\nin which appellant, his aged parents of the appellant and sister-in-law were\narrested and remained in jail for several days. \nFurther petitioner-husband was selected in the Central Services\nto be posted as ACP but respondent-wife created problems. Later on,\nappellant was selected for HCS post and again respondent created problems\nagainst his appointment and the appellant could get the appointment only\nafter filing writ in this Court. Earlier a petition for divorce had been filed\nby the husband in the year 1990, which was dismissed on merits on\n.10.1992 copy Annexure R-11 and appeal had been filed in this Court\nagainst that judgment but that was dismissed as husband did not pay the\nmaintenance. \nIn the earlier petition, ground of cruelty had been taken but\nsince there was FIR of the occurrence dated 3.2.1990 and that matter was \nFAO.No.81-M of 1998\n#3#\npending trial, grounds of cruelty of incident of 3.2.1990 were not taken into\nconsideration and discussed. In the present petition, there was an issue\nwhether the petition was barred by principle of resjudicata. Additional\nDistrict Judge had held that all the instances of cruelty except incident of\n.2.1990 were barred by principle of resjudicata and only incident of\n.2.1990 was considered and it had been held that the appellant was not\nentitled to decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty.\nCounsel for the appellant-husband had argued that the marriage\ntook place in the year 1989. Parties had lived together only for short time\nand they are living separately since 1990 and it is a broken marriage. It was\nargued that false FIR was got registered of the incident of 3.2.1990.\nAppellant-husband, his father, mother and his sister were arrested and the\nappellant-husband could not get service as ACP and then as HCS Officer\nand he could get the service only after a writ petition was filed in this Court\nand order dated 22.7.1993 (copy Annexure P-2) was made. It was argued\nthat in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in\nNaveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 , it is a fit case,\nwhere marriage should be dissolved by decree of divorce.\nOn behalf of the respondent-wife, it was argued that from the\nvery beginning, petitioner-husband had made up his mind not to keep the\nwife. He had even written letter copy Annexure R-13 just after three\nmonths of the marriage. It was argued that the appellant cannot be\npermitted to take advantage of his own wrong.\nHowever, perusal of language of R-13 shows that petitioner\nwanted his wife to rise in life. From the record, it would come out that\nearlier petition for divorce had been filed in the year 1990 by the husband, \nFAO.No.81-M of 1998\n#4#\nwhich was dismissed. There were proceedings under Section 125 Cr.P.C,\nwhich was got dismissed as withdrawn by the wife (copy Annexure P-4) on\n.11.1993. The present petition for divorce had been filed on 31.7.1995 and\nwas decided on 24.4.1998, more than eight years back. \nBefore hearing the arguments in this appeal, parties had been\ncalled to come present. They had appeared but then again it was found that\nno settlement between the parties in the form of mutual divorce or living\ntogether was possible. Husband is stated to be an HCS Officer whereas the\nwife is also stated to be employed in some private concern and may be\nearning some money.\nFor the incident of 3.2.1990, an FIR No.308 dated 9.12.1990\nunder Section 498-A IPC had been registered at P.S City Bahadurgarh at the\ninstance of father of the respondent-wife. Annexure P-3 shows that all the\nwitnesses including respondent-wife had turned hostile in that case and did\nnot support their allegations and then accused, who happened to be present\nappellant i.e husband Hardeep, his father, mother and sister had been\nacquitted on 16.8.1994. Even in spite of that, things did not improve and\npresent petition for divorce had been filed in July 1995.\nNow more than 17 years have passed when the marriage took\nplace. There had been litigation in the form of earlier petition under Section\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 125 Cr.P.C, a criminal case for offence under\nSection 498-A IPC and second petition for divorce filed in 1995. Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in para 62 of the judgment reported in Naveen Kohli v.\nNeelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 had observed as under:\n Even at this stage, the respondent does not want divorce\nby mutual consent. From the analysis and evaluation of \nFAO.No.81-M of 1998\n#5#\nthe entire evidence, it is clear that the respondent has\nresolved to live in agony only to make life a miserable\nhell for the appellant as well.

JUSTICE L. N. MITTAL.\nPresent:\nMr.Sandeep Jain, Advocate for the appellant.\nMr. Vikas Jain, Advocate for respondent Nos.1 to 3.\nRespondent No.4 ex parte.\nService of respondent No.5 dispensed with.\nL. N. MITTAL, J (ORAL)\nPlaintiff-Gurdev Singh having failed in both the Courts\nbelow, has filed the instant second appeal.\nPlaintiff-appellant alleged that he is in possession of the\nsuit property, which is shamlat property, for more than twenty years.\nThe defendants without any right, title or interest threatened to\ndispossess the plaintiff therefrom. The plaintiff sought permanent\ninjunction restraining the defendants from forcibly dispossessing the\nplaintiff from the suit property and from interfering in his possession\nthereon. \nDefendant Nos.1 to 4 contested the suit and denied the\nplaint averments. The defendants pleaded that plot Nos.12, 13, 29\nand 9 min were allotted to Attar Singh migrant from Pakistan being\nevacuee property in lieu of his claim of property left in Pakistan. Attar\nRSA No.221 of 2006 (O & M) \n-2-\nSingh was succeeded by his two sons Milkha Singh and Kartar\nSingh, who orally partitioned the said plots. Plot Nos. 29 and 9 min\nfell to the share of Milkha Singh and have been inherited by his sons\ndefendant Nos.1 to 3, which became owners in possession thereof,\nwho is the suit property. Plot Nos.12 and 13 fell to the share of\nKartar Singh. Defendant Nos.1 to 3 delivered possession of the suit\nproperty to defendant No.4 vide agreement dated 13.03.1997, who is\nin possession thereof. Various other pleas were also raised.\nDefendant Nos.2 to 4 were later on proceeded ex parte. Defendant\nNo.5 did not appear in spite of service and was proceeded ex parte\nin the trial Court. \nLearned Civil Judge (Junior Division), Nawashahr vide\njudgment and decree dated 17.09.2002 dismissed the plaintiff's suit.\nFirst appeal preferred by the plaintiff has been dismissed by learned\nAdditional District Judge, Nawanshahr vide judgment and decree\ndated 09.08.2005. Feeling aggrieved, plaintiff has filed the instant\nsecond appeal.\nI have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused\nthe case file.\nLearned counsel for the appellant vehemently contended\nthat the plaintiff-appellant is in possession of the suit property and,\ntherefore, cannot be dispossessed therefrom except in due course of\nlaw. Reliance in support of this contention has been placed on a\njudgment of this Court in the case of Hukam Singh versus Tara Singh\nand others, 1992 Civil Court Cases 771 (P & H). The contention\ncannot be accepted because the plaintiff-appellant has miserably\nfailed to prove his possession over the suit property. Oral statements\nRSA No.221 of 2006 (O & M) \n-3-\nof plaintiff and another witness examined by him are not sufficient to\nprove that the plaintiff-appellant is in possession of the suit property.\nThird witness examined by the plaintiff is only a Draftsman, who\nprepared the site plan. On the other hand, statements of plaintiff's\nwitnesses also stand rebutted by statements of the defendants'\nwitnesses. Thus plaintiff's evidence is not sufficient to prove that he\nis in possession of the suit land. Moreover, mere tethering of cattle\nor storing of manure as pleaded by the plaintiff would not depict that\nhe is in possession of the suit plot. \nLearned counsel for the appellant next contended that the\nlower appellate Court erroneously observed that plaintiff-appellant is\nnot owner of the suit property and in fact even the plaintiff appellant\nhas pleaded himself to be in possession thereof being Shamlat\nproperty. This contention also does not help the appellant because\npossession of vacant land is presumed to be of the owner. The\nevidence of plaintiff-appellant is not sufficient to prove that even\nwithout being owner of the suit land, he is in possession thereof. At\nthe risk of repetition, it has to be mentioned that mere acts of\ntethering of cattle etc. do not clothe the plaintiff appellant with\npossession of the suit land. The plaintiff has even failed to prove the\nsaid acts that he is tethering cattle and storing manure etc. in the suit\nland. \nLearned counsel for the appellant next contended that\ndefendants have failed to prove that the suit land was allotted to\npredecessor of defendant Nos.1 to 3 and has been sold by defendant\nNos.1 to 3 to defendant Nos.4 and 5. It was also pointed out that\nlearned lower appellate Court erroneously observed that defendant\nRSA No.221 of 2006 (O & M) \n-4-\nNos.4 and 5 are admittedly true owners of the suit land and the\nplaintiff appellant cannot seek injunction against them and earlier\ndefendant Nos.1 to 3 were true owners. It was contended that\nfinding of the trial Court on this aspect to the contrary has been\nreversed by lower appellate Court without recording any reasons.\nRelying on judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in M/s Nopany\nInvestment (P) Ltd. versus Santokh singh (HUF), 2008(2) Civil\nCourt Cases 300 (S.C.), learned counsel for the appellant contended\nthat first appellate Court ought to give reasons for reversing the\nfinding of the trial Court. The entire contention is misconceived and\ndevoid of merit. Irrespective of whether defendants or any of them\nare owners of the suit property or not, the plaintiff cannot succeed\nunless he proves his own possession over the suit property.\nHowever, the plaintiff has failed to prove his possession over the suit\nproperty and, therefore, he has been rightly non-suited by the Courts\nbelow. There is concurrent finding by both the Courts below holding\nthat plaintiff is not proved to be in possession of the suit property.\nThe said finding is based on proper appreciation of evidence and is\nsupported by cogent reasons. The said finding does not warrant\ninterference in second appeal. No question of law, much less\nsubstantial question of law, arises for determination in the instant\nsecond appeal. The appeal is found to be without any merit and is\naccordingly dismissed.\n.11.2010.\n ( L. N. MITTAL )\nA. Kaundal\nJUDGE"
