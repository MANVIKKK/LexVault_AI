  "judgment_text": "24.s.2459.1985.doc\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT BOMBAY\nORDINARY ORIGINAL CIVIL JURISDICTION\nSUIT NO. 2459 OF 1985\nHotel Airlines International\n.. Plaintiff\nVs.\nKakad Investments & Ors.\n.. Defendants\nMr. S.S. Deshmukh i/b Pravin B. Gole for the Plaintiff.\nMr. Swanand Chougule for Defendant No.1.\nMr. Dilip R. Talekar, Insolvency Registrar present in Court. \nCORAM : K.R. SHRIRAM, J.\nDATED : 7TH OCTOBER, 2016.\nP.C.\nThe Suit came to be settled by consent of the parties on 8th \nOctober 1985. Consent terms were drawn. A consent decree in terms of \nthe consent terms is passed. The consent decree states that it is to operate \nas a conveyance in favour of the Plaintiff.\nThe Consent Decree becomes a conveyance as defined under \nSection 2(g) (iii) of the Bombay Stamp Act, 1958, which runs thus :\n S.2(g) Conveyance includes, \n(i) \n(ii) \n(iii) Every decree or final order of any Civil Court.\n(iv) \nBy which property, whether movable or immovable, or any \nestate or\ninterest in any property is transferred to, or vested in, any \nother\nperson, inter vivos, and which is not otherwise specifically \nprovided\nfor by Schedule I .\nWaghmare 1/3\n.s.2459.1985.doc\nHence a consent decree passed pursuant to Consent Terms operates as a \ndecree of the court. The said definition came into force on 10th December \n,   pursuant   to   the   substitution   of   the   definition   for   the   previous \ndefinition by the Amendment Act of 1985.\nUpon the consent terms operating as a decree of the court and \nbeing termed a conveyance in favour of the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff derived \ntitle to the suit property. The Plaintiff as the owner of the suit property, \nacquired all the rights of ownership. The utilization and enjoyment of those \nrights require the original document of conveyance to be in the possession \nof the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff to be able to use the document to show his \ntitle.\nThis becomes essential more specially when the Plaintiff is \nrequired to transfer his title either by way of mortgage, sale, lease, etc, \nwhen the original document of title would be required to be handed over \nto the transferee.\nThe   Plaintiff   has   got   the   consent   decree   operating   as \nconveyance registered and stamped in accordance with Law. The Plaintiff is \nrequired to be returned the original document of title.\nWaghmare 2/3\n.s.2459.1985.doc\nAll original documents produced by parties are, as a matter of \npractice returned to them after the final judgment is pronounced and the \nsuit is disposed of. There is, therefore, no reason not to return the original \ndocument of title to the Plaintiff.\nFurther, this issue has been dealt with by a decision of this \nCourt  in  K.   Raheja  Corporation   Private   Limited   Vs   Mrs  Goolestan   Peter  \nCoelho and Others, where it was directed that a consent decree be handed \nover to the Plaintiff in that case.\nI also find support of an order dated 23.12.2015 passed in Suit \nNo.2225 of 1993. \nIn a matter such  as this,  therefore, the Plaintiff would be \nentitled to the return of the original consent decree. The office of the \nProthonotary and Senior Master shall make a certified copy of the consent \ndecree filed in the suit and operating as a conveyance to be kept on record \nof this suit and return the original decree to the Plaintiff within four weeks.\n(K.R. SHRIRAM, J.)\nWaghmare 3/3"
