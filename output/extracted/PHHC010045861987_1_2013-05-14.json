Petitioners\n\nVERSUS\nThe Joint Director Panchayats,\nPunjab and others\n\n ..... Respondents\n\nCORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJIVE BHALLA\n HON'BLE MRS. JUSTICE REKHA MITTAL\nPresent:\nMr.S.K.Pipat, Senior Advocate, with \nMr.Manoj Pundir, Advocate, for the petitioners.\nMs.Vandana Malhotra, Addl.A.G., Punjab,\nfor respondents No.1 and 2.\nMs.Alka Sarin, Advocate, for respondent No.3.\n\n *******\nRAJIVE BHALLA, J. (ORAL)\nThe petitioners pray for issuance of a writ of certiorari\nquashing order dated 14.10.1986, passed by the Joint Director,\nPanchayats, Punjab, exercising powers of the 'Commissioner' under the\nPunjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Act, 1961, (hereinafter\nreferred to as the  1961 Act ).\nThe controversy in the present petition is, whether the land,\nin dispute, which is recorded as the share of  Shamilat Patti  in\nShamilat Deh, vests in the Gram Panchayat under Section 2(g)(3) of the\nAct. A perusal of Section 2(g)(3) of the 1961 Act reveals that a\nperson or a Gram Panchayat claiming that land described as  Shamilat\nPatti  vests or does not vest in a Gram Panchayat, shall be required to\nCWP No.3422 of 1987\n -2-\nprove by a reference to the relevant revenue record that the land was or\nwas not used for benefit of the village community or part thereof, or for\ncommon purposes of the village.\nThe District Development and Panchayat Officer,\nRupnagar, exercising the powers of the Collector, has held that the\nGram Panchayat has failed to prove the ingredients of Section 2(g)(3)\nof the 1961 Act and dismissed the petition filed by the Gram\nPanchayat. The Joint Director, Panchayats, Punjab, exercising the\npowers of the 'Commissioner', has, however, reversed the order passed\nby the Collector but without recording any finding in terms of Section\n(g)(3) of the 1961 Act.\nCounsel for the parties agree, on instructions from their\nrespective parties, that the writ petition may be allowed, the impugned\norder may be set aside and the matter may be remitted to the Director\nPanchayats, Punjab, Chandigarh, to decide the appeal afresh and in\naccordance with law.\nIn view of agreement between counsel for the parties, the\nwrit petition is allowed, the impugned order dated 14.10.1986 is set\naside and the matter is remitted to the Director Panchayats, Punjab,\nChandigarh, to decide the appeal afresh and in accordance with law\nwithin three months of parties putting in appearance before him on\n.07.2013.\n The Director Panchayats, Punjab, Chandigarh, shall grant\nan opportunity to both parties to lead additional evidence so as to\nCWP No.3422 of 1987\n -3-\nadduce relevant revenue record to prove their respective pleas.\nDuring pendency of the appeal, parties shall maintain status\nquo with respect to ownership, possession and the nature of the land, in\ndispute.\n\n [ RAJIVE BHALLA ]\n\n JUDGE\n.05.2013\n\n [ REKHA MITTAL ]\nshamsher\n\n JUDGE"
