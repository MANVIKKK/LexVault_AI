JUSTICE AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH\n* * *\nPresent :\nMr. Bikram Chaudhary, Advocate\nfor the petitioner.\nMr. D.S.Nalwa, Addl. A.G. Haryana,\nfor the respondents.\n* * *\nAUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. (ORAL)\nPrayer in the present writ petition is for issuance of a writ in the\nnature of mandamus directing the respondents-State of Haryana to give\nthe benefit of revision of pay scale to the petitioner as given to the HCMS\n(Doctors) and Engineers vide notification dated 02.06.1989\n(Annexure P-1).\nIt is the claim of the petitioner that he was appointed on the\npost of Transport Officer in the Department of Health, Government of\nHaryana. The qualification prescribed for appointment to the post of \nCWP No. 17346 of 1991 \nTransport Officer was Matric with certificate or diploma in Mechanical or\nAutomobile Engineering with 5 years (3 years for diploma holders)\ntechnical and administrative experience in the State Transport or in\nAutomobile Workshop with adequate knowledge of Hindi or Punjabi. On\nthe basis of these qualifications, it has been asserted by the petitioner that\nhe belongs to the category of Engineers. It has further been pleaded that\nthe petitioner is entitled to the equation of the post of Transport Officer with\nthat of Engineer as initially, when the petitioner was appointed, the pay\nscale of the post, which the petitioner was holding, was higher than that of\nthe Engineers but subsequently with the revision of pay scale w.e.f.\n.04.1979, the pay scale of the post held by the petitioner has been kept\nlower than those of the degree holder Engineers. From 01.01.1986, the\npetitioner was granted the pay scale of Rs. 2000-3500 whereas the\nEngineers also were granted the same scale but subsequently w.e.f.\n.05.1989, after a period of 5 years of regular service, the pay scale has\nbeen fixed at Rs. 3000-4500 and after 12 years, it would be Rs. 4100-\n. On the basis of these, the petitioner is claiming that he is entitled to\nthe scale of Rs. 3000-4500 after 5 years of regular service and Rs. 4100-\nafter 12 years of regular service. This claim of the petitioner is\nprimarily based on the analogy that he belongs to the category of\nEngineers and, therefore, would be entitled to the same benefit.\nOn the other hand, the respondents have taken a specific\nstand that the post of Transport Officer was never equated with that of an\nEngineer. The petitioner is holding a diploma in Engineering whereas he is\nclaiming the benefit of equation of pay with that of degree holder\nEngineers. The petitioner was placed in the pay scale of Rs. 2000-3500\nw.e.f. 01.01.1986 but as a measure personal to him and taking a \nCWP No. 17346 of 1991 \nlenient view, the petitioner has been granted the scale of Rs. 2200-4000/-\nw.e.f. 01.10.1991. It has further been pleaded that the nature of duties,\nresponsibilities, qualifications of the post of the petitioner and that of the\nEngineers, is totally different nor has there ever been an equation of these\nposts, thus, dis-entitling the petitioner to the claim, which has been made\nby him in the writ petition. It has further been stated that the pay scale of\nthe petitioner became same as that of the Engineers because of the\nbunching of various pay scales when the revision of the pay scales took\nplace.\nCounsel for the petitioner submits that as the petitioner holds\nthe minimum qualification, which requires a diploma in Automobile\nEngineering, therefore, for all intents and purposes, he should be treated\nas an Engineer and thus, entitled to the pay scale, which has been granted\nto the Engineers vide notification dated 02.06.1989.\nOn the other hand, counsel for the respondents submits that\nthe notification dated 02.06.1989 (Annexure P-1), reliance whereof has\nbeen made by the petitioner, is specifically applicable only to the Doctors\nand Engineers. Merely because the petitioner holds the diploma in\nAutomobile Engineering, does not entitle him the benefit of the post of an\nEngineer, especially when there is no equation of the said post and further\nthat the qualifications, responsibilities and duties are different. He further\ncontends that it is not a function of the Court to equate the post or grant\nequation of pay scales, which should be left to the Expert Bodies and the\nExecutives. In support of this contention, he relies upon a judgment of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. vs. J.P.Chaurasia,\n(1) SCC 121.\nI have heard the counsel for the parties and have gone\nthrough the records of the case.\nCWP No. 17346 of 1991 \nIt is not in dispute that the qualifications, duties, responsibilities\nand the work performed by the petitioner and the Engineers is different.\nThere has never been an equation of the two posts nor has the post of\nTransport Officer ever been declared as a post of an Engineer. That being\nso, the notification dated 02.06.1989 would not be applicable to the\npetitioner. Further, the pay scale and the post also can be equated by an\nExpert Body which the Court should refrain from performing the role unless\nthere is overwhelming evidence on record in this regard. Generally, it\nshould be left open to the Executives to perform the said responsibility.\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of State of U.P. vs. J.P.Chaurasia\n(supra) has also held on similar lines.\nIn view of the above, finding no merit in the present writ\npetition, the same stands dismissed.\nAugust 18, 2010\n\n(AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH )\npj\n\n JUDGE"
