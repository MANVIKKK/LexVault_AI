    "the Petitioner were resolved and Minutes were filed on 2nd December 1992. . Despite these minutes, it appears that the Petition remained pending since certain office objections had not been removed. While it remained in that state, a second Caveat was filed on the very same Testamentary Petition No. 494 of 1989. This resulted in that very Petition being once again renumbered, this time as Testamentary Suit No. 56 of 1995. Thus, the position was that in a single Testamentary Petition propounding one Will, there were two contested actions each separately numbered as a Suit. . The Caveator in the first Testamentary Suit No. 72 of 1989 then filed Suit No. 3255 of 1995 seeking to have the Minutes of the order dated 2nd December 1992 set aside. .
