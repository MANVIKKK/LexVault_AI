In the matter of \nNav Bharat Trading Co. Ltd. (in liqn.)]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOffice Notes, Office Memoranda of Coram, \n Court's or Judge's orders\nappearances, Court's orders of directions\nand Registrar's orders\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMr. Shriniwas V. Deshpande, Advocate for the Official Liquidator with Mr. Deepak\nPersoya, Official Liquidator\nCORAM :\nANIL L. PANSARE, J.\nDATE :\n-03-2025\nOn 21-3-2025, following order was passed. \n Heard.\n. \nThe Laxmi Bank Limited has filed this petition with\nfollowing prayers.\n(a) \nThat the company be ordered to be would up by\nthis Honourable Court under the provisions of the\nCompanies Act, 1956;\n(b) \nThe Official Liquidator or some other fit and proper\nperson be appointed as the Official Liquidator with all\npowers under the  . \n. \nThe Laxmi Bank Ltd. has averred that the company\nby name, Gopaldas Mohatta & Company Limited was\nincorporated at Nagpur on 25.05.1941. The name of the\ncompany was later on changed to  Navbharat Trading\nCompany Private Limited  (company under liquidation), in the\nmeeting of shareholders dated 28.07.1947. The authorized\ncapital of the company was Rs.10,00,000/- and the subscribed\nand issued capital was Rs.1,61,200/-. The company had\nmultiple objects including trading, financing, etc. It appears\nthat the company had issued three cheques to Laxmi\nInvestment Company Pvt. Ltd., total amounting to\nRs.1,35,000/-. It further appears that Laxmi Investment\nCompany Ltd. had a current account with the petitioner  \nbank at Bombay, Fort Branch. The aforesaid three cheques\nwere presented by Laxmi Investment Company Ltd., which\nwere returned with remark,  Refer to drawer . According to\nthe petitioner, the Company did not have sufficient funds in its\n:BHC-NAG:3212\n(2) cmp 8.1961\naccount with the said branch. The petitioner bank, however,\npaid the amount of the aforesaid three cheques drawn on\ncompany s account with an assumption that the amount of\ncheques deposited by the company in its account would be\nmet. According to the petitioner, the amount, that was payable\nby the company under liquidation was to the tune of\nRs.1,14,000/- and accordingly on 18.07.1961, the liquidator\nof the petitioner company addressed a notice of payment to\nNavbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd., calling upon the\ncompany to pay the sum of Rs.1,14,000/-. The envelope\ncontaining notice was, however, not accepted by the company\nunder liquidation.\n. \nI am informed that not only the company under\nliquidation i.e. Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. but also\nthe other company, Laxmi Investment Company Pvt. Ltd. and\nLaxmi Bank are under liquidation. In addition, a company\nnamely, National Commercial Corporation Ltd. was also under\nliquidation in Company Petition No.9/1961, which came to be\ndissolved by this Court vide order dated 09.06.2022.\n. \nThus, what remains is the three other companies\nwhich are subject matter of Company Petition No.8/1961\n(present petition) in respect of Navbharat Trading Company\nPvt. Ltd., Company Petition No.12/1961 in respect of Laxmi\nInvestment Co. Ltd. and Company Petition No.14/1960 in\nrespect of Laxmi Bank Ltd., the proceeding being initiated by\nthe Reserve Bank of India. The winding up proceedings\nagainst Laxmi Investment Company Ltd. have been initiated\nby Laxmi Bank.\n. \nThus, it appears that Laxmi Investment Company\nLtd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. were holding\naccounts with Laxmi Bank. It further appears that some\nfinancial benefits were extended by Laxmi Bank to Laxmi\nInvestment Company Ltd. and Navbharat Trading Company\nPvt. Ltd and accordingly Laxmi Bank proceeded to file\nliquidation proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company\nLtd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd. however, prior\nthereto Laxmi Bank itself was subject matter of winding up\nproceeding at the instance of the Reserve Bank of India. That\nappears to be the reason why Liquidator of Laxmi Bank has\nfiled the proceedings against Laxmi Investment Company Pvt.\nLtd. and Navbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd.\n(3) cmp 8.1961\n. \nComing back to the present proceeding, the Official\nLiquidator submits that as on 31.12.2024, Navbharat Trading\nCompany Pvt. Ltd. has no assets except one fixed deposit of\nRs.1,48,117/-. The Official Liquidator submits that there are\ntwo creditors. One is Laxmi Bank, for Rs.3,60,000/- another is\nSales Tax Department, Akola for Rs.36,357/-. Mr. Deshpande,\nlearned counsel for the Official Liquidator, submits that the\nclaim of Laxmi Bank will have to be processed first, in terms of\nSection 529 of the Companies Act, 1956 and since the amount\nlying to the credit of the company is not sufficient to pay the\nentire amount of Laxmi Bank, the Company under liquidation\nis not in a position to pay dues to the Sales Tax Department,\nAkola.\n. \nThe Official Liquidator, however, seeks further time\nto verify whether there are any other assets belonging to\nNavbharat Trading Company Pvt. Ltd.\nStand over to 28.03.2025. \nAs could be seen, Laxmi Bank Limited has initiated the present\npetition. The amount due and payable to Laxmi Bank Limited is/was\nRs. 1,14,000/-. \n.\nThe Official Liquidator submits that there are no assets of\nNavbharat Trading Company Private Limited. He submits that the\namount of Rs. 1,48,117/- is, however, lying to the credit of company\nand accordingly, seeks permission to pay the amount to Laxmi Bank\nLimited after adjusting amount towards administrative and other\nexpenses. Permission granted. The amount be paid within two\nweeks from today. \n.\n The Official Liquidator shall pay to Laxmi Bank Limited\nthe amount which is lying to its credit after meeting administrative\nand other expenses.\n.\n The Official Liquidator submits that upon doing aforesaid\nexercise, nothing would remain with Navbharat Trading Company\nPrivate Limited to continue with liquidation proceedings and hence\n(4) cmp 8.1961\nrequest is made to dissolve the company under Section 481 of the\nCompanies Act, 1956.\n.\nThus, it appears that the Official Liquidator cannot\nproceed with the winding up of the company for want of fund and\nasset. It is thus just and reasonable to order dissolution of the\ncompany in terms of Section 481 of the Companies Act. Hence,\nfollowing order is passed. \nORDER\n(i)\nCompany named  Navbharat Trading Company Private\nLimited  stands dissolved in terms of Section 481(1) of the\nCompanies Act, 1956 subject to compliance of direction in paragraph\nno. 2 of the order.\n(ii) \nThe Official Liquidator shall forward copy of order to the\nRegistrar of Companies in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 481 of\nthe Companies Act.\n(iii) \nThe Official Liquidator shall file report of payment of dues\nto the Registrar(Judicial) of this Court within two weeks from today. \n(iv) \nThe company petition is disposed of in above terms.\n (Anil L.
