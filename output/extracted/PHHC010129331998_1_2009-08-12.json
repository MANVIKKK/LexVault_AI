  "judgment_text": "Crl.Revn. No.962 of 1998\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT\nCHANDIGARH\n\n Crl.Revn. No.962 of 1998\n Date of Decision:12.8.2009\n\nZile Singh\n\n petitioner \n Versus \n\nFood Inspector, Narwana District Jind (Haryana)\n\n Respondent \n\nCORAM: HON BLE MR.JUSTICE HARBANS LAL\n\nPresent: Mr.Ankur Malik, Advocate for the petitioner \n\nMr.Amit Kaushik, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana \n\nJUDGMENT \n\nHARBANS LAL, J. \nThis revision is directed against the judgment dated 8.7.1999\npassed by the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge (I), Jind whereby\nhe dismissed the appeal filed by Zile Singh accused against the\njudgment/order of sentence dated 11.12.1997 rendered by the court of Sub\nDivisional Judicial Magistrate, Narwana, vide which he convicted and\nsentenced the aforesaid accused to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a\nperiod of one year and to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- under Section 16(1)(a)(i)\nread with Section 7 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954 (for\nbrevity  the Act ) and in default of payment of the fine, to further undergo\nrigorous imprisonment for a period of three months.\nThe facts in brief of the prosecution are that Govt. Food\nInspector Khushi Ram Gambhir accompanied by Dr. R.S.Khatri inspected\nthe premises of accused Zile Singh near Laxmi Cinema Narwana on\nCrl.Revn. No.962 of 1998\n.2.1990 at 2.30 P.M. and he was found in possession of about 2 kgs. of\npaneer (Cheese) for public sale contained in an Aluminum tray. The\naforesaid Inspector also joined PW Madan Lal as a witness. After giving a\nnotice Ex.PA, the aforesaid Inspector demanded a sample of paneer.\nThereafter, he purchased 750 grams paneer from the accused on payment of\nRs.24/- vide receipt Ex.PB. The usual formalities were observed. The\ncertificate Ex.PE was issued by Public Analyst Haryana Chandigarh, in\nwhich it was opined that the sample of paneer was found to be adulterated.\nThen the aforesaid Inspector lodged a complaint. \nAfter recording pre-charge evidence, the accused was charged\nunder Section 16(1)(a)(i) read with Section 7 of the Act, to which he did not\nplead guilty and claimed trial. \nThe learned trial Magistrate after recording the prosecution\nevidence and statement of the accused under Section 313 of Cr.P.C. and\nafter hearing the Government Food Inspector for the State, learned defence\ncounsel and examining the evidence on record, convicted and sentenced the\naccused as noticed at the outset. Feeling aggrieved with his\nconviction/sentence, the petitioner preferred an appeal, which was also\ndismissed by the court of learned Additional Sessions Judge, Jind. Being\nundaunted and dissatisfied with the judgments rendered by both the courts\nbelow, he has preferred this revision. \nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties, besides\nperusing the record with due care and circumspection.\nRealising that he would not be able to persuade this court to\ntake a view contrary to the findings returned by both the courts below, the\nCrl.Revn. No.962 of 1998\nlearned counsel for the petitioner submitted that he does not wish to assail\nthe conviction. On analysing and scrutinizing the evidence on record, it is\nfound that the judgments recorded by both the courts below cannot be\nfaulted with in any manner. Sequelly, conviction is maintained. At this\njuncture, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the petitioner \nhas been facing the agony of trial since 1990 and that being so, his sentence\nmay be reduced to the already undergone. \nI have given a deep and thoughtful consideration to this\nsubmission. Needless to say, this incident is more than 19 years old. As per\nthe custody certificate, taken on record, the petitioner has undergone 2\nmonths and 10 days of the actual sentence. In re:Sadhu Singh versus State\nof Punjab, 2004(1) Recent Criminal Reports (Criminal) 108, the accused\nwas convicted under Section 326 of IPC. The occurrence being 18 years old,\nthe sentence was reduced to the already undergone (one month). An\nidentical view has also been taken in re: Nirmal Singh Versus State of\nPunjab 2005(1) Recent Criminal Reports (Crl.) 477. The petitioner has\nbeen facing the agony of trial since 1990. He has suffered both financial and\nmental agony on account of protracted trial. In my view, the ends of justice\nwould be sufficiently met, if while maintaining the conviction, the sentence\nimposed upon the petitioner is reduced to the already undergone (2 months\nand 10 days). Accordingly, it is reduced to the already undergone (2 months\nand 10 days). \n\nth August, 2009 (Harbans Lal)\ngsv Judge \n\nWhether to be referred to the Reporter ? Yes/No."
