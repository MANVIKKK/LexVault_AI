Petitioner\nv.\nHaryana State Electricity Board and others, \n...... Respondents. \n***\nCORAM : HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE AJAY TEWARI\n***\nPresent :\nMr. Dinesh Kumar, Advocate \nfor the petitioner. \nMr. Narinder Hooda, Advocate \nfor the respondents.\n***\n. Whether Reporters of Local Newspapers may be allowed to see the\n judgment ?\n. To be referred to the Reporters or not ?\n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest ?\n***\nAJAY TEWARI, J (Oral)\nBy this writ petition, the petitioner claims that he should be\ngranted pay for two years Special Engineering Degree Course which he\ncleared as an inservice candidate. \nIt is not disputed that when the petitioner applied for study\nleave, there was no policy governing the conditions thereof. Leave was\ngranted to the petitioner to pursue the course on the execution of an\naffidavit from him wherein he mentioned as follows :-\nC.W.P\n\n No. 2106 of 1990\n\n::2:: \n  1.\nThat all the expenses would have to bear by me.\n.\nThat I will serve the Board for a period of 2 years\nafter acquiring higher qualification.\n.\nThat I will not claim any benefit except those\ngiven by the Board from time to time as a result of higher\nqualification.\n.\nThat for study period I will apply leave which will\nbe at liberty of the Board for consideration on merit. \nSubsequently, the respondents formulated a policy to govern\nthe conditions for grant of paid study leave. Condition No.1 thereof was to\nthe following effect :-\n  i)\nThe candidate seeking admission in the Degree\nCourse should have atleast 5 years Regular Service in the\nBoard. \nSince on the date of applying, the petitioner did not qualify the\nabove mentioned condition, his prayer was declined. At that stage, the\npetitioner filed CWP No.12431 of 1989, which was disposed of with a\ndirection to the respondents to pass a speaking order. Even in the speaking\norder dated 12.1.1990, it has been mentioned that since the petitioner does\nnot fulfill the essential qualification of having 5 years regular service, the\nbenefit of paid leave cannot be granted to him. The case of another person\nwhich was relied upon by the petitioner was distinguished on the ground\nthat such person had five years service to his credit. \nCounsel for the petitioner has laid stress particularly on para 3\nof the policy which is to the following effect :-\n  3.\nThe above decision of the Board would also be\napplicable to the officials, who have joined a regular\ncourse. \nAs per the counsel for the petitioner, under para 3 the petitioner\nwould be covered, since he had already joined the regular course. \nHowever, counsel for the respondents states that the said para 3\nC.W.P\n\n No. 2106 of 1990\n\n::3:: \nwould be applicable to those officials who may have joined prior to the\npolicy and fulfilled the condition and that it would not enure to the benefit\nof the petitioner. \nIn my opinion, the argument of counsel for the respondents has\nto be accepted. It cannot be lost sight of that on the date the petitioner\napplied, there was no provision for grant of paid study leave. The petitioner\nwas granted study leave on the basis of the affidavit sworn by him. In the\ncircumstances, he cannot be held to be entitled to the benefit of the policy. \nCounsel for the petitioner has further argued that since the\npredominant factor of the policy is that study leave benefits not only the\nemployee but the employer also, such a pedantic interpretation should not\nbe given. He has laid stress particularly on the fact that since the passing of\nthe course, the petitioner has been in service of the respondents and, thus,\nthe benefit of his acquiring higher professional qualification has definitely\nenriched his job profile. He further states that even in the policy, the\nsafeguard incorporated by the respondents is that the person will undertake\nto serve the respondents for a period of five years after finishing the Course\n(so that due benefit of his higher qualification can be derived by the\nrespondents). As per the learned counsel, the petitioner has been in service\nof the Board throughout and, thus, he has fulfilled the condition of not only\nfive years service but more than two decades of service. \nIn my opinion, this argument of counsel for the petitioner\nwould not be the determinative, as the Court is mindful of the fact that the\ncondition to which the petitioner subjected himself was only two years\nservice. As per his affidavit, he could have left the service after two years\nC.W.P\n\n No. 2106 of 1990\n\n::4:: \nand the respondents could have raised no grievance against it. \nCounsel for the petitioner has further argued that para 3, quoted\nabove, makes it clear that the condition of five years service is only\nprospective in nature and cannot be retrospectively applied to those persons\nwho have already availed the benefit. He has also argued that once the\nname of the petitioner was sponsored he could not be denied the benefit. \nAs regards the first argument, it cannot be accepted for the\nsimple reason that prior to the policy there was no provision relating to the\ngrant of paid study leave. Thus, there is no question of adjustment or any\nretrospectivity to this stipulation. As regards the second argument, the same\ncan be disposed of by observing that right to unpaid study leave is totally\ndifferent to the right of paid study leave and merely because the petitioner\nhad been sponsored for study leave, which at that time could not be paid\nstudy leave (for want of any policy in this regard), it did not entitle him to\nclaim right that his sponsorship was under the new policy. \nConsequently, finding no merit in this writ petition, the same is\ndismissed with no order as to costs. \n\n ( AJAY TEWARI )\nNovember 29, 2010. \n JUDGE\n`kk'"
