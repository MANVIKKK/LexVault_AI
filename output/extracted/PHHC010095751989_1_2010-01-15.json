Petitioner\nVersus\nUnion of India and others\n........ Respondents\nCORAM: \nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN\nPresent:-\nMr. H. S. Saini, Advocate\nfor the petitioners.\nMs. Lisa Gill, Advocate \nfor the respondents.\n****\nK. Kannan, J (oral).\n.\nThe writ petitioners who were Junior Assistants\nposted as Readers in the subordinate judiciary challenge the reduction of\npay scales and recoveries sought to be made when through the\nproceedings of the Government of Punjab, Department of Finance,\nnotification issued on 19.5.1998, the government had decided to amend\nthe Second Schedule to the Punjab Civil Service Revised Pay First\nAmendment Rules of 1998. The amendment was issued to take effect from\n.1.1996 retrospectively.\n.\nThe petitioners' complaint is that they had been\nworking as ministerial staff as Senior Clerks and Junior Assistants who\nwere put on time scale of Rs.1500-2700 and after 1.1.1996 the scales had\nbeen revised and assigned to the scale of Rs.5000-8100. By the impugned\nproceedings through an office order dated 13.9.1999, the junior assistants\nwere put in the time scale of Rs.4400-7000 w.e.f. 1.1.1996. This resulted in\na reduction of scale of pay for persons who had drawn a higher pay when\nCWP No.14922 of 1999\nthe scales were revised to 5000-8100. When the revision of scales had\ntaken place, it was reduced from Rs.5000-8100 to 4400-7000 and no pay\nprotection had been given to them unlike other classes of persons to whom\nsuch protection was given. According to the petitioner the retrospective\nreduction of scale without protecting the pay which they were drawing was\narbitrary. It also discriminated when certain other classes of persons, who\nlike the Duplicating Machine Operators, belonging to the operational staff\nhad been given pay protection when the scale of pay had been reduced.\nSimilarly even in the National Training Institute the craft instructors were\ngiven pay protection by applying it uniformly to all persons, whether\npromoted before or after 1.1.1996.\n.\n All the petitioners are persons who had been\npromoted after 1.1.1996 and who had obtained the higher revised scale but\nwhen the revision of scale had been made to a lower scale the higher\nsalary drawn was not protected. Learned counsel for the petitioner refers\nto a judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chairman Railway Board\nand others Vs. C.R. Rangadhamaiah and others (1997) 6 SCC 623 that\ndealt with the case of effect of retrospective amendment withdrawing\nvested or accrued rights of government employees. The Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt held that any retrospective amendment which has the effect of taking\naway an accrued right of an employee would be liable to be struck down.\nLearned counsel also refers to a situation of 10 other employees similarly\nplaced, who were working as Junior Assistants in various other\ndepartments like Colleges in U.T.Administration, Chandigarh and who\nwere afforded the pay protection while retrospective application of scale of\npay was sought to be made through an intervention of order of the Central\nAdministrative Tribunal in OA No. 316/CH/2001 by its order dated\n.3.2003. According to him, the petitioners could not have any relief\nbefore CAT only because they were members of the judiciary and therefore\nCWP No.14922 of 1999\nthey have sought relief before this Court and they should also enjoy the\nsame relief as the persons similarly situated.\n.\nThe office order, while reducing the scales of pay\nto Rs.4400-7000 against the existing scale of Rs.5000-8100 could not have\nrestricted the benefit of pay protection only to persons who had been\npromoted even before 1.1.1996. If the revision of pay scales had not been\nbrought immediately on 1.1.1996 and all the petitioners had been provided\nfor higher scales from 1.1.1996 an office order that was brought on\n.9.1999 could not deny such protection to persons who had been\npromoted subsequently on 1.1.1996 and who had received the higher\nscales. The revised scale of Rs.4400-7000 should be applied only after\nproviding for protection of salary at the scale which they were drawing.\nAccordingly, the impugned office order under Annexure P-1 is quashed.\n.\nThe writ petition is allowed with protection granted\nas aforesaid. There shall, however, be no order as to costs.\n(K. KANNAN)\n JUDGE \nDecember 15 , 2009\narchana"
