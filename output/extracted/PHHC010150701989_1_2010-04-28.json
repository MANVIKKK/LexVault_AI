JUSTICE K. KANNAN\n------\nPresent: Mr. Rahul Sharma, Advocate, for the petitioners.\n(in CWP No.4421 of 1989)\nNone for the petitioners in \nCWP Nos.16737 and 17084 of 1989.\nMr. Sanjay Kaushal, Senior Standing Counsel, for the \nChandigarh Administration.\nNone for respondents 5, 6 and 8.\nMr.Manohal Lall, Additional Advocate General, Punjab, for \nrespondent No.7.\n-----\nCivil Writ Petition No.4421 of 1989\n- 2 -\n.\nWhether reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the \njudgment? \n.\nTo be referred to the reporters or not? \n.\nWhether the judgment should be reported in the digest? \n-----\nK.Kannan, J (Oral)\n.\nThe petitioners are owners of the property in SCO Nos.70 to\nin Sector 17-D, Chandigarh. The final order of resumption in\nchallenge is the one passed by the Advisor to the Administrator\nrecording the fact that the violations which had been pointed out, had not\nbeen removed and, therefore, the property was liable for resumption.\n.\nThe contention of the petitioners was that some of the\nviolations which had been pointed out, could not be removed in view of\nthe properties being in the possession of the tenants, who had taken\nindependent pleas complaining that the land owners were colluding with\nthe administration to oust them from possession by deliberately suffering\nan order of eviction. All the tenants in possession have been cited as\nrespondents 6 to 8. The petitioners and the tenants have a common\nground to canvass at the time when the writ petition is finally taken up to\nurge that the deviations which had been pointed out and which were\ntaken as a basis for actions for resumption have since ceased or become\ncompoundable. At the time when the order of resumption had been\npassed, the following violations had been pointed out:-\n 1.\nDirect entry to basement from public verandah has\nbeen provided which is not as per sanctioned plan.\n.\nAdditional partitions is also done there.\n.\nBig show windows in right side verandah have been\ndivided into small show windows.\n.\nStair position from right side verandah is shifted at\nthe back verandah against the plans and instead of round\nsquare pills are constructed. \nCivil Writ Petition No.4421 of 1989\n- 3 -\nOf the above 5 items of deviations, item No.2 refers to a conversion and\ndivision of a kitchen into a toilet and a small shop with entry from public\nverandah. The 2nd respondent has given an affidavit stating that the\nsecond violation had been removed and he had given an undertaking that\nhe will pay the necessary compounding fee for violations 1, 3, 4 and 5\nreferred to above. Having regard to the subsequent event and the change\nof regulations relating to some of the deviations as compoundable, the\norder of resumption is set aside and the administration shall be at liberty\nto make an inspection of the property and ensure that deviation No.2\ncomplained of has since been removed as affirmed in the affidavit. The\nadministration shall be at liberty to assess the compounding fee as\npermissible under rules and make a demand specifying the amounts and\nthe petitioners shall be bound to make the payment. Any default on their\npart will result in the consequences which the regulations provide for.\nThe writ petition is allowed on the above terms. The affidavit given by\nShri Mohan Singh, is taken on record and shall form part of the record. \nCivil Writ Petition Nos.16737 and 17084 of 1989\n.\nIn these two writ petitions, the petitiones are the tenants of\nthe very same premises i.e. SCO Nos.70 to 72 in Sector 17-D,\nChandigarh and the benefit of cancellation of the resumption order\nwould avail to the benefit of the petitioners also. The writ petitions filed\nby them are also allowed on the above terms. \n`\n(K.KANNAN)\n JUDGE\n.04.2010\nsanjeev"
