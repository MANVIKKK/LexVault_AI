Petitioner\nVersus\nThe State of Punjab and others\n........Respondents\nCORAM: \nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN\nPresent:-\nMr. Hazara Singh, Petitioner in person.\nMr. K. S. Sibia, DAG., Punjab.\n****\n.\nWhether reporters of local papers may be allowed \nto see the judgment ? No\n.\nTo be referred to the reporters or not? No\n.\nWhether the judgment should be reported in the \ndigest?No\nK. Kannan, J (oral).\n.\nBy an order dated 1.8.1991 when the above\nreview application in the writ petition filed in the year 1987 came up for\nhearing this Court had observed that the issue for review will be taken up\nsubsequent to the decision in CWP No. 8486 of 1990. The said writ\npetition has been disposed of on 13.1.1994 where the Court has held that\nCorporation was bound to make allotment of industrial plots to the\npetitioners as per the terms and conditions mentioned in the letters of\nallotment. The Bench has also given the liberty to the Corporation to claim\nadditional price in the plot on account of enhancement of compensation\nunder the Land Acquisition Act. The review is sought on the basis that he\nCWP No.6698 of 1987\nwas not a party to the writ petition. The cancellation of allotment of plots\nhad a direct bearing to his own right, he being an allottee. The petitioner\ncannot any longer be aggrieved since through the decision of CWP No.\nof 1987 the Court has held that the cancellation of allotment would be\nineffective and has directed the allotment. \n.\nThe review application is disposed of as\nunnecessary in view of the judgment quashing the order of cancellation of\nallotment in CWP No. 8486 of 1990. The petitioner is present in Court and\nstates that he is not aware of even cancellation of allotments. Any right\nwhich the petitioner has will follow the directions given by this Court already\nin CWP No. 3310 of 1990.\n(K. KANNAN)\n JUDGE \nApril 21 , 2011\narchana"
