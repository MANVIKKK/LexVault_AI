No.1559 of 1983\nDate of Decision. 04.11.2011\n\nJoginder Singh son of Mastan Singh and others\n.....Appellants\nVersus\n\nPunjab State through District Collector, Sangrur and others \n.....Respondents \nPresent: None for the appellant.\nNone for the State.\nMr. Vijay Pal, Advocate \nfor respondent No.2.\nNone for respondents No.3 to 5.\nCORAM:HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN\n. Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the\njudgment ? Yes/No\n. \nTo be referred to the Reporters or not ? Yes/No\n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? Yes/No\n-.-\nK. KANNAN J.\n.\nThere is no representation on behalf of the appellants.\nLearned counsel for the respondents is present and ready. Having\nregard to the fact that the appeal is of the year 1983 and it is identified\nby this Court on the administrative side as one of the oldest cases to be\ntaken up immediately for disposal on merits, I proceed to dispose of the\ncase on the basis of records and with the assistance of counsel for the\nrespondents on merits.\n.\nThe plaintiffs, who had filed the suit for declaration lost at the\ntrial Court as well as the Appellate Court. They are in appeal before\nthis Court assailing the decisions. The suit was for a declaration that\nthe order passed by the District Collector Sangrur on 26.07.1969\nR.S.A. No.1559 of 1983\n-2-\nallotting the property measuring 5 bighas 5 biswas in Khasra No.1387 in\nvillage Chaunda in favour of Bhag Singh arrayed as the defendant was\nvoid and for a permanent injunction restraining Bhag Singh from, in any\nmanner, interfering with the plaintiffs' possession. It must be\nimmediately noticed that the suit for declaration as referred to in the\npreamble of the plaint is distinct from the way the prayer column is\ncouched in paragraph 12, where the declaration sought is that the\ncancellation of allotment of land made in favour of the plaintiffs' was\nvoid and for an injunction restraining the defendants from interfering\nwith the possession. The inconsistency could be reconciled only by the\nfact that admittedly the property was the subject of allotment in the\nyear 1961 under Nazool Land Transfer Rules, 1956 by the Deputy\nCommissioner (Collector) Sangrur on 15.06.1961 and the plaintiffs\nthemselves had made reference to the fact that this allotment had been\ncancelled subsequently on 13.07.1978. The plaintiff is contending that\nthis cancellation was void ab initio since the same has been passed\nagainst the principles of natural justice. The subsequent allotment\nmade in favour of the 2nd defendant was, therefore, contended to be not\nvalid and the plaintiffs had sought for restraint against them from\ninterfering with the plaintiffs' possession.\n.\nThe State remained ex parte and gave no reason as to how the\nproceedings were initiated for cancellation of allotment in the year 1978\nand how a fresh allotment was made in favour of the 2nd defendant. The\nCourts below, however, held that there was no proof that the property\nhad been even allotted in favour of the plaintiffs and that possession of\nthe property had been handed over to the plaintiffs. The Court also\nR.S.A. No.1559 of 1983\n-3-\nfound that there had been a cancellation of order of allotment and the\nplaintiff could not file a suit without challenging the cancellation itself.\nA mere characterization of the cancellation as void cannot be a ground\nfor upholding the claim for injunction against the defendant. The suit is\ncontested only by the legal representatives of the private respondents in\nwhose favour the subsequent allotment was made.\n.\nOn the basis of pleadings, the following substantial questions\nof law arise for consideration.\n(i) whether the Courts below were justified in dismissing the\nplaintiffs' suit rested on alleged allotment in favour of the\nplaintiffs by the State on 15.06.1961 on the ground that the\nallotment had not been proved when the action of the\nState or functionaries must be presumed to be valid as an\nofficial act unless there are valid grounds brought by the\nState to justify the cancellation of allotment?\n(ii) whether the alleged cancellation of allotment in favour of\nthe plaintiff purported to have been done on 13.07.1978\nlegal and void?\n(iii)whether the State is entitled to assign the property through\nan allotment in favour of the 2nd defendant?\n(iv) whether the allotment of the property in favour of the 2nd\ndefendant-Bhag Singh valid to entitle the allottee to\ndisplace the claim of the plaintiffs in respect of the\ndisputed property?\n.\nOn the first point of whether the allotment made in favour of\nthe plaintiffs made on 15.06.1961 could have been cancelled, I find that\neven the alleged letter of allotment is not produced before the Court.\nThe relevant Rules themselves show that transfer of Nazool Lands under\nRule 3 could be made to a Cooperative Society comprising of persons\nbelonging to Scheduled Castes family. Rule 9-A of Nazool Land Transfer\nRules of 1956 reads as follows:-\nR.S.A. No.1559 of 1983\n-4-\n 9(A)(i): The arrears of instalments due under these rules shall\nbe recoverable as arrears of land revenue.\n(ii) In case of Cooperative Society/individual member\nconsistently makes default in making payment of two\ninstalments of price of Nazool land, the Collector may review\nthe case and cancel the allotment of land to the cooperative\nsociety/individual member whereupon the land shall revert to\nGovernment.\n(iii) The cooperative society/individual member concerned\nmay file an appeal to the Commissioner against the Collector's\norder within sixty days of the date of that order, and the\nCommissioner's order passed in appeal shall be final. \n.\nIn this case, the cancellation of properties could have been\nmade for non-payment of installments. The Courts below have held\nthat there is no proof that the property had been even specifically\nallotted in favour of the plaintiffs. Admittedly, the transfer itself has\nnot been completed by a certificate of transfer. A mere allotment does\nnot grant a right to the property itself. It merely is the first stage of\nobtaining a right. If it does not fructify into a transfer deed in the\nmanner provided, then no vested right can ever obtain. Rule 11\nprescribes a mode of transfer, which is reproduced as under:-\n 11. Certificate of transfer:-\n(1) As soon as the last installment of price has been paid by\nthe Cooperative Societies or the individual member of the\nScheduled Caste, as the case may be, in whose favour the\ntransfer has been made under the Rules, the Collector shall\ngrant to it or him under his signatures and seal a certificate of\ntransfer of ownership in the revised Form 'B' appended to\nthese Rules. \n.\nThe Hon'ble Supreme Court recently held in the judgment in\nGreater Mohali Area Development Authority and others Vs. Manju\nJain AIR 2010 SC 3817 that a merely letter of allotment itself cannot\nbe a basis for claiming title to the property. Rule 9-A, which we have\nextracted above again contains a provision for challenging an order of\nR.S.A. No.1559 of 1983\n-5-\ncancellation. The plaintiffs, who had taken notice of the cancellation\ncould not have merely treated the proceedings as void without resorting\nto the procedure prescribed under the Act. The plaintiffs' action for\ninjunction cannot lie and more so, when the plaintiffs have not been\nable to show their possession continuously in pursuance of their\nallotment.\n.\nThe questions of law raised are answered against the\nappellants/plaintiffs and the appeal is dismissed. \n(K. KANNAN)\n JUDGE\nNovember 04, 2011\nPankaj*"
