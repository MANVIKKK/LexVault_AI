  "judgment_text": "FAO No. 1738 of 1995\n-1\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB & HARYANA, CHANDIGARH\nFAO No. 1738 of 1995\nDate of decision July 16, 2010 \nNational Insurance Co. Ltd.\n....... Petitioner \nVersus\nSmt. Saroj and others\n........ Respondent\nCORAM: \nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN\n*****\nPresent:-\nMr. Mahataj Bakhsh Singh, Advocate\nfor the appellant.\nK. Kannan, J (oral)\n 1.\nThe Insurance Company is in appeal against the\njudgment of the MACT contending that in spite of the fact that the driver\nwho drove the vehicle was proved to have had a fake driving licence, the\nliability is wrongly cast on it. \n.\nThe liability of the Insurance Co in a case of a fake\nlicence or a renewal of a licence which was a fake one have been\nconsidered by the Hon ble Supreme Court in several cases and the\ndecisions in National Insurance Co v Swaran Singh (2004) 3 SCC 297\nand United Indian Insurance v Divinder Singh (2007) 8 SCC 342 are\ninstructive. In the latter judgment, it has been held that a renewal of a fake\ndriving licence is no licence at all and hence the insurer shall not be liable. \n.\nIt was even held earlier by the Hon ble Supreme\nCourt, while referring to the effect of a renewal of forged licence, in New\nIndia Assurance Co., Shimla v. Kamla,(2001) 4 SCC 342: \n.\n The observation of the Division Bench of the\nPunjab and Haryana High Court in National Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Sucha\nFAO No. 1738 of 1995\n-2\nSingh that renewal of a document which purports to be a driving licence,\nwill robe even a forged document with validity on account of Section 15 of\nthe Act, propounds a very dangerous proposition. If that proposition is\nallowed to stand as a legal principle, it may, no doubt, thrill counterfeiters\nthe world over as they would be encouraged to manufacture fake\ndocuments in a legion. What was originally a forgery would remain null and\nvoid forever and it would not acquire legal validity at any time by whatever\nprocess of sanctification subsequently done on it. Forgery is antithesis to\nlegality and law cannot afford to validate a forgery.\n.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court in Swaran Singh\n(supra) has an immediate relevance for us in this case for the effect of\nproof of fake licence in the context of the need for discharging the burden\nof proof on the Insurance company that the insured had committed a\nbreach of terms of the policy. The fact that the driver had a fake licence will\nabsolve the insurer of the liability of the insurer only, if it is established that\nthe accident was on account of reasons where the possession of valid\ndriving licence will have relevance for consideration of the aspect of\nnegligence that has to be proved. If the accident was on account of say,\nmechanical defect in the vehicle, the issue of the validity of licence will\nhave no relevance.\n.\nIn this case, the driver has not examined himself\nand there is no evidence about the licence except the copy of the driving\nlicence, which is produced and whose genuineness has been the subject of\nevidence through an officer of the licensing authority with reference to the\nofficial document. The owner has remained ex parte and no evidence is\navailable about his bonafides of enquiry regarding the possession of driving\nlicence by the driver before its entrustment to him. Consequently, the\ninsured shall not have the benefit of indemnity under the policy.\n.\nEven if the insurance company is not liable, the\nFAO No. 1738 of 1995\n-3\nduty to satisfy the award for the claimants cannot be doubted. In \nsuch a situation, the liability to satisfy the award will be accompanied with \na right of recovery from the owner/insured. This cannot be doubted in \nanyway, as specifically provided by the decision of the Supreme Court \nwhile dealing with the effect of proviso to section 149(4) and section\n(5) of the M.V.Act in New India Assurance co v Kamla\n\n (2001\n\n) 4 \nSCC 342:\n. Sub-section (4) of Section 149 of the Act says that so much of the\npolicy as purports to restrict the insurance of the person insured by\nreference to any condition shall  as respects such liabilities as are\nrequired to be covered by a policy ..., be of no effect . The proviso to\nthe said sub-section is important for the purpose of considering the\nquestion involved in this case and hence that proviso is extracted\nbelow:\n Provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge\nof any liability of any person which is covered by the policy by virtue\nonly of this sub-section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that\nperson. \n. Similarly, in this context sub-section (5) is equally important and\nhence that is also extracted below:\n 149. (5) If the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this\nsection to pay in respect of a liability incurred by a person insured by a\npolicy exceeds the amount for which the insurer would apart from the\nprovisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that\nliability, the insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that\nperson. \n. A reading of the proviso to sub-section (4) as well as the language\nemployed in sub-section (5) would indicate that they are intended to\nsafeguard the interest of an insurer who otherwise has no liability to pay\nany amount to the insured but for the provisions contained in Chapter XI\nof the Act. This means, the insurer has to pay to the third parties only\non account of the fact that a policy of insurance has been issued in\nrespect of the vehicle, but the insurer is entitled to recover any such\nsum from the insured if the insurer were not otherwise liable to pay such\nsum to the insured by virtue of the conditions of the contract of\ninsurance indicated by the policy.\n. To repeat, the effect of the above provisions is this: when a valid\ninsurance policy has been issued in respect of a vehicle as evidenced\nby a certificate of insurance the burden is on the insurer to pay to the\nthird parties, whether or not there has been any breach or violation of\nthe policy conditions. But the amount so paid by the insurer to third\nparties can be allowed to be recovered from the insured if as per the\npolicy conditions the insurer had no liability to pay such sum to the\ninsured.\n. The position can be summed up thus:\nThe insurer and the insured are bound by the conditions enumerated in\nthe policy and the insurer is not liable to the insured if there is violation\nof any policy condition. But the insurer who is made statutorily liable to\npay compensation to third parties on account of the certificate of\ninsurance issued shall be entitled to recover from the insured the\nFAO No. 1738 of 1995\n-4\namount paid to the third parties, if there was any breach of policy\nconditions on account of the vehicle being driven without a valid driving\nlicence. Learned counsel for the insured contended that it is enough if\nhe establishes that he made all due enquiries and believed bona fide\nthat the driver employed by him had a valid driving licence, in which\ncase there was no breach of the policy condition.\nThese observations were subsequently cited with approval in Swaran\nSingh s case (supra) also.\n. It is, therefore, evident from the discussions made hereinbefore\nthat the liability of the insurance company to satisfy the decree at the\nfirst \ninstance and to recover the awarded amount from the owner or\ndriver thereof has been holding the field for a long time.\n. Apart from the reasons stated hereinbefore, the doctrine of stare\ndecisis persuades us not to deviate from the said principle.\n \n. The summary of our findings to the various issues as raised in\nthese petitions is as follows:\n(i) Chapter XI of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 providing compulsory\ninsurance of vehicles against third-party risks is a social welfare\nlegislation to extend relief by compensation to victims of accidents\ncaused by use of motor vehicles. The provisions of compulsory\ninsurance coverage of all vehicles are with this paramount object and\nthe provisions of the Act have to be so interpreted as to effectuate the\nsaid object.\n(ii) An insurer is entitled to raise a defence in a claim petition filed under\nSection 163-A or Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, inter alia,\nin terms of Section 149(2)(a)(ii) of the said Act.\n(iii) The breach of policy condition e.g. disqualification of the driver or\ninvalid driving licence of the driver, as contained in sub-section (2)(a)(ii)\nof Section 149, has to be proved to have been committed by the\ninsured for avoiding liability by the insurer. Mere absence, fake or\ninvalid driving licence or disqualification of the driver for driving at the\nrelevant time, are not in themselves defences available to the insurer\nagainst either the insured or the third parties. To avoid its liability\ntowards the insured, the insurer has to prove that the insured was guilty\nof negligence and failed to exercise reasonable care in the matter of\nfulfilling the condition of the policy regarding use of vehicles by a duly\nlicensed driver or one who was not disqualified to drive at the relevant\ntime.\n(iv) Insurance companies, however, with a view to avoid their liability\nmust not only establish the available defence(s) raised in the said\nproceedings but must also establish  breach  on the part of the owner of\nthe vehicle; the burden of proof wherefor would be on them.\n(v) The court cannot lay down any criteria as to how the said burden\nwould be discharged, inasmuch as the same would depend upon the\nfacts and circumstances of each case.\n(vi) Even where the insurer is able to prove breach on the part of the\ninsured concerning the policy condition regarding holding of a valid\nlicence by the driver or his qualification to drive during the relevant\nperiod, the insurer would not be allowed to avoid its liability towards the\ninsured unless the said breach or breaches on the condition of driving\nlicence is/are so fundamental as are found to have contributed to the\ncause of the accident. The Tribunals in interpreting the policy conditions\nwould apply  the rule of main purpose  and the concept of  fundamental\nbreach  to allow defences available to the insurer under Section 149(2)\nof the Act.\n(vii) The question, as to whether the owner has taken reasonable care\nFAO No. 1738 of 1995\n-5\nto find out as to whether the driving licence produced by the driver (a\nfake one or otherwise), does not fulfil the requirements of law or not\nwill have to be determined in each case.\n ..\n(xi) The provisions contained in sub-section (4) with the proviso\nthereunder and sub-section (5) which are intended to cover specified\ncontingencies mentioned therein to enable the insurer to recover the\namount paid under the contract of insurance on behalf of the insured\ncan be taken recourse to by the Tribunal and be extended to claims and\ndefences of the insurer against the insured by relegating them to the\nremedy before regular court in cases where on given facts and\ncircumstances adjudication of their claims inter se might delay the\nadjudication of the claims of the victims.\n.\nUnder the circumstances, the Insurance Company\nshall not be liable to indemnify the insured. The liability is to satisfy the\nclaim under the award with a right of recovery against the insured. The\naward of the Tribunal is modified and the appeal allowed to the above\nextent.\n(K.
