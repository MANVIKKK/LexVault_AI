The claimants in claim petition\nNo. MACT 38 dated 31.10.1992 claimed a sum of Rs. 8,05,000/- as\ncompensation on account of the death of Sandhura Singh whereas Gurdial\nSingh claimant in another case claimed Rs. 12,87,162/- on account of\ninjuries sustained in the accident. \nThe claim petition was contested by respondent Nos. 1 to 3\nbefore the Tribunal wherein a stand was taken that the accident occurred\ndue to the rash and negligent driving by Gurdial Singh scooter driver. It was\nfurther claimed that Sandhura Singh was not earning anything and that he\nwas a liability on the family. The quantum of compensation was also\nchallenged. It was also claimed that the bus was insured with respondent\nNo.4 i.e. Insurance Company. It was further pleaded that accident had\noccurred due to breaking of leaf ( road spring) which was unforeseen\ncircumstance. The insurance company disputed its liability to pay the\ncompensation primarily on the ground that the insurance policy was\ncancelled. \nOn the pleadings of the parties, following issues were framed in\nclaim petition No. MACT 38 dated 31.10.1992 by the learned Tribunal :-\nC.R.No. 1663 of 1997\n[3]\n.\nWhether Sandhura Singh died because of the rash and\nnegligent driving of bus No. PB-11-A 9254 belonging to\nP.R.T.C.

Moga ? OPR 1 & 2.\n.\nRelief.\nThe learned Tribunal on issue No.1 came to the conclusion that\nthe accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving of Bus No. PB-\n-A-9254 belonging to P.R.T.C. Barnala Depot which was driven by\nKewal Singh respondent. This finding has been recorded on the basis of\nevidence led before the Tribunal especially in view of the fact that the stand\ntaken by the driver of the bus was that the leaf of the front wheel ( road\nspring) had broken earlier and was repaired temporarily, which was the\ncause of accident. Accordingly, the learned Tribunal came to the conclusion\nthat in such a situation, the bus should have been kept off the road till it was\nproperly repaired.\nOn issue No.2 the learned Tribunal has held that the claimants\nare the legal heirs of the deceased. \nOn issue No.3, the learned Tribunal came to the conclusion that\nthe bus was insured with the Insurance Company respondent No.4. It is\npertinent to mention here that against this very award the Insurance\nCompany had filed FAO No.1725 of 1997, which was disposed of on\n.12.1997. The insurance Company was absolved of its liability to pay the\ncompensation keeping in view the fact that civil suit filed by the appellant\nherein against the cancellation of insurance policy was dismissed. \nOn issue No. 4, the learned Tribunal was pleased to grant a sum\nof Rs. 3,26,000/- ( Rs. three lakh and twenty six thousand only) as\ncompensation to claimants in MACT case No.38 dated 31.10.1992 whereas\nC.R.No. 1663 of 1997\n[5]\nin MACT case No. 39 dated 31.10.1992 Gurdial Singh injured was granted\na sum of Rs. 1,25,000/- as compensation. The claimants were also held\nentitled to interest @ 12% per annum.\nIn the grounds of appeal the appellant had challenged the award\nprimarily on the ground that the accident had occurred due to the rash and\nnegligent driving of scooter driver and also on the ground that no\nindependent witnesses were examined. There is no force in this contention\nas the learned Tribunal on appreciation of evidence has come to the\nconclusion that the accident had occurred due to the rash and negligent\ndriving by Kewal Singh while driving bus No.PB-11-A-9254. Sh. Gurdial\nSingh admittedly was an eye witness to the accident.\nIt was also claimed that the compensation granted was highly\nexcessive. There is no force in this contention also as Rs. 3,26,000/- ( Rs.\nthree lakh and twenty six thousand only) for an agriculturist, who was 32\nyears of age at the time of accident, cannot be said to be excessive.\nAccordingly, there is no merit in the present appeals, hence, the\nsame are dismissed.\nFebruary 7,2007 \n\n( VINOD K. SHARMA )\n'sp'\nJUDGE"
