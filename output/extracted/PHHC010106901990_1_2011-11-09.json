  "judgment_text": "In the High Court for the States of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh\n  \n C.W.P. No. 3550 of 1990\n Date of decision: 9.11.2011 \nRisal Singh and others\n\n ..Petitioners\n\nVersus\nThe State of Haryana and others\n ..Respondents\nCoram: Hon ble the Acting Chief Justice\n Hon'ble Mr. Justice Rajiv Narain Raina\nPresent:\nMr. Arun Jain, Sr. Advocate\nwith Mr. Amit Jain, Advocate \nfor the petitioners.\nMr. Kamal Sehgal, Addl. A.G.Haryana\nfor the respondents.\n..\n. To be referred to the reporters or not? \n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the \n digest?\nRajiv Narain Raina,J.\n.\nThe present petition filed under Articles 226/227 along with five\nconnected petitions*, are directed against the land acquisition notification No.\nLAC(G)-88/97 dated 26.12.1988 under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition\nAct,1894 and the declaration vide notification No. LAC (G)/NTLA-89/150 dated\n.12.1989 under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (for short, the\n ACT ). Before we deal with the notifications under challenge in these petitions, it\nwould be apposite to narrate in brief a few material facts prior to the notification\nunder challenge which have bearing on the present case as culled from CWP\nNo.3550 of 1990- Risal Singh and others v. The State of Haryana and others.\n.\nOn 4.11.1981, State Government had issued a notification under\nSection 4 for acquisition of land in dispute covering a total area of 812.12 acres\nwhich included the land of the petitioners and the petitioners in the connected\npetitions. The public purpose for that acquisition was to develop the land for\nresidential area carving out Sectors 1, 2 and 3 at Rohtak. Subsequently, the\ndeclaration under Section 6 was issued on 24.2.1984. Since both the notifications\nwere prior to the 1984 amendment of the Act, it was legal and valid then to issue\na declaration under Section 6 up to 3 years from the date of Section 4 notification.\nIt appears that the land owners then represented to the Chief Minister, Haryana\nagainst the acquisition. It is stated in para 7 of the petition that the Chief Minister\nhad acceded to the request of the land owners and directed that the land on\nwhich residential buildings/houses of the petitioners had been constructed should\nnot be acquired. This decision of the Chief Minister was conveyed to the Director,\nTown and Country Planning, Haryana who further conveyed the order to Director,\nUrban Estates, Haryana and the matter was dropped and Section 6 notification\nwas allowed to lapse with effect from 23.9.1986 (P-3 dated 19.9.1986) with the\ncondition that fresh notification under Section 4 may be issued after holding an\ninquiry in consultation with the District Town Planner following a meeting held on\n.7.1996. It was decided vide Annexure P-4 dated 24.9.1986 that if it is found\nthat land lying vacant has been sold in the shape of plots and it does not fit in the\nplanning of HUDA, in that case, it will be of no use to notify the same for\nacquisition. It was also a stipulation that a clear report be submitted as to how\nmany houses had already been constructed in the area and to identify the owners\nof the lands which were then lying vacant.\n.\nSince no fresh notification was issued after lapse of the first\nacquisition the petitioners aver that they remained sanguine that their land would\nremain in their use and ownership and with that implied assurance many land\nowners raised further constructions on their land involving huge expenditure. This\nis where the first chapter of the story ends. \n.\nAll of a sudden, State Government issued a fresh notification under\nSection 4 dated 26.12.1988 again setting in motion the process of acquisition of\nthe land upon which large number of constructions in the shape of residential\nbuildings existed. The petitioners filed objections under Section 5-A praying that\ntheir constructions be left out. It is stated that on the date of the second Section 4\nnotification for acquisition of 479.84 acres, there were approximately 300 built up\nhouses in the area in question and that any move to acquire the land would\nresound in a humanitarian problem which would lead to enmass uprooting rural\nfolk including the petitioners who had made the area their homestead prior to the\nnotification under Section 4. The public purpose of the acquisition was to utilize\nthe land for residential and commercial areas falling in Sector 3, Rohtak under\nthe HUDA Act, 1977 by HUDA in the area of village Bohar HB 68 Tehsil and\nDistrict Rohtak. The objections of the land owners including the petitioners did not\nfind favour with the Land Acquisition Officer and the Section 6 notification came\nto be issued on 22.12.1988 declaring an area of 317.47 acres was required for\nacquisition in which the land/buildings of the petitioners fell. Since the notification\nunder Section 4 of the Act was for 479.84 acres, the declaration under Section 6\nwas issued qua 317.47 Acres, therefore about 150 acres was left out of the\nacquisition. This lacuna was sought to be filled by the State Government by\nissuing a corrigendum notification dated 8.3.1990 where 317. 47 acres was\nincreased to 367.47 acres. In this manner about 50 acres was added in which the\nland and houses of the petitioners was situated. In the affidavit filed by Satbir\nSingh, Land Acquisition Collector, Urban Estate, Haryana in compliance of this\nCourt s order dated 11.7.2011, it has been stated that 33 land owners namely,\nDaya Singh and others had represented to the Director, Urban Estates on\n.3.1990 that their residential houses on the land owned by them if acquired\nwould be to their detriment and cause undue hardship. The request of the land\nowners was approved by the Government on 17.4.1990. It has been further\nstated in the affidavit that a total land measuring 26.99 and 6.91 acres has been\nwithdrawn under Section 48 of the Act vide notification dated 22.6.1990 and\n.4.1992 being the land which was notified under Section 6. In the affidavit, the\ndetails of Rectangle, Killa and Khasra numbers has been set out as also the\nname of persons whose land stood released after completion of the process of\nacquisition. It is relevant to notice that award No. 4 dated 29.3.1990 and award\nNo.18 dated 25.3.1991 had come into existence. A map of the area has been\nannexed showing substantial area of 26.99 acres of land released on 17.4.1990\nafter passing of the awards left out after Section 5-A notification and the\nsubstantial area of 6.91 acres which was also released. The petitioner filed Civil\nMisc. No. 8701 of 2011 in the present proceedings pointing out that the area in\nquestion is by now a developed colony where various amenities stood provided\nby the respondent-authorities. It has been further pointed out that area of some\nland owners has been released who did not even choose to file objections under\nsection 5-A. A letter of the Director, Urban Estates Department, Haryana to the\nEstate Officer, HUDA dated 27.8.1983 has been placed on record (P-13) that 4\nmarlas of land comprised in Khasra No. 173//9/2 had been decided to be\nreleased as there was construction of Samadhi, Havan Kund, Piao and Sat Sang\nHall on the land. Another letter dated 17.3.1988 (P14) of the District Town\nPlanner, Rohtak to State Town Planner, Hissar deals with a request of 68\nresidents of the disputed area in Sector 3 who had represented to the Minister,\nTown and Country Planning Department, Haryana consequent upon which the\nmatter was  studied  and a detailed report is contained in this letter. It was\nreported that the constructions of the 68 land owners was not in a compact block\nbut in different khasra numbers, that is, approximately in all the khasra numbers\nand the adjoining area had already been released from acquisition by HUDA. It\nhas been noticed that this area in question is also under writ proceedings since\nlong and no lay out plan of this area had been drawn. Therefore, a\nrecommendation was made to the Government to consider release of land from\nacquisition. A similar request was recommended for release vide letter dated\n.6.2006 (P15) from District Town Planner, Rohtak to the Administrator, HUDA,\nHissar for release of land of one Shri Surat Singh Nandal.\n.\nMr. Arun Jain learned Senior Counsel unfolded before us the facts of\nthe case and argued that this was eminently a fit case for quashing the impugned\nnotifications under sections 4 and 6 of the Act. He brought to our notice the\ncontents of para 14 of the writ petition, which read as under:-\n  That subsequently a large parcel of land which was covered\nunder residential houses could not be utilized for planned\ndevelopment of Sector 3 was left out. This land included the land of\nthe petitioners mentioned above. A notification was prepared in the\noffice and was sent for publication to the Government Press. Under\nthis notification, land measuring 317.47 acres of land was to be\nacquired and to be included in the Section\nof the Act's\nnotification. However, for extraneous and irrational reasons, the\nnotification sent for publication was recalled by the respondents and\n.3 acres of additional land was added with pen on the notification\nto be sent for publication to the press. The area sought to be\nacquired reflected in Section 6 notification, therefore, increased to\n.50 acres but since the numbers were subsequently added, as\nsuch, the notification still reflects area in acres in column No.4 as\n.47 Acres. \n.\nIn the written statement filed by Mr. R.K. Kazal, Land Acquisition\nCollector, Urban Estates, Haryana, Hissar on behalf of the respondent-State,\nthere is a damaging admission, which reads as follows:-\n That para No.14 of the writ petition is wrong and hence\ndenied. It is submitted that the total acquired land under Section 6\nwas 367.50 acres but it was wrongly published the area 317.47 acres\nwhich was rectified vide corrigendum No. LAC(G)-90/NTLA/187 dated\n.3.90. It is further submitted that those khasra numbers measuring\nland 50.3 acres were not typed and were added with pen. \n.\nIn the circumstances, we called for the original record of the\nnotification under Section 6 dated 22.12.1989. On perusal of the original record,\nwe were confronted with numerous hand written entries of khasra numbers which\nare undated and unsigned. On the last page on the left margin of the notification\nit is only the typed part which is signed by the Joint Secretary to Government of\nHaryana, Urban Estates Department Haryana, Chandigarh. Learned senior\ncounsel submitted that the land of his clients was roped in into acquisition by this\nillegal and unlawful process. Government can speak only in writing, formally and\nby notifications. The land acquisition law being ex-proprietary, it deserves strict\nconstruction. We find merit in the submission and the view canvassed by him is\nlegally sound that the notification under section 6 deserves to be quashed.\n.\nMr. Kamal Sehgal, learned Additional Advocate General, Haryana\nwas at a loss to explain the authenticity and genuineness of the hand written\nkhasra/khewat numbers on the left margin of the notification or who was its\nauthor. \n.\nMr. Arun Jain learned Senior Advocate read the substantive\nprovision contained in Section 6 of the Act that when any particular land is\nneeded for a public purpose,  declaration shall be made to that effect under\nthe signature of a Secretary to such Government or of some officer duly\nauthorized to certify its orders.  The hand written parts on the last page of the\nnotification does not stand the test of Section 6 and cannot be taken as a part of\nit, especially when no corresponding noting regarding insertion of Khasra\nnumbers in question have been produced signed by the Secretary or any\nauthorized delegate of the Government. The precious rights of land owners\ncannot be defeated by sleight of hand. Learned senior counsel next argued that\nthe lands of similarly situated land owners were released from time to time and at\nleast up to 2005 and that therefore, discrimination was writ large and there was\ninfraction of Article 14. He relied upon a recent judgment rendered by the Hon ble\nSupreme Court in Hari Ram Versus State of Haryana and others reported in\n(3) SCC 621 where the test of non discrimination has been introduced into\nthe law of land acquisition in respect of State Government s power under Section\nof the Act to release certain lands from acquisition. The land owners who are\nsimilarly situated have right of similar treatment by the State Government in\nrespect of the same acquisition proceedings. The facts in Hari Ram s case\n(supra) are somewhat similar to the facts of the present case. We may quote with\nprofit para No.24 of the judgment which reads as under:-\n As a matter of fact, lands of more than 40 landowners\nout of the same acquisition proceedings have been released by\nthe State Government under Section 48 of the Act. Some of the\nrelease orders have been passed in respect of landowners\nwho had not challenged the acquisition proceedings\nand some of them had challenged the acquisition proceedings\nbefore the High Court and whose cases were not\nrecommended by Joint Inspection Committee for withdrawal\nfrom acquisition and whose writ petitions were dismissed.\nSome of these landowners had only vacant plots of land and\nthere was no construction at all. In most of these cases, the\naward has been passed and, thereafter, the State Government\nhas withdrawn from acquisition. It is not the case of the\nrespondents that withdrawal from acquisition in favour of such\nlandowners has been in violation of any statutory provision or\ncontrary to law. It is also not their case that the release of land\nfrom acquisition in favour of such landowners was wrong\naction on their part or it was done due to some mistake or a\nresult of fraud or corrupt motive. There is nothing to even\nremotely suggest that the persons whose lands have been\nreleased have derived the benefit illegally. As noticed above,\nprior to October 26, 2007, the State Government did not have\nuniform policy concerning withdrawal from acquisition. As\nregards the guidelines provided in the letter dated June 26,\n, this Court has already held that classification on the basis\nof nature of construction cannot be validly made and such\npolicy is not based on intelligible differentia and a rational\nbasis. What appears from the available material is that for\nrelease of the lands under the subject acquisition, no policy has\nbeen adhered to. This leads to an irresistible conclusion that no\nfirm policy with regard to release of land from acquisition\nexisted. It is true that any action or order contrary to law does\nnot confer any right upon any person for similar treatment. It is\nequally true that a landowner whose land has been acquired for\npublic purpose by following the prescribed procedure cannot\nclaim as a matter of right for release of his/her land from\nacquisition but where the State Government exercises its power\nunder Section 48 of the Act for withdrawal from acquisition in\nrespect of a particular land, the landowners who are similarly\nsituated have right of similar treatment by the State\nGovernment. Equality of citizens' rights is one of the\nfundamental pillars on which edifice of rule of law rests. All\nactions of the State have to be fair and for legitimate reasons.\nThe Government has obligation of acting with substantial\nfairness and consistency in considering the representations of\nthe landowners for withdrawal from acquisition whose lands\nhave been acquired under the same acquisition proceedings.\nThe State Government cannot pick and choose some\nlandowners and release their land from acquisition and deny\nthe same benefit to other landowners by creating artificial\ndistinction. Passing different orders in exercise of its power\nunder Section 48 of the Act in respect of persons similarly\nsituated relating to same acquisition proceedings and for same\npublic purpose is definitely violative of Article 14 of the\nConstitution and must be held to be discriminatory. More so, it\nis not even the case of the respondents that release of land\nfrom acquisition.  \nThe above principles have been further elaborated by the Hon ble\nSupreme Court in its landmark judgment in Bondu Ramasawamy and others\nVersus Bangalore Development Authority and others (2010)7 SCC 129. A\nroad map has been laid down for State Government and development authorities\nand the principles to follow in acquiring land under the Act and that the prevailing\nsystem of acquisition of land needs an overhaul. To begin with, there is absence\nof proper or adequate survey and planning before embarking upon acquisition;\nnotifying areas to start with far larger than what is required for acquisition and\nthen making arbitrary deletions and withdrawals from acquisition. The four other\nvital areas delineated in the judgment which have been identified where\ngovernment would have to step in, are not being referred to here as those issues\ndo not arise in the present case.\nMr. Arun Jain has also sought to buttress his argument against the\nacquisition by pointing out that there was no development plan or survey done at\nthe initial stage to rope in substantial constructions of the petitioners made prior\nto notification under Section 4. He relied upon a Division Bench judgment of this\nCourt sounding the clarion call to all the Land Acquisition Collectors and officers\nof the Town and Country Planning Department and other statutory bodies like\nHUDA and HSIIDC to make comprehensive surveys before sending proposal to\nthe Government before issuing notifications under Section 4 of the Act. The\nrelevant part reads as under:-\n The respondent State of Haryana is directed to issue comprehensive\ninstructions to all the Land Acquisition Collectors of the State, Officers of the\nTown and Country Planning Department, various agencies like HUDA, HSIIDC or\nothers to undertake a comprehensive survey before sending the proposal to the\nGovernment for issuance of notifications under Section 4 of the Act. The\nconcerned officers are to ensure that clause 2 of the policy of the State, dated\n.10.2007 for releasing the structures, which have been built up prior to\nissuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act are not included in the\nproposal for acquisition. Such instructions would bring proximity between law, life\nand justice which look to be distant neighbours in the present scenario. It would\navoid unnecessary harassment to the general public who might have constructed\nsmall houses on the land proposed to be acquired. It would also discourage the\nconstruction activity after issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act or the\ntendency of some unscrupulous element to claim that the building was\nconstructed prior to issuance of notification under Section 4 of the Act. These\nsteps in turn would reduce the disputes between the general public and the State\npaving the way for developing peaceful society and avoiding litigation. \n.\nOn the issue of discrimination as well the lands and buildings of the\npetitioners deserve to be protected by the manner in which lands of similarly\nsituated landowners was released after acquisition in 1988, after coming into\nexistence of awards of 1990 and from time to time even after 15 years till 2005.\nWe see no useful public purpose will be served in upholding the notifications at\nthis distance of time particularly when the petitioners have had the protection of\ninterim orders of this court staying dispossession. We would confirm those\norders. \n.\nIn view of the above discussion and drawing strength from the\naforesaid judgments, we hold that the impugned notifications under Sections 4\nand 6 deserve to be quashed. We order accordingly.\n.\n This writ petition and the connected writ petitions are allowed and\nthe impugned notifications under Sections 4 and 6 are quashed qua the\npetitioners. \n\n (M.M.KUMAR)\n (RAJIV NARAIN RAINA)\n ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\n\n JUDGE\n\nNovember 9th,2011\n nk\n*\nSerial No.\nCivil Writ Petition No.\nTitle\nof 1990\nRisal Singh and others v.
