    "the father of the prosecutrix pertaining to some payment. However, no evidence was led by the accused in their defence. I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the records of the case. The prosecutrix, as per school certificate (Exhibit P.E), was born on 25.3.1983 and she had hardly attained the age of thirteen and a half years on the date of commission of the crime, it being 30.9.1996. No doubt, the age mentioned in the School Certificate is not the conclusive proof of age of the prosecutrix, but even after giving the benefit of error of judgment in forming opinion about the age of the prosecutrix, the age of the prosecutrix cannot be said to be more than fifteen -4- Criminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998. years. As noticed above, Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant), had approached the prosecutrix when she was alone in her house. She was escorted to Narwana by both the accused. The presence of the prosecutrix in the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh at Gohana cannot be denied because their presence was noticed in the Court premises and the local police at Gohana had sent a wireless message to Fatehabad police. The prosecutrix in her statement as P.W.9 has given the detailed account of the prosecution case including the manner in which she was enticed away from her house and the manner in which she was made to stay at Gohana in the house of the sister of appellant Rajbir Singh. Manjeet Kaur (P.W.10) is the mother of the prosecutrix and Balbir Singh (P.W.11) is the elder brother of the father of the prosecutrix, who were examined with regard to the age of the prosecutrix. N.C. Wadhwa (P.W.3) had brought the original register of admission and withdrawal of students in the Girls Senior Secondary School, Fatehabad and had produced the certificate (Exhibit P.E) showing the Date of Birth of the prosecutrix as .3.1983. Sub Inspector Partap Singh (P.W.4), who is Investigating Officer of the case, had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix (Exhibit P.G) when she had been recovered from the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh on 3.10.1996. Mr. A.K. Tyagi (P.W.13), who, at the relevant time, was posted as Sub Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Fatehabad, had recorded the statement of the prosecutrix under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure on 5.10.1996. As would be discussed -5- Criminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998. later on, the prosecutrix was not subjected to rape by appellant Rajbir Singh. Under the circumstances, the evidence furnished by the prosecutrix and the Investigating Officer leaves no room for doubt that the prosecutrix had been kidnapped by the accused from the lawful custody of her parents. The appellant Rajbir Singh has, thus, rightly been convicted and sentenced under Section 363 of the Code. The offence under Section 376 of the Code did not stand proved against the appellant in this case. In her statement (Exhibit P.G) recorded by the police immediately after her recovery from the custody of appellant Rajbir Singh on .10.1996, she did not state about the commission of rape on her by the appellant. She made improvement while making her statement before the Magistrate under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure wherein she stated that she had been raped by the appellant in his sister's house at Gohana. She had made statement under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure before the Magistrate on 5.10.1996 i.e after two days of her recovery from the appellant and by that time she must be under the influence of her parents. The possibility of the prosecutrix being tutored by her parents while deposing before the Magistrate, is clearly evident. Dr. (Ms.) Ramesh Chakravarti (P.W.1), who had medico-legally examined the prosecutrix, did not observe any external marks of injuries on any part of the body of the prosecutrix including thighs and perineum. Besides, no semen was detected by the Forensic Science Laboratory on -6- Criminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998. the articles sent to it for examination. For the aforesaid reasons, the prosecution has been able to prove its case against the appellant under Section 363 of the Code beyond all reasonable doubts. I do not see any ground warranting interference in the impugned judgment of conviction and the sentence order rendered by the learned trial Judge. The same are hereby confirmed. Resultantly, this appeal is dismissed. January 27, 2010. ( MOHINDER PAL ) ak JUDGE"

The\nappellant and Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant) were convicted and\nsentenced under Section 363 of the Code vide judgment of\nconviction and the sentence order dated 24.7.1998 passed by the\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Hisar. The appellant was sentenced to\nundergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay fine of\nRs.200/-, in default whereof to undergo further simple imprisonment\nfor three months whereas Ramesh Kumar (non-appellant) was\nawarded the rigorous imprisonment for one and a half years and\nto pay fine of Rs.200/-, in default whereof to undergo simple\nimprisonment for three months for the said offence. In this appeal,\nappellant Rajbir Singh has impugned the said judgment of\nconviction and the sentence order. \nThe facts of the prosecution case are that the\nprosecutrix (name withheld) had been kidnapped from her house\nby Ramesh Kumar (co-accused of the appellant) on 30.9.1996\nwhen she was alone and her parents were not at home. The\nprosecutrix was reluctant to accompany Ramesh Kumar, but he\nshowed her a knife and extended threats to her. The prosecutrix\nthan accompanied Ramesh Kumar, who took her to Bus Stand of\nFatehabad where appellant Rajbir Singh met them. Both the\naccused then threatened the prosecutrix and made her to sit in\na bus bound for Narwana. After reaching Narwana, accused\nRamesh Kumar alighted from the bus. Thereafter, appellant Rajbir\nSingh took the prosecutrix to Gohana to his sister, namely, Smt.\n-3-\nCriminal Appeal No.667-SB of 1998.\nSheela's house.

However, no evidence was led by the\naccused in their defence. \nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties and\nhave gone through the records of the case. \nThe prosecutrix, as per school certificate (Exhibit\nP.E), was born on 25.3.1983 and she had hardly attained\nthe age of thirteen and a half years on the date of commission\nof the crime, it being 30.9.1996.
