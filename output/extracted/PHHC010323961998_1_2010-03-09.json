JUSTICE K.KANNAN\n.\nWhether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the\njudgment?\n.\nTo be referred to the Reporters or not?\n.\nWhether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? \n*****\nK.KANNAN, J. (ORAL)\nCWP No.7958 of 1988\n.\nThe petitioner seeks for allotment of a plot in his capacity as a\nlocally displaced person, he having suffered loss of property by acquisition\nCWP No.7958 of 1988\n-2-\nunder Punjab Town Improvement Act of 1922. The claim of the petitioner is\nthat as a displaced person, he was entitled to be offered an alternative plot\nof a similar size. The property which he had lost in acquisition was 300 sq.\nyds and he had applied for an allotment to the Chairman of the\nImprovement Trust in the year 1987 and he had also made a payment of\nRs.500/- as earnest money on 25.8.1987. The grievance of the petitioner is\nthat although his brother and sister, who had similarly lost property, had\nbeen favoured with allotment of plots, the same had been denied to him.\n.\nThe writ petition, therefore, came to be filed seeking for a\nissuance of writ of mandamus for allotment of a plot which had been\noriginally allotted to him by the Chairman, Improvement Trust, Ludhiana\nwith the boundaries mentioned in the proceedings.\n.\nThe objection on behalf of the Improvement Trust was that the\nnotification for acquisition had been made on 8.7.1973 under Section 36 of\nthe Punjab Town Improvement Act, 1922 and the acquisition was made on\n.5.1975 as per Section 42 and award has been passed on 1.8.1975. It is\na submission on behalf of the respondent that the petitioner had not made\nany application for allotment all the years till the year 1987 but the Chairman\nof the Improvement Trust had no authority to make allotment without\nconfirmation by the Trust. The further objection was that the Chairman had\nno power to allot a commercial plot and the Rules that were applicable,\nwhen he moved an application in the year 1987, was only the Punjab Town\nImprovement (Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots ) Rules 1983. The\nRules, apart from setting out the definition of locally displaced person\nset out how the allotment in respect of the displaced persons having a joint\nkatha, being co-sharers, could be allotted only for one plot taking into\naccount the whole of joint land acquired and further that the allotment could\nbe made under Rule 11, only to persons who had applied for allotment\nwithin a period of three months from the date of the commencement of the\nCWP No.7958 of 1988\n-3-\nRules. Such allotment would again be available only to persons, who\nowned more than half an acre of property, which was lost in the acquisition.\n.\nThe first point for consideration would be the relevant rule that\nwould be applicable. It could be noticed that there were at different times,\nthree types of Rules, one Ludhiana Improvement Trust Land Disposal\nRules, 1964; subsequently, Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots by\nImprovement Trust Rules, 1975 till it was replaced by Punjab Town\nImprovement (Utilization of Land and Allotment of Plots ) Rules, 1983. The\napplicability of the relevant rule has been dealt with in several decisions of\nthis Hon'ble Court and particularly the matter was considered in\nSmt.Sushma Palta and others Vs. State of Punjab and others reported\nin 2006 (4) RCR (Civil) 223, where a Division Bench of this Hon'ble Court\nwas considering the applicability of the Rule, in relation to the definition of a\nlocally displaced person. Adverting to a situation that the acquisition had\ntaken place prior to 1975, the Division Bench held that the definition that\nwould govern, cannot be the 1975 Rules but only the Rules of the year 1951\nwould be applicable. This issue came up again in yet another case which\nwas disposed in second appeal in Kulwinder Singh Vs. Improvement\nTrust, Ludhiana, in SA No.2699 of 1997, where the Court held that an\nadvertisement which has been issued in the year 1974 before the actual\nacqusition would not be sufficient compliance of the Rules of the year 1964,\nsince the publication was to be effected in a particular manner after the\nacquisition is made and therefore, any advertisement issued even prior to\nthe date of acquisition cannot fetter the right of the individual to apply for an\nallotment without reference to the date stipulated in the 1974 advertisement.\nJudgment of this Court was also confirmed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in\nImprovement Trust, Ludhiana Vs. Kulwinder Singh in Civil Appeal\nNo.1487 of 2003. Gurdev Kaur Vs. State of Punjab and another in CWP\nNo.17248 of 1999, again addressed the issue of allotment of a plot under\nCWP No.7958 of 1988\n-4-\nLudhiana Improvement Trust Land Disposal Rules 1964, when the Court by\napplication of the 1964 Rules directed the competent authority to pass an\norder of allotment of a suitable residential plot in a scheme area. The\ndecision in Gurmukh Singh Vs. State of Punjab and others in CWP\nNo.4242 of 1985, which the learned counsel for the respondent was fair to\ncite is the last judgment in the string of decision that considers the relevant\nrules that would be applicable and the manner of fixation of price. Referring\nto an acquisition of property and allotment of land to a locally displaced\nperson prior to 1975, the learned single Judge held that the 1964 Rules\nwould govern the right of the parties and the property could be allotted to\nhim, if he is found eligible for such allotment at a rate at which the trust had\nlastly sold any residential plot in the development scheme. The entitlement\nunder the 1964 Rules are set out through Section 2(b).\n.\nIn this case, the allotment by the Chairman of the Board is\nattacked on the ground that the property was not even specifically described\nwith reference to the khalta number or specific extent. It merely had set out\nthe property by boundaries and the Chairman himself had issued several\nallotment letters by the same boundaries to other persons also and\ntherefore, the offer which had been made was vague and hence not\ncapable of enforcement .\n.\nThe entitlement for allotment of a plot, in my view, cannot be\ndenied and the petitioner shall be allotted a plot. Even the contention that\nthe plot that was offered by the Chairman of the Board was vague, is\ncontested by the counsel for the petitioner by saying that the property is\nspecifically described with boundaries and there is no difficulty about\nidentifying the same. Learned counsel for the respondent, however,\ncontends that within the boundaries mentioned, there is larger extent of\nproperty more than 2000 sq. yds, which the petitioner is not entitled to. He\ncontends that the Improvement Trust has passed a Resolution on 6.2.2001\nCWP No.7958 of 1988\n-5-\nproposing to raise a monument in the memory of martyrs of Kargil at the\nproperty, which the petitioner claims having been allotted to him. The\nconstruction of the memorial was stayed by an order of this Court in this writ\npetition, when the place was sought to be demarcated by erection of steel\ngrill fencing.\n.\nThe exact location of the property and the extent of property,\noriginally allotted to the petitioner as wholly falling within the boundaries, is\na subject of dispute between the parties, which this court in its exercise of\njurisdictional power under Article 226 of Constitution cannot unravel without\nany further evidence. If the property, which is available there within the\nboundaries is only limited to the extent of 300 sq. yds, even a subsequent\nResolution setting it apart for constructing a monument, shall not be put out\nagainst the petitioner. It shall be duty of the respondent to look for some\nother property for such use. If, on the other hand, the extent of property is\nlarger, and the petitioner shall not be entitled to allotment of such a large\nplot, then the respondent would be entitled to put it to use for which a\nResolution has been passed and they shall be at liberty to allot to the\npetitioner any other alternative plot, which is available under the Scheme.\n.\nThe writ petition is allowed in the above terms. The compliance\nof order shall be made within a period of three months.\nCR No.2515 of 1989 (O&M)\nThere is no representation for the petitioner. The order of\nimpleadment already made by the court below, is confirmed in the light of\nentitlement as formed in the order in the writ petition. The Civil Revision is\ntherefore dismissed.\nMarch 09, 2010\n (K.KANNAN)\nVt\nJUDGE"
