JUSTICE K. KANNAN\n.\nWhether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the\njudgment ? \n. \nTo be referred to the Reporters or not ?\n.\nWhether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?\n-.-\nK. KANNAN J.(ORAL)\n.\nThe challenge to the award of the Labour Court at the instance\nof the management namely Punjab State Tubewell Corporation Ltd. is\nmade on two counts: One, the purported reference that had been made\nwas without notice and therefore, the reference to the Labour Court was\nvitiated. Two, the workman had been terminated from service on\naccount of his being rendered surplus and being a junior most in the\ncadre that he belonged, he was required to be retrenched and notice of\nretrenchment was duly issued under Section 25-F of the Industrial\nDisputes Act and compensation was also paid to him which he had\nreceived. There had been a perfect statutory compliance and therefore,\nthe award of the Labour Court finding the termination to be illegal was\nunjustified. The management, therefore, seeks for quashing of order.\nC.W.P No.13635 of 1993\n-2-\n.\nLearned counsel appearing for the workman submits that he\nhad been appointed on work-charged basis for projects undertaken at\nvarious divisions as a Mate on 01.02.1978 and later was promoted and\nposted as Work Mistry on 01.10.1979. He had continued his services in\nsuch a post till the management passed order dated 04.05.1988. He had\nbeen ordered to be reverted from his designated post as Work Mistry to\nlower rank Chowkidar (Mate). Within five days, on 10.05.1988, a\nnotice of retrenchment had been served and on 06.06.1988, the\nretrenchment compensation had been given and received by the\nworkman.\n.\nThe challenge to retrenchment came immediately thereafter\nwhen a demand notice had been issued on 29.06.1998 and the\nproceedings were before the Labour Court on a reference from the\nGovernment. \n.\nOn the objection that the reference itself was bad, the Labour\nCourt had considered the fact that there was nothing on record to show\nconclusively that the management had not been heard before a reference\nwas finally made to the Court. It reasoned that in the absence of best\nevidence in the form of record of the Labour Commissioner, Punjab, it\nshould be taken that the management withheld from the Court vital\nevidences for the reasons best known to it and held the issue against the\nmanagement. I am not persuaded to take any different view on the\nlegality of the reference itself.\n.\nWhile considering the issue whether the retrenchment was\nvalid or not, the Labour Court had considered the fact that even the\norder of reversion purported to have been made on 04.05.1988, had been\nmade without any prior notice and even before the ink dried in the office\nC.W.P No.13635 of 1993\n-3-\norder, notice of termination was issued. The Labour Court had referred\nto the fact that the workman had stated on oath that notice of\nretrenchment was given on the same day when he was also informed that\nhe had been reverted. In matter of public employment, it is\ninconceivable that even if there was a decision for reversion, it could be\nmade without following the elementary principles of natural justice of\nserving notice on the workman to show cause against reversion. The\nreversion was just not a change in designation but it had serious\nconsequences of lower scale of pay. Again reversion cannot be a matter\nof mere administrative exigency with no formulation about how it could\nbe done without any reference to seniority. All that, we find from the\norder of reversion on 04.05.1988 was that he was senior in the lower\ncategory from which he was promoted. Actually, the juniormost\namongst the higher post alone could have been reverted and the\nreference must have been made with reference to his rank being the\njunior most from the post from which he was being reverted. Again the\norder of reversion refers to two other persons Balu Ram and Gurdev\nSingh also as having been reverted on the same day.\n.\nThe Labour Court has found that even amongst the persons,\nwho had been retained in the service after the so-called reversion, there\nwere persons who were lower in the order of seniority such as Piara Lal\ns/o Gurditta Ram (Sr. No.50) and several other persons who had been\nshown lower in the ranks as Chowkidars and they had been still in\nservice. Learned counsel appearing for the Corporation would find fault\nwith the reasoning adopted by the Labour Court by pointing out that the\npersons who had been retained in service had been inducted as\nChowkidars and the workman was a Mate who belonged to a different\nC.W.P No.13635 of 1993\n-4-\ncategory. Even in the order of reversion, the reference to the designation\nof the workman is stated to be only Chowkidar and the expression Mate\nis stated in parenthesis. Even in the seniority list, which had been\nproduced before the Labour Court, it is said to be only an extract of the\nseniority of Chowkidars and the extension which was sought to be\ngiven, was wrongly done. If only there was an official gradation that\nexisted that a Mate could not be accommodated as a Chowkidar, there\nwas no reason why a person who is senior amongst the workmen that\nwere in the same Class IV category should be jettisoned and persons\nwho were juniors to him should be retained in service. There was not\neven any evidence that there was any rational classification amongst the\nvarious categories of workmen amongst Class IV category. With no\nevidence coming from the management to explain with reference to the\nService Rules making differentiation in the classes of workers amongst\nthe same category, the Labour Court was justified in finding the\nreversion and the retrenchment to be illegal.\n.\nThe Labour Court has considered what was relevant and has\npassed the order directing reinstatement of the workman as Chowkidar\nwith continuity of service and back wages. I affirm the decision and\ndismiss the writ petition. No costs.\n(K. KANNAN)\n JUDGE\nJuly 15, 2009\nPankaj*"
