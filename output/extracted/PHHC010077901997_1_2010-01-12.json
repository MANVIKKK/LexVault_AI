  "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA\nAT CHANDIGARH\nCriminal Appeal No. 557-SB of 1997\nDate of decision: 12th January, 2010\nHanuman\n   Appellant\nVersus \nState of Haryana \n  Respondent\nCORAM: \nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA\nPresent: \nMr. Atul Lakhanpal, Senior Advocate with\nMr. Surinder Batra, Advocate for the appellant.\nMr. Deepak Jindal, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana \nfor the State. \nMr. Sudhir Sharma, Advocate for the complainant. \nKANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. \nIn the present case accused had fired shot from a country-\nmade pistol, which had hit knee of Balwan. The accused made a\ndisclosure statement and got recovered the country-made pistol. Amar\nSingh appeared as PW-2 and supported the version given by ASI\nDharamvir PW-3. In pursuance of the disclosure statement made, pistol\nEx.P1 and empties Ex.P2 to P4 were recovered on 8th March, 1995. The\ntrial Court had convicted the appellant for offence under Section 25 of the\nArms Act and had sentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for\ntwo years. It was further ordered that the sentence shall run concurrent\nwith the sentence awarded to the accused under Section 307 IPC. \nThis Court had separately decided Criminal Appeal No.554-\nSB of 1997, wherein it was held that accused had fired shot at Balwan\nand had caused an injury which fall under Section 308 IPC and has\nCriminal Appeal No.557-SB of 1997\nsentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years. The\ntestimony of Amar Singh PW-2 and ASI Dharamvir PW-3 has been relied\nin the case under Section 308 IPC, where Amar Singh had appeared as\nPW-12 and ASI Dharamvir had appeared as PW-15. Therefore, once\nrecovery of weapon in pursuance of disclosure statement has been\nproved and it has been held by the Court that fire arm was used to cause\ninjury, there is no justification to substitute the well reasoned judgment of\nthe trial Court. However, as the trial Court had stated that the sentence\nawarded under Section 25 of the Arms Act shall run concurrent with the\nsentence awarded under Section 307 IPC, this Court acting as an\nappellate Court also affirms this finding and orders that sentence of two\nyears rigorous imprisonment awarded to the appellant under Section 25\nof the Arms Act shall run concurrent with the sentence of three years\nrigorous imprisonment awarded to him under Section 308 IPC. \nWith the observations made above, present appeal is\ndisposed of. \n[KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA]\nJUDGE\nth January, 2010\nrps"
