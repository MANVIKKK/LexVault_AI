After\nsummoning, accused had appeared on 23.11.1994. Notice\nunder Section 85(g) of the Act was issued on 5.1.1995. Under\nthe Act, no limitation is provided. Maximum sentence under\nSection 85(g) of the Act is two years and to pay a fine of\nRs.500/-. Contribution is every month.

Learned counsel for the revisionist cited ESIC Vs.\nC.C.Santhakumar, JT 2006(10) SC 549.\nLearned counsel for the respondent argued that as\nper Section 468 Cr.P.C. complaint was not within limitation.\nCourt has no power to take cognizance beyond the expiry of\nlimitation. Due to non-production of record, complaint should\nhave been filed within six months. As per the Act, question\nof limitation can be agitated at any stage even after\ncognizance is taken. In the present case, cognizance was\ntaken on 5.1.1995 when notice was issued.\nAs per allegation of the revisionist, respondent\nfailed to produce record pertaining to the payment of\ncontributions, inspection book, payment vouchers, ledgers\nand cash book etc for investigation for the period from\n.7.1988 to 12.10.1992 and 13.10.1992 onwards as required\nunder Section 45 of the Act. Complaint was presented in the\nCourt of learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Gurdaspur on\n.11.1993.\nCrl. Revision No.388 of 1996.\nNotice was issued to the accused to appear in the\nCourt. After appearance of the accused, on 23.11.1994, notice\nunder Section 85(g) was issued on 5.1.1995. Record is silent\nas to on which date application for dropping proceedings\nunder Sections 468 and 204 Cr.P.C. were presented. \nDue to non-production of record, accused are liable\nfor the commission of offence punishable under Section 85(g)\nof the Act. \nSection 85(g) of the Act is reproduced as under:-\n (g) is guilty of any contravention of or non-\ncompliance with any of the requirements of this Act or the\nrules or the regulations in respect of which no special penalty\nis provided.\n( he shall be punishable \n(i)\nwhere the commits an offence under clause (a),\nwith imprisonment for a term which may extend\nto three years but-\n(a)\nwhich shall not be less than one year, in case\nof failure to pay the employee s contribution\nwhich has been deducted by him from the\nemployee s wages and shall also be liable to\nfine of ten thousand rupees;\n(b)\nwhich shall not be less than six months, in\nany other case and shall also be liable to fine\nof five thousand rupees.\nProvided that the Court may, or any\nadequate and special reason to be\nCrl. Revision No.388 of 1996.\nrecorded in the judgment, impose a\nsentence of imprisonment for a lesser\nterm.\n(ii)\nwhere he commits an offence under any of the\nclauses (b) to (g) (both inclusive), with\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to\none year or with fine which may extend to four\nthousand rupees, or with both.)\nIn E.S.I.C. v. C.C. Santhakumar, JT 2006 (10) SC\n, the Hon'ble Supreme Court observed as\nunder:-\n 21. It is clear, therefore, that the right\nof the Corporation to recover these amounts by\ncoercive process is not restricted by any limitation\nnor could be the Government by recourse to the\nrule-making power prescribed a period in the teeth\nof Section 68.\n. In the above judgment this Court has\nclearly held that Section 68 of the Act empowers\nthe Corporation to resort to coercive process, to\nrecover the contribution from the employer as if it\nwere an arrear of land revenue and the said right is\nnot restricted by any limitation. This is a crucial\nSection.\n. Similarly, no limitation is provided in\nChapter VII. It deals with the imposition of penalty\nor levy of damages upon failure to pay\nCrl. Revision No.388 of 1996.\ncontributions. It consists of Sections 84 to 86A.\n. When the Act itself does not provide\nfor any limitation on the Corporation right to claim,\nthe employers cannot rely upon Regulations 32 to\n, dealing with the period for maintenance of\nregisters, to imply any limitation.\n Gurdeep Singh Vs. State and others,\n(3) 289 was relied by the learned trial Court\nfor disposing of the application for dropping\nproceedings wherein it was held that:\n A.\n Delhi Police Act, 1978, Sections 93 and\nand 2 ( r)- Altercation took place inside the\nhouse   No offence under Section 93 made out-\nOffence under Section 93 is made out if accused\nused any street or public place for threatening,\nabusive or insulting words or behaviour with\nintend to provoke breach of peace.\nB.
