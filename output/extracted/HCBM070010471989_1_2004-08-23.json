Vashi for the petitioner.\nMr. D.B. Sawant for the respondent Nos.1 and 2.\nCORAM: ANOOP V. MOHTA, J.\nDATED: 23RD AUGUST, 2004.\nORAL JUDGMENT :\n.\nThe present Petition is under Article 226 and 227 of the Constitution\nof India, filed by the petitioner (Assistant teacher) and thereby, has challenged the\norder and judgment dated 27th October, 1989, passed by the Presiding Officer,\nSchool Tribunal, Mumbai [for short  Tribunal ], in Appeal No. GEN/71/SND/3 of\n, whereby, the Tribunal, had allowed the Appeal but only granted the benefit\nunder Section 11(2)(e) of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools\n(Conditions of Service) Regulation Act, 1977 (for short  MEPS Act ) and\ndirected to pay six months' salary by way of compensation instead of\nreinstatement, although the termination order dated 30th March, 1988, of the\npetitioner was set aside. The Petitioner, being aggrieved, therefore, has basically\nprayed for reinstatement as permanent Assistant Teacher and all other benefits. \n.\nHeard the learned counsel appearing for the parties. The basic issue\nwhich needs to be answered in this Petition is the right of the petitioner, being an\nopen category candidate, to have a status of permanency as Assistant Teacher on a\nreserved post.\n.\nThe provisions of the MEPS Act and the Rules made thereunder\ngovern the recruitment and conditions of service of employees in private Schools.\nThe relevant Sections are Sections 4, 5 and 9. The relevant Rules are called the\nMaharashtra Employees of Private School Rules [for short `MEPS Rules']. The\nrelevant Rules, which covers the case in hand, are Rule 9 and 28. \n.\nThe petitioner was appointed temporarily in the post of Assistant\nTeacher for the period 1984-1985 and 1985-1986. Thereafter, he was appointed\non probation for a period of two years under Section 9(5) of the MEPS Act. The\nsaid appointment order itself contained a clause that his appointment would be\nsubject to the approval of the Education Department of District Sindhudurg. The\nrespondent-Management, however, by an order dated 30th March, 1988, terminated\nthe services of the petitioner. The petitioner, therefore, preferred an Appeal under\nSection 9 of the MPES Act and Rules. The School Tribunal, after considering the\ncontentions raised, including the written submissions filed by respondents, passed\nthe impugned order and held that the impugned termination notice dated 30th\nMarch, 1988, was illegal, invalid and improper. Accordingly, the Appeal was\nallowed. However, not granted reinstatement with back wages, after recording the\nstatement that 'a suitable substitute from S.T. category is posted'. The respondents\nwere directed to give him six months salary only. \n.\nIt appears from the record, as well as, the Written Statement filed by\nthe Management that the post in question was reserved for SC/ST candidate. As\nper the advertisement, the petitioner was appointed for the respective years, subject\nto the approval from the Education Department, Zilla Parishad, Sindhudurg. The\nsaid appointment was purely temporary. As there was no candidate available,\nbelonging to the said reserved category, petitioner was appointed temporarily, on\nthe said post. The said process was continued for two years more. The\nrespondent's case is that as the candidate belonging to the reserved category were\nnot available or did not respond to the advertisement and, therefore, were left with\nno choice, but to appoint the petitioner on a temporary basis. The foundation of\nthe respondents cannot be overlooked as the post was meant for reserved\ncategories and this post was always subject to the approval from the Education\nDepartment. There is no dispute that the petitioner belongs to the open category.\nThe petitioner's entitlement to enjoy the post, in the circumstances, would be\nsubject to the non-availability of reserved category candidate or such other\ncandidate. The fact that he was appointed from time to time from the year 1984\nupto 1987-1988, by that itself, nowhere gives any right to such candidate to claim\npermanency, even after expiry of the alleged probation period, in the facts and\ncircumstances of the case.\n.\nIn this background and in view of the submission as raised and as\nreferred in the Written Statement, as well as, recorded by the Tribunal in paragraph\n, I am also of the view that now, at this stage, i.e. after more than 15 years, it is\ndifficult to accept the prayer of reinstatement. The finding given by the Tribunal is\nalso justified to maintain the order to the effect that 'unless the said post becomes\nde-reserved', a candidate appointed temporarily on such vacancy of ST/SC\ncategory would have only status of 'temporary' candidate.\n.\nA candidate from the open category cannot claim a right of\npermanency, on the said reserved post. There is nothing pointed out that such post\nbecomes de-reserved automatically after lapse of time or any other such things. In\nthe circumstances, appellant being open category candidate would have no right to\nhold the post meant for reserved category candidate. The `quota' or any action\nbased on the Reservation Policy cannot be disturbed without following the due\nprocedure of law. \n.\nIt needs to be mentioned here that if candidates belonging to the\nSC/ST category are not available, the petitioner's case may be considered by the\nManagement, if there is still a vacancy and/or the post is still required to be filled\nin. However, the Management is at liberty to consider this aspect, if a case is\nmade out on merit.\n.\nIn view of this observation, I decline to interfere with the finding\nrecorded by the Presiding Officer, School Tribunal, dated 27th October, 1989,\nhence termination is upheld.\n.\nThe Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of. No order as to costs.\nCertified copy expedited.\n [ANOOP V. MOHTA, J.]"
