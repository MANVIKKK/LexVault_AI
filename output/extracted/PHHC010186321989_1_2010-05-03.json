No.759 of 1989\nDate of Decision.03.05.2010\nAvtar Singh and others\n........Petitioners\nVersus\nState of Punjab through the Secretary Government of Education,\nPunjab, Chandigarh and others\n....Respondents\nPresent: None for the petitioners.\nMr. Manohar Lall, Addl. A.G., Punjab.\nCORAM:HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN\n.\nWhether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the\njudgment ? No\n. \nTo be referred to the Reporters or not ? No\n.\nWhether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? No\n-.-\nK. KANNAN J.(ORAL)\n.\nThe claim in the writ petition is for counting of ad hoc\nservice for the purpose of ACP scales. The ACP scales were directed\nto apply for Teachers under the 4th Punjab Pay Commission. The\ninstructions that have been issued have made pointed reference to\ntwo decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court namely State of Punjab\nand others Vs. Harjinder Kaur and others in Civil Appeal No.6525\nof 1998 dated 18.05.2001 and the judgment in State of Haryana Vs.\nHaryana Veterinary & AHTS Association and another AIR 2001 SC\n, which held that for the purpose of ACP Scales, it shall be only\nthe regularized service that will be counted and ad hoc service will\nstand excluded. The point raised in the writ petition is squarely\nanswered by the two decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court\nC.W.P. No.759 of 1989\n-2-\nreferred to above and the petitioner, therefore, cannot obtain a\nfavourable consideration in the light of the said decisions.\n.\nThe writ petition is, therefore, dismissed.\n(K. KANNAN)\n JUDGE\nMay 03, 2010\nPankaj*"
