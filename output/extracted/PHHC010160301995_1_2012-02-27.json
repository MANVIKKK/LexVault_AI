No.15026 of 1994\nThe petitioners pray for issuance of a writ for quashing\nproceedings, under Section 7 of the Punjab Village Common Lands\n(Regulation) Act, 1961 (as applicable to the State of Haryana)\n(hereinafter referred to as the '1961 Act'), pending before the\nAssistant Collector Ist Grade, Dadri.\nThe petitioners claim that they are proprietors of Pana\nCivil Writ Petition No.15026 of 1994(O&M)\n-2-\nMahaigan, which created a Dholi in favour of Sham Dass Sadh son\nof Mani Ram Bairagi Sadh Deredar. The land, therefore, does not\nvest in the Gram Panchayat and the petition filed under Section 7 of\nthe 1961 Act could not be filed, against the Dholidar, without\nimpleading the petitioners. \nCounsel for the Gram Panchayat submits that as the\nquestion of title has already been decided upto the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt, the present petition may be dismissed and the Assistant\nCollector Ist Grade, may be directed to proceed with the petition, filed\nunder Section 7 of the 1961 Act.\nWe have heard counsel for the parties.\nAdmittedly, a petition, filed under Section 7 of the 1961 Act\nis pending. We, therefore, find no reason to keep the writ petition\npending and without expressing any opinion as to the merits of the\ncontroversy, dispose of the writ petition with liberty to the petitioners\nto raise all such pleas as may be available, in accordance with law,\nbefore the Assistant Collector Ist Grade. \nParties are directed to appear before the Assistant\nCollector Ist Grade, Dadri, on 17.04.2012, who shall decide the\nmatter afresh and in accordance with law, within three months from\nreceipt of a certified copy of this order.\n(RAJIVE BHALLA)\n JUDGE\nFebruary 27, 2012\n (RAKESH KUMAR JAIN)\nnt\n JUDGE"
