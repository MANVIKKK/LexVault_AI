JUSTICE L. N. MITTAL.\nPresent:\nMr.Sandeep Jain, Advocate for the appellant.\nMr. Vikas Jain, Advocate for respondent Nos.1 to 3.\nRespondent No.4 ex parte.\nService of respondent No.5 dispensed with.\nL. N. MITTAL, J (ORAL)\nPlaintiff-Gurdev Singh having failed in both the Courts\nbelow, has filed the instant second appeal.\nPlaintiff-appellant alleged that he is in possession of the\nsuit property, which is shamlat property, for more than twenty years.\nThe defendants without any right, title or interest threatened to\ndispossess the plaintiff therefrom. The plaintiff sought permanent\ninjunction restraining the defendants from forcibly dispossessing the\nplaintiff from the suit property and from interfering in his possession\nthereon. \nDefendant Nos.1 to 4 contested the suit and denied the\nplaint averments. The defendants pleaded that plot Nos.12, 13, 29\nand 9 min were allotted to Attar Singh migrant from Pakistan being\nevacuee property in lieu of his claim of property left in Pakistan. Attar\nRSA No.221 of 2006 (O & M) \n-2-\nSingh was succeeded by his two sons Milkha Singh and Kartar\nSingh, who orally partitioned the said plots. Plot Nos. 29 and 9 min\nfell to the share of Milkha Singh and have been inherited by his sons\ndefendant Nos.1 to 3, which became owners in possession thereof,\nwho is the suit property. Plot Nos.12 and 13 fell to the share of\nKartar Singh. Defendant Nos.1 to 3 delivered possession of the suit\nproperty to defendant No.4 vide agreement dated 13.03.1997, who is\nin possession thereof. Various other pleas were also raised.\nDefendant Nos.2 to 4 were later on proceeded ex parte. Defendant\nNo.5 did not appear in spite of service and was proceeded ex parte\nin the trial Court. \nLearned Civil Judge (Junior Division), Nawashahr vide\njudgment and decree dated 17.09.2002 dismissed the plaintiff's suit.\nFirst appeal preferred by the plaintiff has been dismissed by learned\nAdditional District Judge, Nawanshahr vide judgment and decree\ndated 09.08.2005. Feeling aggrieved, plaintiff has filed the instant\nsecond appeal.\nI have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused\nthe case file.\nLearned counsel for the appellant vehemently contended\nthat the plaintiff-appellant is in possession of the suit property and,\ntherefore, cannot be dispossessed therefrom except in due course of\nlaw. Reliance in support of this contention has been placed on a\njudgment of this Court in the case of Hukam Singh versus Tara Singh\nand others, 1992 Civil Court Cases 771 (P & H). The contention\ncannot be accepted because the plaintiff-appellant has miserably\nfailed to prove his possession over the suit property. Oral statements\nRSA No.221 of 2006 (O & M) \n-3-\nof plaintiff and another witness examined by him are not sufficient to\nprove that the plaintiff-appellant is in possession of the suit property.\nThird witness examined by the plaintiff is only a Draftsman, who\nprepared the site plan. On the other hand, statements of plaintiff's\nwitnesses also stand rebutted by statements of the defendants'\nwitnesses. Thus plaintiff's evidence is not sufficient to prove that he\nis in possession of the suit land. Moreover, mere tethering of cattle\nor storing of manure as pleaded by the plaintiff would not depict that\nhe is in possession of the suit plot. \nLearned counsel for the appellant next contended that the\nlower appellate Court erroneously observed that plaintiff-appellant is\nnot owner of the suit property and in fact even the plaintiff appellant\nhas pleaded himself to be in possession thereof being Shamlat\nproperty. This contention also does not help the appellant because\npossession of vacant land is presumed to be of the owner. The\nevidence of plaintiff-appellant is not sufficient to prove that even\nwithout being owner of the suit land, he is in possession thereof. At\nthe risk of repetition, it has to be mentioned that mere acts of\ntethering of cattle etc. do not clothe the plaintiff appellant with\npossession of the suit land. The plaintiff has even failed to prove the\nsaid acts that he is tethering cattle and storing manure etc. in the suit\nland. \nLearned counsel for the appellant next contended that\ndefendants have failed to prove that the suit land was allotted to\npredecessor of defendant Nos.1 to 3 and has been sold by defendant\nNos.1 to 3 to defendant Nos.4 and 5. It was also pointed out that\nlearned lower appellate Court erroneously observed that defendant\nRSA No.221 of 2006 (O & M) \n-4-\nNos.4 and 5 are admittedly true owners of the suit land and the\nplaintiff appellant cannot seek injunction against them and earlier\ndefendant Nos.1 to 3 were true owners. It was contended that\nfinding of the trial Court on this aspect to the contrary has been\nreversed by lower appellate Court without recording any reasons.\nRelying on judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in M/s Nopany\nInvestment (P) Ltd. versus Santokh singh (HUF), 2008(2) Civil\nCourt Cases 300 (S.C.), learned counsel for the appellant contended\nthat first appellate Court ought to give reasons for reversing the\nfinding of the trial Court. The entire contention is misconceived and\ndevoid of merit. Irrespective of whether defendants or any of them\nare owners of the suit property or not, the plaintiff cannot succeed\nunless he proves his own possession over the suit property.\nHowever, the plaintiff has failed to prove his possession over the suit\nproperty and, therefore, he has been rightly non-suited by the Courts\nbelow. There is concurrent finding by both the Courts below holding\nthat plaintiff is not proved to be in possession of the suit property.\nThe said finding is based on proper appreciation of evidence and is\nsupported by cogent reasons. The said finding does not warrant\ninterference in second appeal. No question of law, much less\nsubstantial question of law, arises for determination in the instant\nsecond appeal. The appeal is found to be without any merit and is\naccordingly dismissed.\n.11.2010.\n ( L. N. MITTAL )\nA. Kaundal\nJUDGE"
