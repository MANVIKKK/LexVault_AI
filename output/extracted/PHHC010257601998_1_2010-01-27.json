JUSTICE RAJAN GUPTA\nPresent:\nMr. B.S. Wasu, Advocate \nfor the petitioner. \nMr. O.P. Dabala, Deputy Advocate General, Punjab. \nRAJAN GUPTA J. (ORAL)\nThis is a petition under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of\nIndia praying for writ in the nature of certiorari for quashing the order dated\n.07.1987, Anneuxre P-2 passed by Sub Divisional Officer (Civil) Sangrur\nwhile exercising the power of Appellate Authority under the Punjab\nMunicipal Act, 1911. \nThe assessment in question relates to residential property\nsituated within the municipal limits of Sangrur. The property is stated to be\nowned by respondent No. 2. At the time of assessment of house tax, a\nnotice was issued to him by Executive Officer, Muncipal Committee,\nSangrur. After hearing the objections, the annual rental value was\ndetermined at Rs. 3000/- for the rented portion and Rs. 3,000/- for self\nCivil Writ Petition No. 2028 of 1998\noccupied portion vide assessment order dated 28.01.1987 (Annexure P-1).\nRespondent No. 2 appealed against the said order before the Sub-Divisional\nOfficer (Civil), Sangrur. But after hearing the parties, Sub-Divisional\nOfficer (Civil) observed that no portion of house was let-out. He, thus,\nset-aside the assessment order in so far it pertained to portion purportedly\nlet out and reduced the assessment in respect of self occupied portion from\nRs. 3,000/- to Rs. 28,00/-. Learned counsel for the petitioner has argued\nthat the order passed by the appellate authority is unsustainable. According\nto him, the authority could not have exempted the rented portion from\nassessment of house tax. He has also assailed the finding of appellate court\nto the effect that house was not rented out. Learned counsel, therefore,\nprays that matter may be remanded back to the same authority for decision\nafresh. \nNo reply has been filed on behalf of the respondents. The\nprayer for remand is, however, not opposed by learned State counsel. \nI have heard counsel for the parties and given careful thought to\nthe facts of the case. \nFrom the order passed by appellate authority, it is not clear\nwhether the assessment order was passed in respect of entire residential\nproperty in question or part thereof, nor is it specified how a finding of fact\nwas arrived at by the appellate authority that the house was not rented out. \nUnder the circumstances, this court accepts the prayer made by\ncounsel for the parties that the matter be remanded back to the same\nauthority for decision afresh. Resultantly, impugned order dated 24.07.1987,\nAnnexure P-2 passed by appellate authority is hereby set-aside. The matter\nis remitted back to the same authority for taking a fresh decision after\nCivil Writ Petition No. 2028 of 1998\nhearing the parties. The parties are directed to remain present before the\nappellate authority on 05.03.2010.\nWith the above said observations, the writ petition is allowed. \nJanuary 27, 2010\n(RAJAN GUPTA)\nAjay\n JUDGE"
