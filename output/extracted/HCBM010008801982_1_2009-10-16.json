DALVI,JJ.\n October 16, 2009.\nP.C.\n.\nShri Farooq Mirza Hussein Ravi appellant no.2 and \naccused no.3 had submitted an application dated 8/10/2007 \nthrough the Superintendent, Yerwada Central Prison at Pune \npraying for the benefit of Section 427(1) of Cr.P.C. Said prayer \nwas reiterated by his subsequent applications dated 29/2/2008 \nand 27/3/2008.\n.\nCriminal Appeal Nos.739 and 748 of 1982 came to be \ndecided by a common judgment dated 1st August, 1984 by a \nDivision Bench of this Court and the sentence awarded to \naccused no.3 - Farooq Mirza Hussein Miya Ravi (accused no.1 in \nSessions Case No.508 of 1980) was directed to run concurrently \nwith the sentence awarded to him in Sessions Case No.509 of \n. It is apparent that in Sessions Case No.508 of 1980 the \napplicant was arraigned as accused no.1 and in Sessions Case \nNo.509 of 1980 he was arraigned as accused no.3. From the \norder of conviction and sentence passed in Sessions Case No.\nof 1980, these appeals came to be filed and while the \nappeals were allowed in respect of accused nos.1 and 4 partly, \nthe order of conviction and sentence against applicant-accused \nwas confirmed. From the report received by Mr.Pol from the \nYerwada Central Prison at Pune it is clear that no appeal was \nfiled from the order of conviction and sentence passed in \nSessions Case No.508 of 1980. In the said case he was \nsentenced for the offence punishable under Section 392 of IPC \non 31/8/1983 and sentenced to suffer RI for seven years. In \nSessions Case No.509 of 1980 he was convicted for the very \nsame offence and sentenced for the same period of seven \nyears as per the order dated 18/9/1982 and, therefore, the \nsentence awarded to him in Sessions Case No.508 of 1980 was \nto run concurrently with the sentence awarded and confirmed \nby this Court in Sessions Case No.509 of 1980 and in the \njudgment and order dated 1/8/1984 referred to hereinabove \nthis Court had extended the said benefit to the applicant. \nDespite this it appears that Criminal Writ Petition No. 3605 of \ncame to be filed before this Court which was decided on \n/8/1984 and it was directed that the sentence awarded in \nSessions Case No.508 of 1980 and Sessions Case No.1980 was \nto be concurrent and not consecutive. The applicant had \nsurrendered to the jail to undergo sentence on 8/10/1983. On \n/4/1984 he was released on parole of 30 days and he \nabsconded for almost twenty years i.e. till he was arrested on \n/4/2004. For the same he was punished and after his re-arrest \non 4/4/2004 he was also given the benefit of set off within the \nmeaning of Section 428 of Cr.P.C. and on suffering the sentence \nhe has been released on 12/8/2008 by taking into consideration \nthe orders passed on 1/8/1984 as well as on 7/8/1984 by this \nCourt for the benefit under Section 427(1) of Cr.P.C.\n.\nHence this application does not survive any further and \nthe same is dismissed as infructuous.\n (SMT.ROSHAN S. DALVI,J.) \n (B.H.MARLAPALLE,J.)"
