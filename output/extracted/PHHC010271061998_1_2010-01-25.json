State of Haryana and others\nCORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE PERMOD KOHLI\nPresent:\nMr.RK Malik, Senior Advocate, with \nMs.Renu Chaudhary, Advocate.\nMr.RKS Brar, Addl. AG, Haryana.\nPERMOD KOHLI, J. (Oral):\nHeard the learned counsel for the parties at length.\nThe facts are taken from CWP No.3223 of 1988.\nThese petitions have been filed challenging the order\npassed by the Director, Higher Education, Haryana, Chandigarh,\nCWP No.3223 of 1988 2\nwithdrawing the interim benefit earlier granted to the petitioners and\nconsequential recovery. It appears that the petitioners working in\nvarious schools were granted benefit of interim relief with effect from\n.12..1985 on the pattern of the University Grants Commission\nGrades. The first instalment was released and thereafter on\nconsideration of the matter, the impugned order dated 12.5.1987,\nAnnexure P-3 (in CWP No.3223 of 1988) has been passed withdrawing\nthe benefit/relief and the excess amount is sought to be recovered.\nIn the reply filed by the respondents it is stated that on the\nbasis of the letters dated 2.8.1983 and 29..4.1985 issued from the\nGovernment of India, on the recommendation of 4th Pay Commission,\nthe Government of Haryana sanctioned two instalments of interim\nrelief. After disbursement of the first instalment and at the time of the\ndisbursement of the second instalment, it came to the notice of the\nauthorities that the payment has been made in violation of the\ninstructions Annexure P-2. On that basis, impugned order came to be\npassed.\nMr.RK Malik, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\npetitioners submits that he has instructions to say that the petitioners do\nnot dispute the refixation of their pay or withdrawal of the benefit, but\nconfine relief only to the recovery part. \nFrom the reply, it appears \n neither fraud nor\nmisrepresentation is attributed to the petitioners. It was only on the\nbasis of the interpretation of the government instructions that the\nCWP No.3223 of 1988 3\namount was paid to the petitioners. The issue involved in the present\nwrit petitions is squarely covered by a Full Bench judgment of this\nCourt in the case of Budh Ram and others Vs. State of Haryana and\nothers (CWP No.2799 of 2009) decided on 22.5.2009 wherein the\nfollowing observations have been made:-\n We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that\nin case the employees who are recipient of the\nbenefits extended to them on an erroneous\ninterpretation or application of any rule, regulation,\ncircular and instructions have not been any way\ncontributed to such erroneous interpretation or\nhave they committed any fraud, misrepresentation,\ndeception to obtain the grant of such benefit, the\nbenefit so extended may be stopped for the future,\nbut the amount already paid to the employees\ncannot be recovered from them. \nIn view of the above, the present writ petitions are partly\nallowed while upholding the refixation/withdrawal of the relief, the\nrecovery against the petitioners is hereby quashed. If any recovery pursuant\nto the impugned orders is made from the petitioners, the same shall be\nrefunded to them within a period of four months. No costs.\nA copy of this order be placed on the record of each connected\nfile.\n.01.2010\n(PERMOD KOHLI)\nBLS\nJUDGE\nCWP No.3223 of 1988 4"
