JUSTICE MOHINDER PAL.\nPresent:\nMr. Baldev Singh, Senior Advocate, with \nMr. Arshvinder Singh, Advocate, \nfor the appellants.\nMr. Vishal Munjal, Additional Advocate General, Punjab.\n-.-\nMOHINDER PAL, J.\nImpugned in this appeal is the judgment of\nconviction and the sentence order passed by the learned\nSessions Judge, Ludhiana, convicting and sentencing the\nappellants under Section 498-A and 304-B of the Indian Penal\nCode (for short `the Code'). For the former offences, the appellants\nwere sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years\nand to pay fine of Rs.500/-, each, in default whereof to undergo\nfurther rigorous imprisonment for one month and for the latter\n-2-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\noffence the appellants were sentenced to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment for seven years. The substantive sentences of\nimprisonment awarded to the appellants were ordered to run\nconcurrently. \nThe instant case was registered at the instance of\nKahan Singh, brother of Harbans Kaur (deceased). As per facts of\nthe case, Harbans Kaur (deceased) was married to appellant\nTapinderpal Singh on 18.2.1994. Sufficient dowry was given at the\ntime of marriage by the parents of Harbans Kaur according to\ntheir status. Seven or eight days after the marriage, appellant\nTapinderpal Singh, husband of Harbans Kaur, Avtar Singh, her\nfather-in-law and Kartar Kaur, her mother-in-law started\ntelling her that her parents had not given sufficient dowry. On\nthis account, she was mal-treated and was asked to bring\nRs.25,000/- from her parents. Harbans Kaur stated the fact of\ndemand of dowry and ill-treatment by the accused on her visit to\nher parents prior to `Lohri' festival. Kahan Singh, brother of\nHarbans Kaur, Gurcharan Singh, a cousin brother of Harbans Kaur and\nthe mother of Harbans Kaur went to the house of the accused one\nday prior to the `Lohri' and at that time Harbans Kaur stated that\nshe was being subjected to ill-treatment on account of demand of\ndowry. Kahan Singh, Gurcharan Singh and the mother of\nHarbans Kaur told the accused that they were not in a position to\npay the amount and that the same would be paid to the accused\nafter harvesting the crop. \nOn 3.2.1995, complainant Kahan Singh along with\n-3-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nGurcharan Singh again went to meet Harbans Kaur in her\nmatrimonial house. On reaching there, they came to know from the\nneighbours that Harbans Kaur had been taken to hospital at\nSudhar. Then they went to the hospital and learnt that Harbans Kaur\nhad died. Suspecting foul play, complainant Kahan Singh went to\nthe police and got registered the instant case against the\nappellants. \n After completion of investigation and due formalities,\nchallan against the accused was presented before the Ilaqa\nMagistrate, who committed the case to the Court of Session. \nCharge under Sections 498-A and 304-B of the Code\nwas framed against the accused, who did not plead guilty to the\ncharge and claimed trial.\nAt the trial, the prosecution examined Draftsman\nSukhwinder Singh (P.W.1), Dr. S.K. Gupta (P.W.2), complainant\nKahan Singh (P.W.3), Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4), Sub Inspector\nSikattar Singh (P.W.5), Assistant Sub Inspector Makhan Singh\n(P.W.6) and Constable Balbir Singh (P.W.7). \nIn his statement recorded under Section 313 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh,\nbesides denying the prosecution allegations and pleading false\nimplication, stated as under:-\n \nThe deceased was handsome and\nbeautiful lady whereas I am simpleton, hard\nof speaking and physically disabled. She was\n-4-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nnot happy to marry with me and she used\nto remain in a sorrow mood and complained\nme that her parents have married her to a\ndung, which I tolerated. My father on coming\nto know about her condition, took her to\nRaikot hospital from where she was referred\nto Ludhiana hospital and in the way at\nSudhar her condition deteriorated and she had\nto admit at Sudhar. I had cordial relations\nwith my wife and at no stage demanded any\ndowry and it was sufficient that I was married\nwith such a beautiful girl. \nIn their statements recorded under Section 313 of the\nCode of Criminal Procedure, appellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur\ndittoed the statement of accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh.\nThe accused, in defence, examined Dr.Swaran Singh\nSandhu (D.W.1), Surjit Kaur (D.W.2) and Avtar Kaur (D.W.3). \nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have\ngone through the records of the case. \nAt the outset, it may be mentioned here that keeping\nin view the evidence of the prosecution, its case against\nappellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur is not free from doubt.\nIn his statement made before the police by complainant Kahan\nSingh, brother of Harbans Kaur (deceased) leading to the\nregistration of the instant case against the accused, no specific\n-5-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nallegations have been made against appellants Avtar Singh and\nKartar Kaur, who are parents of appellant Tapinderpal Singh.\nGeneral allegations have been levelled against them i.e\nappellants Avtar Singh and Kartar Kaur, conveying that they\nwere hand in glove with appellant Tapinderpal Singh in\ntorturing Smt.Harbans Kaur on account of insufficiency of dowry.\nIt is a tendency on the part of the family of the victim to\nrope in as many members of the family of the in-laws of the\nvictim in a case like this as possible. Appellant Kartar Kaur was\nfound innocent during investigation by the police and had not\nbeen challaned. She was summoned to face trial by the trial\nCourt on an application moved by the prosecution under Section\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure. Appellant Kartar Kaur is a\nteacher by profession and it appears that she had nothing to\ndo with the demand of Rs.25,000/-. Harbans Kaur (deceased)\nwas taken to hospital by appellant Avtar Singh on coming to\nknow about her condition. Avtar Singh appellant had first taken\nHarbans Kaur to the clinic of Dr.Swaran Singh Sandhu (D.W.1)\nat Raikot. Dr. Swaran Singh Sandhu (D.W.1) had referred\nHarbans Kaur to C.M.C, Ludhiana as her condition was serious.\nDr. Swaran Singh Sandhu (D.W.1), who was M.B.B.S, M.S\n(General Surgery) ex-P.C.M.S proved the slip/Certificate (Exhibit\nD.A) whereby Harbans Kaur was referred by him to C.M.C,\nLudhiana. The role of appellant Tapinderpal Singh in the\ncommission of the crime will be discussed in the later part of the\njudgment. However, keeping in view the facts and circumstances\n-6-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nof the case, especially the fact that appellants Avtar Singh and\nKartar Kaur had nothing to do with the demand of dowry, I\nam of the considered opinion that the case of the prosecution\nagainst them has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubts\nand they are entitled to be extended the benefit of doubt. \nThe question arises as to whether accused-appellant\nTapinderpal Singh is liable for the offences under Section 498-A\nand Section 304-B of the Code for which offences he has\nbeen found guilty by the learned trial Judge. Section 304-B of\nthe Code, for facility of reference, is reproduced hereunder:-\n \n-B. Dowry death.- (1) Where\nthe death of a woman is caused by any\nburns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise\nthan under normal circumstances within\nseven years of her marriage and it is shown\nthat soon before her death she was\nsubjected to cruelty or harassment by her\nhusband or any relative of her husband for, or\nin connection with, any demand for dowry,\nsuch death shall be called  dowry death , and\nsuch husband or relative shall be deemed to\nhave caused her death . \n\nAs per the provisions of Section 304-B of the Code,\n-7-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nthe offence of  dowry death  consists of three ingredients i.e\ndeath of a woman is caused by burns or bodily injury or occurs\notherwise than under normal circumstances; that the death\noccurs within seven years of her marriage; and that soon\nbefore her death, she was subjected to cruelty or harassment\nby her husband or his relatives for or in connection with any\ndemand for dowry. If these three ingredients are there, the\noffence of  dowry death  can be said to be complete and\nproved. \n In this case, admittedly Harbans Kaur had died\nwithin two months of marriage, as her marriage with appellant\nTapinderpal Singh had taken place on 18.12.1994 and she died\non 3.2.1995. Death of Harbans Kaur occurred otherwise than\nunder normal circumstances. Dr. S.K. Gupta (P.W.2), who had\nconducted post mortem examination on the dead body of\nHarbans Kaur, after receipt of the report of the Chemical\nExaminer that Aluminium Phosphide was detected in the\nviscera, had declared the cause of death due to poison. The fact\nthat soon before her death Harbans Kaur was subjected to\ncruelty or harassment by appellant Tapinderpal Singh for or in\nconnection with any demand of dowry, is proved on record as is\nevident from the evidence led by the prosecution. Complainant\nKahan Singh (P.W.3) and Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4) have deposed\nthat Harbans Kaur (deceased) had been married with appellant\nTapinder Singh on 18.12.1994. The evidence of Kahan Singh\n(P.W.3) and Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4) is consistent about their\n-8-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nvisits to the village of appellant Tapinderpal Singh. Appellant\nTapinderpal Singh was running a Medical Store and had\ndemanded Rs.25,000/- from the parents of the deceased in order to\nexpand his business. The depositions of Kahan Singh (P.W.3)\nand Gurcharan Singh (P.W.4) establish without any doubt the\ncase of the prosecution against appellant Tapinderpal Singh.\nAppellant Tapinderpal Singh, as observed above, in his statement\nrecorded under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, has\ntaken the plea that the deceased was a beautiful lady whereas\nhe was a simpleton, hard of speaking and physically disabled;\nthat she was not happy to marry appellant Tapinderpal Singh and\nthat she used to remain in a sorrow mood. However, before\nthe marriage of Harbans Kaur with appellant Tapinderpal Singh,\nall these facts must have been brought to the notice of the\nparents of Harbans Kaur by the persons who had acted as\nintermediaries in arranging this marriage, but at no stage\nHarbans Kaur or her parents raised any objection. Ranbir Singh\nSarpanch (D.W.4) has disclosed the names of persons who had\nacted as intermediaries in arranging this marriage and they are\nJagdev Singh, Harbans Singh and Gian Singh of Village Talwandi.\nNone of these persons has been examined by appellant\nTapinderpal Singh. They were the best persons who could throw\nlight upon the circumstances whether it was a forced marriage or\nwhether the facts of appellant Tapinderpal Singh being stammering\nand simpleton were brought to the notice of Harbans Kaur and her\nparents prior to the marriage. Three photographs of appellant\n-9-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nTapinderpal Singh with deceased Harbans Kaur taken on the\noccasion of marriage are on record. One photograph depicts\nthe occasion of ring ceremony where the bride is putting ring\non the ring finger of the bridegroom. These photographs do not\nindicate that it was a forced marriage. The defence taken by\nappellant Tapinderpal Singh in this regard is an afterthought. The\nlife of Harbans Kaur came to an end by consuming some\npoisonous substance within two months of her marriage, which\nshows the magnitude of the harassment meted out to her by\nappellant Tapinderpal Singh. The above discussed evidence clearly\nestablishes that soon before Harbans Kaur ended her life, she\nwas subjected to cruelty by accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh\non account of demand of dowry. So, the third ingredient of the\noffence of  dowry death  i.e whether the deceased was subjected\nto cruelty or harassment soon before her death for or in connection\nwith dowry demands by accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh,\nstands proved from the evidence on record. \nFor the aforesaid reasons, the prosecution has been\nable to prove its case against accused-appellant Tapinderpal Singh\nunder Section 304-B and 498-A of the Code. The impugned\njudgment of conviction recorded by the trial Court in respect of\nappellant Tapinderpal Singh is, therefore, upheld. The sentence\nimposed upon appellant Ram Sarup also commensurates with the\noffence committed by him. The impugned sentence order qua\nappellant Tapinderpal Singh is also, accordingly, upheld. \nThe net result is that this appeal qua appellants\n-10-\nCriminal Appeal No.981-SB of 1998.\nAvtar Singh and Kartar Kaur is accepted, the impugned\njudgment of conviction and the sentence order qua them are set\naside and they are acquitted of the charge framed against them\nby giving them the benefit of doubt. However, this appeal qua\nappellant Tapinderpal Singh is dismissed. \n\nJanuary 21, 2010.\n\n ( MOHINDER PAL )\nak\n JUDGE"
