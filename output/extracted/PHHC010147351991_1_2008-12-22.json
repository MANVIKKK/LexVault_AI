JUSTICE SURYA KANT\n. Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment ?\n. Whether to be referred to the Reporters or not ?\n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?\nPresent:\nShri Roshan Lal Sharma, Advocate for the petitioner.\nShri G.S. Attariwala, Additional Advocate General, Punjab \nfor the respondents.\nORDER\nSurya Kant, J. - (Oral):\nThe petitioner seeks a mandamus for finalization of the\ndisciplinary proceedings pending against him and thereafter to grant him\npromotion, arrears of salary and other service benefits.\nWhile working as Senior Branch Officer with Markfed at\nSangrur, the petitioner was served with a charge-sheet dated 24.4.1984\n(Annexure P-1). Before that, the petitioner was placed under suspension on\n.9.1983 which was revoked vide order dated 28.1.1987. The petitioner\nsubmitted his reply to the charge-sheet. It further appears that besides the\nCWP No.2188 of 1991 -: 2 :-\npetitioner, some more employees were also charge-sheeted by the Markfed.\nAn Inquiry Officer was appointed on 7.9.1984 to conduct a joint inquiry\nagainst all of them. It further appears that while the inquiry proceedings\nwere near completion, one of the charge-sheeted employee (Harpal Singh)\nfiled CWP No.114 of 1987 challenging the disciplinary proceedings\ninitiated against him. No stay was, however, granted by this Court against\nthe inquiry proceedings but passing of the final order was stayed.\nMeanwhile, the inquiry officer had submitted the report but no further\naction on that basis was taken against the petitioner or those employees in\nwhose favour there was no interim order passed by this Court.\nIn sum and substance, the petitioner wanted that the\ndisciplinary proceedings should be finalized as he was expecting his\nexoneration, which would have made him entitled to claim the arrears of\nsalary during the period he remained under suspension, as also\nconsideration for further promotion.\nThis writ petition was filed in the year 1992. More than 16\nyears have passed thereafter. There is every possibility that by now, the\ndisciplinary proceedings have come to an end and whatever consequential\nbenefits might have been found due, have also been released in favour of\nthe petitioner.\nBe that as it may, having regard to the nature of relief sought in\nthis writ petition, the same is disposed of with a direction to the Markfed to\ntake a final decision in the disciplinary proceedings, if the same has not\nbeen taken so far, and if such a decision has already been taken and the\npetitioner has been exonerated, to consider his claim for all the\nconsequential benefits including the promotion, arrears of pay, etc. as early\nCWP No.2188 of 1991 -: 3 :-\nas possible but not later than four months from the date of receipt of a\ncertified copy of this order. \nThese directions shall not be taken as an expression on the\nmerits of the allegations levelled against the petitioner.\nDecember 22, 2008.\n [ Surya Kant ]\nkadyan\n Judge"
