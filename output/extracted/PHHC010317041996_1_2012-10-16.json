No.\n.\nTo be referred to the reporters or not ? No.\n.\nWhether the judgment should be reported in the digest ? No.\n\n ----\nK.Kannan, J. (Oral)\nThe appeal is at the instance of the State challenging the\naward passed by the Additional District Judge, Patiala, against the\ncompensation assessed for acquisition of land for construction of\ndiversion of Railway Crossing for SYL Canal. The notification had\nbeen issued on 17.10.1985 under the Land Acquisition Act. The\nproperty situate was in Rampur Kaleran, HB No.94, Tehsil Sirhind,\nDistrict Patiala. The Land Acquisition Collector had assessed the\ncompensation of ` 72,990/- for chahi and nehri lands and in the\nappeal, the landowners had relied on the award passed by the \nFAO No.1346 of 1996 (O&M)\n- 2 -\nDistrict Judge on 06.09.1990 in Alampur Village. The Government\nhad relied on two transactions of sale Ex.R3 dated 03.03.1983 and\nR-4 dated 02.06.1983, but the Court chose to rely on the valuation\nassessed by the District Judge in proceedings relating to\ncompensation in adjoining village. I have not the benefit of\ninformation of what the sale deeds recited as consideration, for, I\nsecure no help from either of the parties. I find no error in the\napproach made by the Additional District Judge by its reference to\nthe award of the District Judge in contemporaneous proceedings\nrelating to determination of compensation in the immediate adjacent\nvillage. I maintain the award and dismiss the appeal.\n\n(K.KANNAN)\n JUDGE\n.10.2012\nsanjeev"
