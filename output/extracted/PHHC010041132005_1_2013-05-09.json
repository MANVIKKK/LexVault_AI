  "judgment_text": "C.R. No. 104 of 2005\nIN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT \nCHANDIGARH\nC.R. No. 104 of 2005\nDate of decision :09.05.2013\nMange Ram\n....Petitioner\nV/s\nDina Nath Sharma\n....Respondent\nBEFORE : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE RAJAN GUPTA\nPresent: \nMr. R.K. Gupta, Advocate for the petitioner. \nMr. Vinod Bhardwaj, Advocate for the respondent. \nRAJAN GUPTA J. \nPresent revision petition is directed against the order \npassed by the Rent Controller whereby application filed by the \npetitioner for leading additional evidence has been dismissed. \nLearned counsel for the petitioner has assailed the \norder. He has submitted that landlord was residing at a distant \nplace. For this reason, he could not depose before the Rent \nController at the time of affirmative evidence. The court below has, \nthus, erred in rejecting the application for leading additional \nevidence. He has relied upon judgment of this court reported as \nCharan Singh vs. Ajit Singh 1999(Suppl.) Civil Court Cases 458.\nLearned counsel for the respondent has opposed the \nplea. He submits that petitioner has merely delayed the matter. \nPetitioner was granted ample opportunity to lead evidence in \naffirmative. He is merely trying to fill up lacuna in the case. Thus, \ntrial court has rightly rejected his prayer for leading additional \nevidence. \nC.R. No. 104 of 2005\nI have heard learned counsel for the parties. \nAn eviction petition was instituted by respondent-\nlandlord in the year 2001. After issues were framed, 7 effective \nopportunities were granted to him for leading evidence but \npetitioner failed to examine any witness. Petitioner closed his \nevidence on 05.05.2003. He, however, tendered a copy of the rent \nnote which was taken on record by the trial court as mark  A . \nThereafter, evidence of the respondent was recorded. At the time \ncase came up for rebuttal evidence, petitioner made an effort to \nlead affirmative evidence. He examined one witness Ram Phal, an \nofficial from Food & Supply department. Instant application for \nleading additional evidence was moved thereafter. Trial court \nrejected the plea observing that petitioner was granted sufficient \nopportunity to lead his evidence in affirmative but he failed to do \nso. I find no infirmity with the order passed by the court below. \nThe judgment relied upon by counsel for the petitioner in Charan \nSingh case (supra) is not applicable to facts of this case. In any \ncase, petitioner has not been able to show that evidence could not \nproduced earlier despite due diligence. On the other hand, he was \ngranted 7 effective opportunities but he failed to adduce evidence. \nEviction petition has been pending before the Rent Controller for \nmore than a decade. There is no ground to interfere in revisional \njurisdiction of this court. Dismissed. \nMay 09, 2013\n(RAJAN GUPTA)\nAjay\nJUDGE"
