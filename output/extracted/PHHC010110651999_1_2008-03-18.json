  "judgment_text": "Criminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997 \nIn the High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Chandigarh.\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997\nDate of Decision: 18.3.2008.\nRajinder Singh\n\n  Appellant\nVersus\nState of Punjab\n\n  Respondent\nCORAM: HON BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA\nPresent: Mr. R.K.Battas and Mr. R.D.Gupta, Advocates\n\nfor the appellant.\nMr. Mehardeep Singh, Assistant Advocate\nGeneral, Punjab, for the State.\nKanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia, J. (Oral)\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997 has been preferred by\nRajinder Singh who was nominated as accused in case FIR No. 27\ndated 6.6.1994 registered at Police Station Amloh under Sections 307\nread with Section 34 IPC.\nAppellant was tried along with his wife Balbir Kaur and learned\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Fatehgarh Sahib, acquitted his wife and\nheld him guilty under Section 307 IPC and sentenced him to undergo\nfive years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs.2,000/-. In default of\npayment of fine, he was further ordered to undergo four months rigorous\nimprisonment.\n\nLearned trial Court has held that the appellant has caused\ninjuries to Baljit Singh with a gatra kirpan on the right side of chest of\nthe victim and the chest injury was declared dangerous to life. Baljit\nCriminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997 \nSingh injured remained admitted in C.M.C. Ludhiana. On 4.6.1994, he\nwas medicolegally examined by Dr.A.Joseph and the following injuries\nwere found on his person:-\n 1.\ncm long incised wound on his right side\nchest anteriorly in 6th intercostal space\nabout 10 cm from midline communicating\nwith plaural cavity, bleeding was present;\n.\ncm long incised wound left side chest\nanterior-lateral aspect about 13 cm from\nmidline in 5th of intercostal space minimum\nbleeding was present;\n.\n.5 cm long incised wound left side chest\nanteriorly about 10 cm from midline in 7th\nintercostal space minimum bleeding was\npresent;\n.\ncm long incised wound left side of chest\nlaterally about 21 cm from midline\nsubcutaneous tissue was deep, minimal\nbleeding was present; AND\n.\ncm long incised wound left elbow\nposteriorly subcutaneous tissue deep,\nminimal bleeding was present .\nBaljit Singh injured, appeared as PW.3. He has reiterated the\nversion given by him in the FIR. Briefly stated, Baljit Singh PW.3 has\nstated that appellant Rajinder Singh along with his wife Balbir Kaur\ncame in the hutment in the fields. They raised objection as the water\nCriminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997 \nseepage used to go to the fields of accused. It is further stated that\nBalbir Kaur caught hold of him from his leg and Rajinder Singh caught\nhold him from his arms and thereafter Rajinder Singh took out his gatra\nkirpan and gave three blows on the left flank, which caused injuries on\nthe ribs of Baljit Singh, complainant. It was stated that the motive for the\noccurrence was a land dispute regarding partition of land. Baljit Singh\nwas thoroughly cross-examined. The defence failed to cause any dent in\nhis testimony. \nBaljit Singh, PW.3, was corroborated by the testimony of\nMalkiat Singh, PW.4. \n\nIt has been stated before me that no reliance should be placed\nby this Court on the testimony of Baljit Singh, PW.3 and Malkiat Singh,\nPW.4 as they are interested witnesses and no independent witness has\nbeen examined. It has been further contended that there are material\ndiscrepancies, contradictions and improvements in the testimony of the\nwitnesses, therefore, they suffer from blemish. It has been further stated\nthat there is a delay of 30 hours in lodging of FIR and, therefore, the\nprosecution case should be disbelieved.\nHaving heard Mr. R.K.Battas, I am of the considered opinion\nthat these arguments in itself are not sufficient to return acquittal of the\nappellant. As far as the delay is concerned, benefit has already been\ngiven to the wife of appellant. Baljit Singh is an injured witness. His\npresence at the spot is stamped. He will be the last person to substitute\nor falsely implicate any other person as accused. Accused and\nwitnesses belong to the same village. Furthermore, testimony of the\nwitnesses is fully corroborated by the medical evidence and the\nCriminal Appeal No. 792-SB of 1997 \ninvestigating agency has examined the spot. Therefore, on this ground,\nI am afraid, sole accused cannot be acquitted when the injured had\ntaken a definite stand against him in the witness box. \n\nIn the alternate, Mr. Battas has contended that in the present\ncase occurrence pertains to year 1994 and a period of 14 years is going\nto lapse and protracted trial in itself should be construed as mitigating\ncircumstance. It is further contended that the parties are residents of\nsame village and sending the appellant behind the bars at this stage\nmay not disrupt peace, amity and cordial relations prevailing between\nthe parties. At the same time, this Court is conscious of the fact that the\ninjuries given were very serious. Victim remained in C.M.C. Ludhiana\nand the treatment given to him as revealed by the doctor, in his\nstatement, does not entitle the appellant to reduction of sentence to\nalready undergone especially when the appellant has only undergone\ntwo months and ten days.\nTaking totality of circumstances into view, ends of justice will\nbe fully met in case sentence of appellant is reduced from five years to\ntwo and a half years and fine is increased to Rs.20,000/- and the fine be\ndeposited within three months. Fine so deposited, be disbursed to the\ninjured. In case the fine is not deposited then the appellant shall\nundergo six months in default.\n\nWith these observations, the present appeal is disposed off.\n\n (Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia)\n\n Judge\nMarch 18, 2008\n\n DK"
