No.732 OF 1992 (o&m) \n DATE OF DECISION : 23.7.2013 \nHarish Chand \nPETITIONER\nVERSUS\nThe State of Haryana and another \nRESPONDENTS\nCORAM : HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MAHESH GROVER\nPresent:-\nShri Jagdish Manchanda, Advocate for the petitioner.\nMs.Meenakshi Verma, Additional A.G. Haryana.\nShri Atul Lakhanpal, Senior Advocate with Shri Arjun Lakhanpal,\nAdvocate.\nMAHESH GROVER, J. \nThe petitioner impugns the order of his retrenchment. He was\nworking as a Technical Supervisor with respondent No.2. i.e. the Haryana State\nSmall Industries & Export Corporation Ltd. when he along with other similarly\nsituated persons faced retrenchment. The rentrechment was necessitated on\naccount of the closure of the Corporation which fact is controverted by the counsel\nfor the respondents who contends that only one unit was closed. This plea of the\npetitioner has been vehemently controverted by the respondents who has asserted\nthat the entire Corporation had since been closed and its operations wound up.\nC.W.P. No.732 of 1992 -2-\nThere is no such material on record from where it can be inferred that the\nCorporation has been wound up. But the counsel for the petitioner certainly\nadmits that one unit of the Corporation has been closed. There is no order to this\neffect also on record. So even if the statement of the counsel for the petitioner is\naccepted to be correct, then also there is nothing on record to show that a\nrehabilitation policy was formulated by the respondents to adjust the retrenched\nemployees. It was incumbent for the petitioner to place on record such a policy in\nthe event of seeking such a benefit therefrom.\nIn the absence of any such material, this Court has been precluded\nfrom evaluating as to whether the petitioner was entitled to rehabilitation more\nparticularly when it has been shown by the respondents that the Corporation or a\npart thereof employing the petitioner is no longer in existence. Apart from that,\neven if the best case of the petitioner is accepted, he would have been entitled to\nadjustment as per the policy, if any and this would have made him entitled to a\nbenefit which today can be termed to be illusory, as he would not have got any\nmonetary benefits from the respondents on account of such an adjustment on the\nprinciple of 'no pay for no work'.\nFor all intents and purposes, the instant petition has been rendered\ninfructuous as the petitioner who preferred the petition, has expired and the writ\npetition is being prosecuted by his legal representatives.\nFor the aforesaid reasons, the writ petition is dismissed as having\nbecome infructuous.\n(MAHESH GROVER)\nJuly 23, 2013\n\nJUDGE\nGD\n\nWHETHER TO BE REFERRED TO REPORTER? YES/NO"
