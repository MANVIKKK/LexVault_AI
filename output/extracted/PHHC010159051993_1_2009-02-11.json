(Oral)\nIn the present writ petition, challenge is to the award dated\n.3.1992 (Annexure P-9) vide which the Labour Court has come to the\nconclusion that the services of the workmen have not been terminated and\nthey were very much the employees of the respondent-Management and,\nthus, the dispute as sought to be raised by the workmen did not exist as the\nenquiry proceedings were going on against them. Thus, the reference being\npre-mature, it was answered against the workmen and in favour of the\nManagement.\nCounsel for the petitioners contends that the Labour Court has\ngone beyond the reference. He contends that the reference was whether\ntermination of services of the 23 workmen who had preferred a demand\nnotice on which references were sent for adjudication to the Labour Court,\nC.W.P.No.5829 of 1993\n-2-\nwas justified and in order and if not, to what relief/exact amount of\ncompensation each of them is entitled to. He contends that the Labour\nCourt instead of adjudicating upon the reference made to it has proceeded to\nhold that there was no termination of the workmen and in view of this, the\nreference was pre-mature. He submits that the workmen had not been\nallowed to work in the factory and they were not allowed to enter the\npremises due to which they could not perform their duties. This would\nlead to only one conclusion that their services had been terminated by the\nManagement. He submits that this termination was abrupt without holding\nany proper enquiry as neither any notice was given nor any charge-sheet\nwas issued nor any retrenchment compensation paid to them. Therefore, he\ncontends that the termination is not in accordance with law and the\nprovisions governing the services of the workmen i.e. the Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 have been violated with impunity. He relies upon the\nstatements of the workmen to contend that they have categorically stated\nbefore the Labour Court that they have not been allowed to continue in\nservice as they were not allowed to perform their duties. In this view of the\nmatter, he submits that the award passed by the Labour Court cannot be\nsustained as the requirement of the reference was to adjudicate upon the\nissues as to whether the termination of the services of the workmen was in\norder and to what relief and amount of compensation they were entitled to.\nThat having not been done, the present writ petition deserves to be allowed.\nHe further relies upon an award dated 21.12.1992 (Annexure P-10) passed\nby the Labour Court, Jalandhar, of a co-worker wherein a reference\npreferred by a similarly situated employee had been answered in favour of\nthe workmen although the same grounds which have been taken by the\nC.W.P.No.5829 of 1993\n-3-\nemployer as in the case of the petitioners were rejected by the Labour Court.\nHe further contends that a writ petition preferred by the respondent-\nManagement against this award i.e. C.W.P.No.7289 of 1993 was dismissed\nby a Division Bench of this Court on 12.1.1994. However, liberty was\ngranted to the Management to proceed with the enquiry referred to in the\naward and to pass such order as it deemed appropriate in accordance with\nlaw. He, on this basis, presses that similar relief be granted to the\npetitioners. \nCounsel for the respondent, on the other hand, contends that the\npresent writ petition with regard to petitioners No.21 and 22 is not\nmaintainable as both these workmen had not appeared before the Labour\nCourt to support their assertions made in their demand notice. This factual\nposition having not been disputed by the counsel for the petitioner, writ\npetition on behalf of petitioners No.21 and 22 Vas Dev, Typist Yashpal\nSingh, Turner respectively, is held to be not maintainable and dismissed as\nsuch on the ground that the Labour Court in its award itself has on this very\nground answered the reference against these petitioners.\nCounsel for the respondent has further submitted that the award\npassed by the Labour Court is in accordance with law. He submits that\nbefore the Conciliation Officer the stand of the Management was that the\nworkmen have been charge-sheeted and enquiry proceedings were pending\nagainst them and the record in that regard was also produced before the\nConciliation Officer. He contends that the stand of the Management from\nthe very inception was that the services of the workmen have not been\nterminated and since the workmen were still in service when the reference\nwas made, there could have been no dispute under Section 10 of the Act.\nC.W.P.No.5829 of 1993\n-4-\nAfter the said reference had been made by the Appropriate Government, the\nLabour Court on going through the records and the evidence led before it,\nhas come to a conclusion that the reference was pre-mature on the ground\nthat the termination of the workmen was not there.\nI have heard learned counsel for the parties and with their able\nassistance have gone through the records of the case as well as the\nimpugned award. A perusal of the same would clearly show that MW-1\nShri Ranjit Singh, a Clerk of the local Labour Office, had appeared before\nthe Labour Court and produced the records of the conciliation proceedings\nin the form of Exhibit M-1. Shri J.K.Sehgal, MW-2 had appeared before the\nLabour Court and produced various documents showing the charge-sheets\nand the notices issued to different workmen in relation to initiation of\ndomestic enquiries against them. Even during the pendency of the\nproceedings before the Labour Court, it is apparent that the enquiries were\npending before the workmen. The workmen in their cross-examination have\nadmitted that show cause notices and charge-sheets regarding initiation of\nenquiries against them were either received by them or the said charge-\nsheets were dispatched on their correct addresses. However, this does\nindicate that the workmen were aware of the domestic enquiries being\ninitiated and continuation thereof against them. Despite this knowledge, the\nworkmen had proceeded to raise an industrial dispute claiming therein that\ntheir services have been terminated. The finding as recorded by the Labour\nCourt, therefore, cannot be faulted with that the reference was pre-mature as\nthe services of the workmen were not terminated on the date(s) alleged by\nthem or on the date(s) when the reference was made. That being so, the\nonly conclusion which can be arrived at and has rightly been reached by the\nC.W.P.No.5829 of 1993\n-5-\nLabour Court is that the reference was pre-mature. That being the position,\nno illegality can be said to have been committed by the Labour Court in\npassing Award dated 21.12.1992 (Annexure P-9).\nThe contention of the counsel for the petitioners that in the case\nof similarly placed employees, the reference has been answered in favour of\nthe workmen and against the Management although the grounds taken\ntherein were on the same lines as in the present proceedings. A perusal of\nthe said award ( Annexure P-10) would show that the Court has proceeded\nto decide the case as per the pleadings before the said Court. This order,\nwhen challenged before this Court in C.W.P.No.7289 of 1993 which came\nto be decided on 12.1.1994, this order also says that the enquiries which\nhas been referred to in the award were still continuing against the workmen\nand the Court has also given liberty to the Management to proceed with the\nenquiries and to pass such orders as it deems appropriate in accordance with\nlaw. This further shows that as a matter of fact, there was no termination in\nthat case as well. However, this Court in exercise of its discretionary\npowers under Article 226 of the Constitution of India refrained itself from\nexercising its writ jurisdiction. \nIn view of the above, the present writ petition is without any\nmerit and is hereby dismissed.\nHowever, a liberty is given to the Management to proceed in\naccordance with the findings, if any, against the workmen.\nFebruary 11, 2009\n\n ( AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH )\npoonam\n JUDGE\n\nWhether referred to Reporters ________ Yes/No"
