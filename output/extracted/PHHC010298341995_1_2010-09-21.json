Abhohar having its regional office\nin Sector 35, Chandigarh through Sh. R.C. Gupta, Law Officer, duly\nconstituted attorney\n\n......Appellant\nVersus\nBimla Devi widow of Kharati Lal and others\n......Respondents\nPresent: Mr. Neeraj Khanna, Advocate for \nMr. Ravinder Arora, Advocate \nfor the appellant.\nNone for the respondents.\nCORAM:HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN\n.\nWhether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the\njudgment ? \n. \nTo be referred to the Reporters or not ? \n.\nWhether the judgment should be reported in the Digest? \n-.-\nK. KANNAN J.(ORAL)\n.\nThe insurance company is challenging the award on the\nissue of liability. At the trial, report of the licensing authority was\nproduced to the effect that the particular licence No.6739 said to\nhave been issued in the name of the driver had in fact been issued in\nthe name of some other person and not in the name of the driver of\nthe offending vehicle. The Tribunal, on examining the document\nobserved that the licence of the driver bore the date of issue on\n.10.1987 and the report brought form the licensing authority,\ntherefore, was not a proper verification of the particular date on\nwhich the licence of the driver had been issued. Even without\nFAO No.1340 of 1995\n-2-\njoining on the issue of discrepancy, I am still not convinced that the\ninsurer had discharged the burden of proof effectively enough. A\ncommunication from the licensing authority that the particular\nlicence was verified, cannot be taken at its face value and it has to\nbe established before the Tribunal through appropriate evidence by\nsummoning the original register and getting a witness connected\nwith the document to speak about the entry. The insurer cannot be\nsaid to have discharged the burden of proof properly and I would\nhold the insurer liable not merely to satisfy the claim of the\nclaimants but also to indemnify the insured.\n.\nThe award is confirmed and the appeal is dismissed.\n(K.KANNAN)\n JUDGE\nSeptember 21, 2010\nPankaj*"
