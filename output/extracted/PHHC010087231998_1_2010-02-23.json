    "that of the prosecutrix was having a height of three feet. Sunil Kumar Bhatnagar, Draftsman PW-11 had prepared the scaled site plan of the spot Ex.PO. Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix was given up as won-over. The Public Prosecutor had placed on record report Ex.PK of the Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban, Haryana, wherein it was stated that human semen was detected on multicoloured terrycot Salwar and on yellow/brown nylon underwear. Thereafter, prosecution closed its evidence. Statement of the accused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating circumstances were put to him. He denied the same and projected the following version in his statement: Yes. I am innocent. I have been falsely implicated in this case only to save Bansi s/o Sube Singh who is friend and Guru of the husband of the prosecutrix in motor driving, as there was case against him under Section 377 IPC and in charge of P.S. Sahalwas Jagdish Chander was relative of my village and interested in compromise in the case under Section 377 IPC. Both parties were apprehended from the village on the same day but they were sent to home in evening and I was kept in Thana more than 5 and 6 days. In defence, Jagminder Singh Draftsman was examined as DW-1. He proved the site plan Ex.D1. This witness stated that the door of the house of accused faces the street towards the Northern side of his house. Thereafter, there is a small turning at the northern-western corner of the house of accused and thereafter, the street goes to the door of the house of prosecutrix. Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 Mauji Ram DW-2 stated that as a Sarpanch, he had not heard of any incident. This witness stated that it was not in his knowledge that the accused and cousin of Nahnu Ram were challaned under Section /151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had only heard about a family dispute. Het Ram DW-3 stated that he had learnt that Taqdir had been challaned under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had heard nothing about the accused. In cross examination, this witness stated that there was no case registered against the accused under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. Sabha Chand Chaukidar DW-4 stated that the circumstances regarding arrest of the accused were not in his knowledge. I have heard counsel for the parties. Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate appearing for the appellant, has stated that the prosecutrix was aged about 19-20 years. It is further submitted that at the time of incident, prosecutrix was 21 weeks pregnant. It is submitted that according to the prosecution story, accused came to the house of the prosecutrix at 11.00 p.m. He had tied the hands of the prosecutrix with a cloth and had allegedly gagged her mouth with the cloth. It is contended that according to the prosecutrix, the accused while leaving, had untied her hands and had removed the cloth from her mouth, still the prosecutrix had raised no noise to attract anybody and narrate the incident. These circumstances according to the counsel, make the version projected by the prosecutrix unnatural, improbable and unconvincing. It is urged that this Court should appreciate the arguments in light of the fact that for four days, the prosecutrix had not reported the matter to the police. The occurrence had taken place on 3rd May, 1996, whereas, the report was lodged with the police on 7th May, 1996. Counsel has further stated that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles and ring of little finger were broken at the spot Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 and the same were taken into possession by the Investigating Officer. This fact was also reiterated by Nahna Ram PW-5, husband of the prosecutrix. But ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 had stated in categoric terms that no bangles were taken into possession and the same were not found at the spot. This according to the counsel, is a material contradiction between the testimony of three prime witnesses examined by the prosecution. Furthermore, it was averred that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles had caused injuries on her arms but no such injury was found in the medico legal report, therefore, the medical evidence in no way corroborates the ocular version. It is submitted that vaginal swabs were sent to the laboratory but no semen was found. There were no external or internal marks of injury suffered by the prosecutrix. It is further submitted that Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, to whom the occurrence was narrated for the first time, was not examined by the prosecution. Even brother of husband of the prosecutrix, who had relayed the information to Nahnu Ram, husband of the prosecutrix, at the place of his avocation, was not examined. Adding force to the above stated arguments, it is urged that the suggestions given by the accused and the version narrated by him in his statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. assumes importance, as present and the former Sarpanch of the village had appeared in defence as DW-2 and DW-3 respectively and stated that no occurrence had taken place. This according to the counsel, belies the explanation furnished by the prosecutrix to explain the delay that the villagers had prompted her to lodge the report so that the culprit should be punished. Counsel for the State has urged that the testimony of prosecutrix aspires confidence and can be relied upon without any corroboration. Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 There are certain features of this case, which compel this Court to arrive at a conclusion that the testimony of the prosecutrix can be relied upon without any corroboration: (a) Father of the accused and the father of husband of the prosecutrix were brothers, therefore, the accused and husband of the prosecutrix are closely related. (b) On the day of occurrence, in connection with his avocation, husband of the prosecutrix had gone out of the village and the prosecutrix was alone at her house when in the night accused had trespassed into her house. (c) The version projected regarding the alleged inimical relations has not been proved by the defence. No copy of the FIR, report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. or the Court proceedings has been placed on record to prove that the alleged friend (Ustad) of husband of the prosecutrix was involved in a case under Section 377 Cr.P.C. Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that the prosecutrix and her husband will level false allegations of rape to absolve a friend of the husband, especially when the accused is closely related to them. Thus, except a bald suggestion and a version under Section Cr.P.C., nothing has been brought on record to corroborate the same. The suggestion propounded by the defence and the version given under Section 313 Cr.P.C. are to be rejected, being not probable. Once this Court has held that the relations between the parties were normal, then it is difficult to believe that the Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 prosecutrix will put reputation of her family at stake by leveling false allegations. (d) It is not the case of the accused that it is a case of consent. The arguments raised by the defence counsel that there was a delay of four days in lodging the report to the police; no injury on the person of the prosecutrix was found in the medical evidence, therefore, she had not offered any resistance; the bangles were not recovered and that the defence witnesses have belied the version of the prosecutrix, are to be rejected in the context of circumstances enumerated above. The Hon ble Apex Court, in State of Maharasthra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550, observed as under: 15. It is necessary at the outset to state what the approach of the court should be while evaluating the prosecution evidence, particularly the evidence of the prosecutrix, in sex offences. Is it essential that the evidence of the prosecutrix should be corroborated in material particulars before the court bases a conviction on her testimony ? Does the rule of prudence demand that in all cases save the rarest of rare the court should look for corroboration before acting on the evidence of the prosecutrix ? Let us see if the Evidence Act provides the clue. Under the said statute Evidence means and includes all statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses, in relation to the matters of fact under inquiry. Under Section 59 all facts, except the contents of documents, may be proved by oral evidence. Section 118 then tells us who may give oral evidence. According to that section all persons are competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them, or from giving rational answers to those questions, by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind. Even in the case of an accomplice Section Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 provides that he shall be a competent witness against an accused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice. However, illustration (b) to Section 114, which lays down a rule of practice, says that the court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is corroborated in material particulars. Thus under Section 133, which lays down a rule of law, an accomplice is a competent witness and a conviction based solely on his uncorroborated evidence is not illegal although in view of Section 114, illustration (b), courts do not as a matter of practice do so and look for corroboration in material particulars. This is the conjoint effect of Sections 133 and 114, illustration (b). . A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to illustration (b) to Section 114 which requires it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no doubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix who does not lack understanding must be accepted. The degree of proof required must not be higher than is expected of an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that exception has rightly been taken to the approach of the High Court as is reflected in the following passage: It is only in the rarest of rare cases if the court finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is so trustworthy, truthful and reliable that other corroboration may not be necessary. With respect, the law is not correctly stated. If we may say so, it is just the reverse. Ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an injured person who is a victim of violence, unless there are special circumstances which call for greater caution, in which case it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is independent evidence lending assurance to her accusation. . We think it proper, having regard to the increase in the number of sex violation cases in the recent past, particularly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to remove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman who is a victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be corroborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare cases. To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare cases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust of another with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult womanhood. It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman that her story of woe will not be believed unless it is corroborated in material particulars as in the case of an accomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where it concerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society as in some of the western and European countries. Our Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 standard of decency and morality in public life is not the same as in those countries. It is, however, unfortunate that respect for womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases of molestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman is now required to suffer indignities in different forms, from lewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape. Decency and morality in public life can be promoted and protected only if we deal strictly with those who violate the societal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the court in such cases must take into account the fact that such crimes are generally committed on the sly and very rarely direct evidence of a person other than the prosecutrix is available. Courts must also realise that ordinarily a woman, more so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling a false charge concerning her chastity. In the light of the observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court above, this Court cannot ignore that on the Salwar and underwear of the prosecutrix, human semen was detected. It is not necessary that in every case, vaginal swabs must contain semen. Sometimes the accused may discharge the semen outside the vagina. No question to this effect was asked to the prosecutrix. Furthermore, it was stated by the prosecutrix that her hands were tied and her legs were weak, therefore, she could not offer resistance to the accused, who was a well built young man. Non- examination of Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, and elder brother (cousin) (Jeth) of husband of the prosecutrix, is also of no consequence as the testimony of the prosecutrix corroborated by her husband is sufficient for reliance, as the same aspires confidence. In Gita Ram v. State of H.P. 2002 Cri.L.J.3832, Himachal Pradesh High Court has held that the delay in lodging of the report is of no consequence as victim of sexual assault face a lot of difficulty to come forward to depose against the accused, as the reputation of family of the prosecutrix is at stake. Relying upon the judgment rendered in State of Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 Punjab v. Gurmit Singh (1996) 2 SCC 384, Himachal Pradesh High Court observed as under: 22. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh , (1996) 2 SCC : (1996 Cri LJ 1728), their Lordships took note of the existing rate of crime against women and held : (SCC p 403, para 21) : (at Pp 1739-40, Para 20 of Cri LJ). 21. Of late, crime against women in general and rape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that while we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres, we show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad reflection on the attitude of indifference of the society towards the violation of human dignity of the victims of sex crimes. We must remember that a rapist not only violate the victim's privacy and personal integrity, but inevitably causes serious psychological as well as physical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a physical assault it is often destructive of the whole personality of the victim. A murderer destroys the physical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very soul of the helpless female. The Courts, therefore, shoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused on charges of rape. They must deal with such cases with utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the broader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by minor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal nature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of her statement in material particulars. If for some reason the Court finds it different to place implicit reliance on her testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony, short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of the prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background of the entire case and the trial Court must be alive to its responsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases involving sexual molestations. Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 Referring to an earlier judgment in State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550 : (1990 Cri LJ 889), the Supreme Court in Gurmit Singh case (1996 (2) SCC 384 : 1996 Cri LJ 1728) held : (SCC Pp 395- , paras 8-9) : (at p 1735, Para 7 of Cri LJ). The Courts must, while evaluating evidence, remain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self respecting woman would come forward in a Court just to make a humiliating statement against her honour such as is involved in the commission of rape on her. In cases involving sexual molestation, supposed considerations which have no material effect on the veracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies in the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless the discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be allowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution case. The inherent bashfulness of the females and the tendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are factors which the Courts should not overlook. The testimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless there are compelling reasons which necessitate looking for corroboration of her statement, the Courts should find no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of sexual assault alone to convict an accused where her testimony inspires confidence and is found to be reliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement before relying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases amounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the evidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or suspicion ? The Court while appreciating the evidence of a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her statement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is a witness who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to insist upon corroboration of her statement to base conviction of an accused. The evidence of a victim of Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 sexual assault stands almost on a par with the evidence of a injured witness and to an extent is even more reliable. Just as a witness who has sustained some injury in the occurrence, which is not found to be self inflicted, as considered to be a good witness in the sense that he is least likely to shield the real culprit, the evidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to great weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding. Corroborative evidence is not an imperative component of judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration as a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a guidance of prudence under given circumstances. It must not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected to sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person s lust and it is improper and undesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount of suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice. Interference have to be drawn from a given set of facts and circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead uniformity lest that type of rigidity in the shape of rule of law is introduced through a new form of testimonial tyranny making justice a casualty. Courts cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even, if, taken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of sex crime strikes the judicial mind as deprobable. In State of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990 (1) SCC 550 : 1990 Cri LJ 889), Ahmadi, J. (as the Lord Chief Justice then was) speaking for the Bench summarised the position in the following words : (SCC p 559, para 16 : (at Pp 894-95, Para 16 of Cri LJ). A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on a par with an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and her evidence must receive the Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of care of and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence as in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no more. What is necessary is that the Court must be alive to and conscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to Illustration (b) to Section 114 which required it to look for corroboration. If for some reason the Court is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look for evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short of corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The nature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony of the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding the Court is entitled to base a conviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be infirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances appearing on the record of the case disclose that the prosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve the person charged, the Court should ordinarily have no hesitation in accepting her evidence. We are in respectful agreement with the above exposition of law. In the instant case our careful analysis of the statement of the prosecutrix has created an impression on our minds that she is a reliable and truthful witness. Her testimony suffers from no infirmity or blemish whatsoever. We have no hesitation in acting upon her testimony alone without looking for any corroboration. However, in this case there is Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix. . In the light of the above said ratio of the decision of the Apex Court, I find that in the case on hand the testimony of the prosecutrix discussed hereinabove suffers from no infirmity and she is a reliable and truthful witness. There is ample corroboration available on the record to lend further credence to the testimony of the prosecutrix in the form of the deposition of PW 2 to whom the prosecutrix had narrated the incident in the evening on the same day and she disclosed the occurrence to her husband immediately after he returned from attending the fair. Medical evidence is not of much relevance for the reason that prosecutrix was examined by Dr. Shyam after about 24 days from the alleged day of occurrence and further because she is a married woman and was habitual of sexual inter course. In the present case, the prosecutrix was medico legally examined after four days of the occurrence. In Karnel Singh v. State of M.P. 1995(3) RCR (Criminal) , it was observed as under: 7. The submission overlooks the fact that in India women are slow and hesitant to complain of such assaults and if the prosecutrix happens to be a married person she will not do anything without informing her husband. Merely because the complaint was lodged less than promptly does not raise the inference that the complaint was false. The reluctance to go to the police is because of society s attitude towards such women; it casts doubt and shame upon her rather than comfort and sympathize with her. Therefore, delay in lodging complaints in such cases does not necessarily indicate that her version is false. In view of the observations of the Hon ble Apex Court, it is necessary to notice the judgments relied by the counsel for the appellant. Reliance has been placed upon Tameezuddin @ Tammu v. State of Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 (NCT) of Delhi 2009(4) RCR (Criminal) 345. A perusal of the said judgment reveals that the same is not attracted on the facts of the present case. Their Lordships of Hon ble Apex Court took into consideration the testimony of PW-1 prosecutrix where she told the appellant that everything was forgiven and forgotten. Another judgment relied by the counsel for the appellant rendered in State of Haryana v. Dilawar 2009(3) RCR (Criminal) 2001 is also not attracted, as the Court has given credence to the fact that Zile Singh PW-6 in that case had not supported the prosecution. Similarly Kishan v. State of Haryana 2009(3) RCR (Criminal) 480, a judgment rendered by a Single Bench of this Court is also not attracted on the facts of the present case, as it was held that the evidence of the prosecutrix was neither reliable nor trustworthy. It was further held that each case depends on its own facts and circumstances. Another judgment cited by counsel for the appellant, rendered by a Division Bench of Hon ble Apex Court in Pandurang Sitaram Bhagwat v. State of Maharashtra 2005(1) RCR (Criminal) 858 also states that each case is to be determined on the factual matrix of that case. This Court has already held that testimony of the prosecutrix aspires confidence, therefore, in view of the discussion made above and the observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court in the judgments relied, this Court is of the opinion that present appeal is devoid of any merit and is thus, liable to be dismissed. Counsel for the appellant has relied upon another judgment of this Court rendered in Balkar Singh v. State of Haryana 2007(4) RCR (Criminal) 597 to contend that taking into consideration long pendency of the trial, sentence awarded upon the appellant should be reduced to the minimum period prescribed. This Court is of the view that there are no special or adequate reasons to reduce the sentence awarded upon the accused appellant. It is Criminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998 not a case where the accused and the prosecutrix had eloped together. It is also not a case of love affair, where because the age of the prosecutrix was less therefore, the sentence should be reduced. In the present case, the appellant had committed offence of rape to satisfy his lust, therefore, there is no scope for reduction in sentence awarded to the accused appellant. Hence, this prayer is also declined. Dismissed. [KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA] JUDGE February 23, 2010 rps"

  "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA\nAT CHANDIGARH\nCriminal Appeal No. 691-SB of 1998\nDate of decision: 23rd February, 2010\nTaqdir Singh \n   Appellant \nVersus \nState of Haryana \n  Respondent\nCORAM: \nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA\nPresent:\nMrs. Baljit Kaur Mann, Advocate for the appellant.\nMs. Hemlata Balhara, Assistant Advocate General, Haryana\nfor the State.\nKANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. \nTaqdir Singh son of Lehri Singh has preferred the present\nappeal and has challenged the judgment of conviction and order of\nsentence dated 30th July, 1998, whereby he was held guilty of offence\nunder Section 452 and 376 IPC. The trial Court had sentenced the\nappellant under Section 452 IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a\nperiod of five years and to pay a fine of Rs.2000/-, in default of payment of\nfine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year. The appellant\nwas further sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of\nseven years and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine\nto further undergo rigorous imprisonment for 1   years under Section 376\nIPC. \nASI Devi Dutt PW-10 of Police Station Sahlawas was present\nat Jhajjar, when the prosecutrix PW-1 (whose name has been withheld to\nprotect her identity) along with her husband Nahnu Ram PW-5 appeared\nand made statement Ex.PA, on the basis of which FIR No.32 dated\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\n.05.1996 was registered at Police Station Sahlawas. The prosecutrix\nstated that her parents belong to Dadri Toe. About 11 months before the\noccurrence, she was married with Nahnu Ram. She was staying in her\nmatrimonial home at village Chandol. She had set up a separate\nresidence with her husband three months before the occurrence and her\nin-laws were residing in another house. On 3rd May, 1996 at about 4.00\np.m. her husband had gone to village Bhakli to do the work of Halwai\n(sweet maker) in a marriage and she was alone at her house. At about\n.00 p.m., she went to sleep in the courtyard after bolting the door of her\nhouse. She had retired to her bed after taking her meals. At about 11.00\np.m., she felt that somebody had put his hands on her mouth. At that time,\nthe present appellant, who was standing there, bent upon her and had\ngagged her mouth. At that time, the appellant was wearing underwear\nonly. When the prosecutrix tried to remove the hand of appellant from her\nmouth, he closed the mouth of the prosecutrix with a cloth and also tied\nboth of her hands with Charpai (cot) with a cloth. Due to scuffle, bangles in\nboth the hands of the prosecutrix and the ring in her little finger were\nbroken. Due to deformity of one knee, the prosecutrix could not provide\nresistance. The accused had broken the string of Salwar of the\nprosecutrix, removed her panty and forcibly committed sexual intercourse\nupon her. After the occurrence, the accused untied the hands of the\nprosecutrix, removed the cloth from her face and ran away from the spot.\nIn the next morning, the prosecutrix reached the house of her mother-in-\nlaw Sunehri and narrated the entire incident to her. Thereupon, a man was\nsent to village Bhakli to call the husband of the prosecutrix. Feeling harm\nto her reputation in the society, the prosecutrix remained at her house,\nsince the entire village knew about the incident and on the persuasion of\nthe people that the guilty should be punished, the prosecutrix complainant\nalong with her husband came forward to lodge the matter with the police.\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nShe was going to the Police Station to lodge the report when the police\nofficials met her and she got her statement recorded. It was further stated\nthat Taqdir had left his house from the day of incident and was not\navailable. \nIn the present case, occurrence had taken place on 3rd May,\nat about 11.00 p.m. The prosecutrix had made statement Ex.PA to\nASI Devi Dutt PW-10 on 7th May, 1996 at 1.20 p.m. Case was registered\nat Police Station Sahlawas on 7th May, 1996 at 3.30 p.m. \nThe above said FIR was investigated and report under\nSection 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted against the accused appellant. \nThe case, along with the accused, was committed to the\nCourt of Sessions Judge, Rohtak and was entrusted for trial to the Court of\nAdditional Sessions Judge, Rohtak. On 19th September, 1996, the trial\nJudge charged the appellant for offence under Section 452 and 376 IPC.\nThe charge stated that on 3rd May, 1996 at about 11.00 p.m. in the area of\nvillage Chandol, the appellant committed house-trespass by entering the\nhouse of the prosecutrix, used as human dwelling, having made\npreparation to wrongfully restrain the prosecutrix and thereby committed\nan offence punishable under Section 452 IPC. It was further stated that on\nthe same day, time and place, he had committed offence of rape\npunishable under Section 376 IPC. \nThe appellant pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. \nProsecutrix appeared as PW-1 and reiterated as to what was\nstated in her statement Ex.PA, contents of which have been noticed\nabove. She further sated that Taqdir was her neighbour. In cross\nexamination, this witness admitted that her mother had got a case\nregistered against Hari Singh and Smt. Bala wife of Hari Singh on the\naccusation that Hari Singh had given a kick blow in the stomach of mother\nof the prosecutrix, due to which she got aborted and the child died. She\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\ndenied the suggestion that earlier her mother had compromised the matter\nafter acceptance of money. This witness further stated that when the\naccused appeared near her cot, he was having a 5 feet long Parna (cloth)\nin his hand. She further stated that the elder brother of her husband was\nsent to relay the information to her husband. She further deposed that due\nto breakage of her bangles at the time of incident, she had sustained\ninjuries on her arm s skin but the injuries did not bleed. It was stated that\nher underwear and Salwar were stained with semen. The police had taken\ninto possession the broken bangles, ring and clothes from the house of\nprosecutrix. She denied the suggestion that she had lodged false case\nagainst the accused to save Bansi son of Sube, a driver and accused in a\ncase under Section 377 IPC. Bansi is stated to be Ustad (teacher) of\nhusband of the prosecutrix as he allegedly used to impart lessons to him\nin driving. She further stated that it was not in her knowledge that Bansi\nwas named as accused for having committed unnatural intercourse with\nson of the accused. \nHead Constable Bharat Singh PW-2, Constable Nafe Singh\nPW-3 and Constable Krishan Kumar PW-4 tendered their affidavits Ex.PB,\nPC and PD respectively to prove link evidence. \nNahnu Ram, husband of the prosecutrix appeared as PW-5.\nHe stated that on 3rd May, 1996, he had gone to village Bhakli to do the job\nof Halwai (sweet maker). On 4th May, 1996 at about 4.00 p.m., he received\nthe information through his cousin Ram Kishan and came back to his\nhouse at 6.30 p.m. He divulged the occurrence to the Sarpanch and other\nrespectables of the village and on their advice that the culprit should be\npunished, he along with his wife proceeded to the Police Station, when on\nthe way police party met him and his wife got recorded the statement to\nthe police. In cross examination, this witness stated that the broken\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nbangles were put in a match box by a Sub Inspector. He admitted that his\nfather and the father of accused Taqdir were real brothers. \nDr.Aruna Sangwan, Medical Officer, Community Health\nCentre, Jhajjar PW-6 medico legally examined the prosecutrix on 7th May,\nat 3.45 p.m. No external mark of injury was found, except that there\nwas an old fracture on the right thigh with shortening. In examination of\nexternal organs, a whitish discharge was found present in the vagina. Old\ntags of hymen were present. Vagina admitted two fingers. Vaginal swabs\nfrom posterior fornix were taken. Sample of the pubic hair of the\nprosecutrix was also taken. This witness stated that since the prosecutrix\nhad changed her clothes, they were not taken into possession. This\nwitness had not ruled out the possibility of prosecutrix having sexual\nintercourse. In cross examination, this witness stated that there was no\nexternal mark of injury on the body of the prosecutrix and there was no\nsemen mark on her thigh. \nSI Jagdish Chander PW-7 had prepared the report under\nSection 173 Cr.P.C. \nASI Sumer Singh PW-8 proved registration of the formal FIR\nEx.PA/1 on receipt of ruqa Ex.PA. \nDr.Ram Kumar, Medical Officer PW-9 had examined the\naccused appellant and had opined that there was nothing to suggest that\nthe accused was not fit to perform sexual intercourse. \nASI Devi Dutt PW-10 was the Investigating Officer. He\ndeposed regarding various facets of the investigation. This witness further\nstated that on 13th May, 1996, he had arrested the accused. This witness\nstated that when he had inspected the spot, he had not found any broken\nbangles. This witness admitted that the house of the accused and the door\nof house of the prosecutrix open in the same street. He stated that the\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nboundary wall between the houses of the accused and that of the\nprosecutrix was having a height of three feet. \nSunil Kumar Bhatnagar, Draftsman PW-11 had prepared the\nscaled site plan of the spot Ex.PO. \nSunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix was given up\nas won-over. \nThe Public Prosecutor had placed on record report Ex.PK of\nthe Forensic Science Laboratory, Madhuban, Haryana, wherein it was\nstated that human semen was detected on multicoloured terrycot Salwar\nand on yellow/brown nylon underwear. \nThereafter, prosecution closed its evidence. Statement of the\naccused under Section 313 Cr.P.C. was recorded and all incriminating\ncircumstances were put to him. He denied the same and projected the\nfollowing version in his statement: \n Yes. I am innocent. I have been falsely implicated in\nthis case only to save Bansi s/o Sube Singh who is friend and\nGuru of the husband of the prosecutrix in motor driving, as\nthere was case against him under Section 377 IPC and in\ncharge of P.S. Sahalwas Jagdish Chander was relative of my\nvillage and interested in compromise in the case under\nSection 377 IPC. Both parties were apprehended from the\nvillage on the same day but they were sent to home in evening\nand I was kept in Thana more than 5 and 6 days.  \nIn defence, Jagminder Singh Draftsman was examined as\nDW-1. He proved the site plan Ex.D1. This witness stated that the door of\nthe house of accused faces the street towards the Northern side of his\nhouse. Thereafter, there is a small turning at the northern-western corner\nof the house of accused and thereafter, the street goes to the door of the\nhouse of prosecutrix. \nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nMauji Ram DW-2 stated that as a Sarpanch, he had not heard\nof any incident. This witness stated that it was not in his knowledge that\nthe accused and cousin of Nahnu Ram were challaned under Section\n/151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that he had only heard about a\nfamily dispute. \nHet Ram DW-3 stated that he had learnt that Taqdir had been\nchallaned under Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. This witness further stated that\nhe had heard nothing about the accused. In cross examination, this\nwitness stated that there was no case registered against the accused\nunder Section 107/151 Cr.P.C. \nSabha Chand Chaukidar DW-4 stated that the circumstances\nregarding arrest of the accused were not in his knowledge. \nI have heard counsel for the parties. Mrs. Baljit Kaur Mann,\nAdvocate appearing for the appellant, has stated that the prosecutrix was\naged about 19-20 years. It is further submitted that at the time of incident,\nprosecutrix was 21 weeks  pregnant. It is submitted that according to the\nprosecution story, accused came to the house of the prosecutrix at 11.00\np.m. He had tied the hands of the prosecutrix with a cloth and had\nallegedly gagged her mouth with the cloth. It is contended that according\nto the prosecutrix, the accused while leaving, had untied her hands and\nhad removed the cloth from her mouth, still the prosecutrix had raised no\nnoise to attract anybody and narrate the incident. These circumstances\naccording to the counsel, make the version projected by the prosecutrix\nunnatural, improbable and unconvincing. It is urged that this Court should\nappreciate the arguments in light of the fact that for four days, the\nprosecutrix had not reported the matter to the police. The occurrence had\ntaken place on 3rd May, 1996, whereas, the report was lodged with the\npolice on 7th May, 1996. Counsel has further stated that according to the\nprosecutrix, her bangles and ring of little finger were broken at the spot\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nand the same were taken into possession by the Investigating Officer. This\nfact was also reiterated by Nahna Ram PW-5, husband of the prosecutrix.\nBut ASI Devi Dutt PW-10 had stated in categoric terms that no bangles\nwere taken into possession and the same were not found at the spot. This\naccording to the counsel, is a material contradiction between the testimony\nof three prime witnesses examined by the prosecution. Furthermore, it\nwas averred that according to the prosecutrix, her bangles had caused\ninjuries on her arms but no such injury was found in the medico legal\nreport, therefore, the medical evidence in no way corroborates the ocular\nversion. It is submitted that vaginal swabs were sent to the laboratory but\nno semen was found. There were no external or internal marks of injury\nsuffered by the prosecutrix. It is further submitted that Sunehri Devi,\nmother-in-law of the prosecutrix, to whom the occurrence was narrated for\nthe first time, was not examined by the prosecution. Even brother of\nhusband of the prosecutrix, who had relayed the information to Nahnu\nRam, husband of the prosecutrix, at the place of his avocation, was not\nexamined. \nAdding force to the above stated arguments, it is urged that\nthe suggestions given by the accused and the version narrated by him in\nhis statement recorded under Section 313 Cr.P.C. assumes importance,\nas present and the former Sarpanch of the village had appeared in\ndefence as DW-2 and DW-3 respectively and stated that no occurrence\nhad taken place. This according to the counsel, belies the explanation\nfurnished by the prosecutrix to explain the delay that the villagers had\nprompted her to lodge the report so that the culprit should be punished. \nCounsel for the State has urged that the testimony of\nprosecutrix aspires confidence and can be relied upon without any\ncorroboration. \nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nThere are certain features of this case, which compel this\nCourt to arrive at a conclusion that the testimony of the prosecutrix can be\nrelied upon without any corroboration:\n(a)\nFather of the accused and the father of husband of the\nprosecutrix were brothers, therefore, the accused and\nhusband of the prosecutrix are closely related. \n(b)\nOn the day of occurrence, in connection with his\navocation, husband of the prosecutrix had gone out of\nthe village and the prosecutrix was alone at her house\nwhen in the night accused had trespassed into her\nhouse. \n(c)\nThe version projected regarding the alleged inimical\nrelations has not been proved by the defence. No copy\nof the FIR, report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. or the\nCourt proceedings has been placed on record to prove\nthat the alleged friend (Ustad) of husband of the\nprosecutrix was involved in a case under Section 377\nCr.P.C. Furthermore, it is difficult to believe that the\nprosecutrix and her husband will level false allegations\nof rape to absolve a friend of the husband, especially\nwhen the accused is closely related to them. Thus,\nexcept a bald suggestion and a version under Section\nCr.P.C., nothing has been brought on record to\ncorroborate the same. The suggestion propounded by\nthe defence and the version given under Section 313\nCr.P.C. are to be rejected, being not probable. Once\nthis Court has held that the relations between the\nparties were normal, then it is difficult to believe that the\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nprosecutrix will put reputation of her family at stake by\nleveling false allegations. \n(d)\nIt is not the case of the accused that it is a case of\nconsent. \nThe arguments raised by the defence counsel that there was\na delay of four days in lodging the report to the police; no injury on the\nperson of the prosecutrix was found in the medical evidence, therefore,\nshe had not offered any resistance; the bangles were not recovered and\nthat the defence witnesses have belied the version of the prosecutrix, are\nto be rejected in the context of circumstances enumerated above. \nThe Hon ble Apex Court, in  State of Maharasthra v.\nChandraprakash Kewalchand Jain  (1990) 1 SCC 550, observed as\nunder: \n 15. It is necessary at the outset to state what the\napproach of the court should be while evaluating the\nprosecution evidence, particularly the evidence of the\nprosecutrix, in sex offences. Is it essential that the evidence of\nthe prosecutrix should be corroborated in material particulars\nbefore the court bases a conviction on her testimony ? Does\nthe rule of prudence demand that in all cases save the rarest\nof rare the court should look for corroboration before acting on\nthe evidence of the prosecutrix ? Let us see if the Evidence\nAct provides the clue. Under the said statute  Evidence  means\nand includes all statements which the court permits or requires\nto be made before it by witnesses, in relation to the matters of\nfact under inquiry. Under Section 59 all facts, except the\ncontents of documents, may be proved by oral evidence.\nSection 118 then tells us who may give oral evidence.\nAccording to that section all persons are competent to testify\nunless the court considers that they are prevented from\nunderstanding the questions put to them, or from giving\nrational answers to those questions, by tender years, extreme\nold age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause\nof the same kind. Even in the case of an accomplice Section\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nprovides that he shall be a competent witness against an\naccused person; and a conviction is not illegal merely because\nit proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an\naccomplice. However, illustration (b) to Section 114, which\nlays down a rule of practice, says that the court  may  presume\nthat an accomplice is unworthy of credit, unless he is\ncorroborated in material particulars. Thus under Section 133,\nwhich lays down a rule of law, an accomplice is a competent\nwitness and a conviction based solely on his uncorroborated\nevidence is not illegal although in view of Section 114,\nillustration (b), courts do not as a matter of practice do so and\nlook for corroboration in material particulars. This is the\nconjoint effect of Sections 133 and 114, illustration (b).\n. A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be put on par\nwith an accomplice. She is in fact a victim of the crime. The\nEvidence Act nowhere says that her evidence cannot be\naccepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She\nis undoubtedly a competent witness under Section 118 and\nher evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to\nan injured in cases of physical violence. The same degree of\ncare and caution must attach in the evaluation of her evidence\nas in the case of an injured complainant or witness and no\nmore. What is necessary is that the court must be alive to and\nconscious of the fact that it is dealing with the evidence of a\nperson who is interested in the outcome of the charge levelled\nby her. If the court keeps this in mind and feels satisfied that it\ncan act on the evidence of the prosecutrix, there is no rule of\nlaw or practice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar to\nillustration (b) to Section 114 which requires it to look for\ncorroboration. If for some reason the court is hesitant to place\nimplicit reliance on the testimony of the prosecutrix it may look\nfor evidence which may lend assurance to her testimony short\nof corroboration required in the case of an accomplice. The\nnature of evidence required to lend assurance to the testimony\nof the prosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case. But if a prosecutrix is an adult\nand of full understanding the court is entitled to base a\nconviction on her evidence unless the same is shown to be\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\ninfirm and not trustworthy. If the totality of the circumstances\nappearing on the record of the case disclose that the\nprosecutrix does not have a strong motive to falsely involve\nthe person charged, the court should ordinarily have no\nhesitation in accepting her evidence. We have, therefore, no\ndoubt in our minds that ordinarily the evidence of a prosecutrix\nwho does not lack understanding must be accepted. The\ndegree of proof required must not be higher than is expected\nof an injured witness. For the above reasons we think that\nexception has rightly been taken to the approach of the High\nCourt as is reflected in the following passage:\n It is only in the rarest of rare cases if the\ncourt finds that the testimony of the prosecutrix is\nso trustworthy, truthful and reliable that other\ncorroboration may not be necessary. \nWith respect, the law is not correctly stated. If we may\nsay so, it is just the reverse. Ordinarily the evidence of a\nprosecutrix must carry the same weight as is attached to an\ninjured person who is a victim of violence, unless there are\nspecial circumstances which call for greater caution, in which\ncase it would be safe to act on her testimony if there is\nindependent evidence lending assurance to her accusation.\n. We think it proper, having regard to the increase in\nthe number of sex violation cases in the recent past,\nparticularly cases of molestation and rape in custody, to\nremove the notion, if it persists, that the testimony of a woman\nwho is a victim of sexual violence must ordinarily be\ncorroborated in material particulars except in the rarest of rare\ncases. To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare\ncases is to equate a woman who is a victim of the lust of\nanother with an accomplice to a crime and thereby insult\nwomanhood. It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman\nthat her story of woe will not be believed unless it is\ncorroborated in material particulars as in the case of an\naccomplice to a crime. Ours is a conservative society where it\nconcerns sexual behaviour. Ours is not a permissive society\nas in some of the western and European countries. Our\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nstandard of decency and morality in public life is not the same\nas in those countries. It is, however, unfortunate that respect\nfor womanhood in our country is on the decline and cases of\nmolestation and rape are steadily growing. An Indian woman\nis now required to suffer indignities in different forms, from\nlewd remarks to eve-teasing, from molestation to rape.\nDecency and morality in public life can be promoted and\nprotected only if we deal strictly with those who violate the\nsocietal norms. The standard of proof to be expected by the\ncourt in such cases must take into account the fact that such\ncrimes are generally committed on the sly and very rarely\ndirect evidence of a person other than the prosecutrix is\navailable. Courts must also realise that ordinarily a woman,\nmore so a young girl, will not stake her reputation by levelling\na false charge concerning her chastity. \nIn the light of the observations made by the Hon ble Apex\nCourt above, this Court cannot ignore that on the Salwar and underwear of\nthe prosecutrix, human semen was detected. It is not necessary that in\nevery case, vaginal swabs must contain semen. Sometimes the accused\nmay discharge the semen outside the vagina. No question to this effect\nwas asked to the prosecutrix. Furthermore, it was stated by the prosecutrix\nthat her hands were tied and her legs were weak, therefore, she could not\noffer resistance to the accused, who was a well built young man. Non-\nexamination of Sunehri Devi, mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, and elder\nbrother (cousin) (Jeth) of husband of the prosecutrix, is also of no\nconsequence as the testimony of the prosecutrix corroborated by her\nhusband is sufficient for reliance, as the same aspires confidence. \nIn  Gita Ram v. State of H.P.  2002 Cri.L.J.3832, Himachal\nPradesh High Court has held that the delay in lodging of the report is of no\nconsequence as victim of sexual assault face a lot of difficulty to come\nforward to depose against the accused, as the reputation of family of the\nprosecutrix is at stake. Relying upon the judgment rendered in  State of\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nPunjab v. Gurmit Singh  (1996) 2 SCC 384, Himachal Pradesh High\nCourt observed as under: \n 22. In State of Punjab v. Gurmit Singh , (1996) 2 SCC\n: (1996 Cri LJ 1728), their Lordships took note of the\nexisting rate of crime against women and held : (SCC p 403,\npara 21) : (at Pp 1739-40, Para 20 of Cri LJ).\n 21. Of late, crime against women in general and\nrape in particular is on the increase. It is an irony that\nwhile we are celebrating women's rights in all spheres,\nwe show little or no concern for her honour. It is a sad\nreflection on the attitude of indifference of the society\ntowards the violation of human dignity of the victims of\nsex crimes. We must remember that a rapist not only\nviolate the victim's privacy and personal integrity, but\ninevitably causes serious psychological as well as\nphysical harm in the process. Rape is not merely a\nphysical assault it is often destructive of the whole\npersonality of the victim. A murderer destroys the\nphysical body of his victim, a rapist degrades the very\nsoul of the helpless female. The Courts, therefore,\nshoulder a great responsibility while trying an accused\non charges of rape. They must deal with such cases\nwith utmost sensitivity. The Courts should examine the\nbroader probabilities of a case and not get swayed by\nminor contradictions or insignificant discrepancies in the\nstatement of the prosecutrix, which are not of a fatal\nnature, to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution\ncase. If evidence of the prosecutrix inspires confidence,\nit must be relied upon without seeking corroboration of\nher statement in material particulars. If for some reason\nthe Court finds it different to place implicit reliance on\nher testimony, it may look for evidence which may lend\nassurance to her testimony, short of corroboration\nrequired in the case of an accomplice. The testimony of\nthe prosecutrix must be appreciated in the background\nof the entire case and the trial Court must be alive to its\nresponsibility and be sensitive while dealing with cases\ninvolving sexual molestations. \nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nReferring to an earlier judgment in State of Maharashtra\nv. Chandraprakash Kewalchand Jain (1990) 1 SCC 550 :\n(1990 Cri LJ 889), the Supreme Court in Gurmit Singh case\n(1996 (2) SCC 384 : 1996 Cri LJ 1728) held : (SCC Pp 395-\n, paras 8-9) : (at p 1735, Para 7 of Cri LJ).\n The Courts must, while evaluating evidence,\nremain alive to the fact that in a case of rape, no self\nrespecting woman would come forward in a Court just to\nmake a humiliating statement against her honour such\nas is involved in the commission of rape on her. In\ncases involving sexual molestation, supposed\nconsiderations which have no material effect on the\nveracity of the prosecution case or even discrepancies\nin the statement of the prosecutrix should not, unless\nthe discrepancies are such which are of fatal nature, be\nallowed to throw out an otherwise reliable prosecution\ncase. The inherent bashfulness of the females and the\ntendency to conceal outrage of sexual aggression are\nfactors which the Courts should not overlook. The\ntestimony of the victim in such cases is vital and unless\nthere are compelling reasons which necessitate looking\nfor corroboration of her statement, the Courts should\nfind no difficulty to act on the testimony of a victim of\nsexual assault alone to convict an accused where her\ntestimony inspires confidence and is found to be\nreliable. Seeking corroboration of her statement before\nrelying upon the same, as a rule, in such cases\namounts to adding insult to injury. Why should the\nevidence of a girl or a woman who complains of rape or\nsexual molestation, be viewed with doubt, disbelief or\nsuspicion ? The Court while appreciating the evidence\nof a prosecutrix may look for some assurance of her\nstatement to satisfy its judicial conscience, since she is\na witness who is interested in the outcome of the charge\nlevelled by her, but there is no requirement of law to\ninsist upon corroboration of her statement to base\nconviction of an accused. The evidence of a victim of\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nsexual assault stands almost on a par with the evidence\nof a injured witness and to an extent is even more\nreliable. Just as a witness who has sustained some\ninjury in the occurrence, which is not found to be self\ninflicted, as considered to be a good witness in the\nsense that he is least likely to shield the real culprit, the\nevidence of a victim of a sexual offence is entitled to\ngreat weight, absence of corroboration notwithstanding.\nCorroborative evidence is not an imperative component\nof judicial credence in every case of rape. Corroboration\nas a condition for judicial reliance on the testimony of\nthe prosecutrix is not a requirement of law but a\nguidance of prudence under given circumstances. It\nmust not be overlooked that a woman or a girl subjected\nto sexual assault is not an accomplice to the crime but\nis a victim of another person s lust and it is improper and\nundesirable to test her evidence with a certain amount\nof suspicion, treating her as if she were an accomplice.\nInterference have to be drawn from a given set of facts\nand circumstances with realistic diversity and not dead\nuniformity lest that type of rigidity in the shape of rule of\nlaw is introduced through a new form of testimonial\ntyranny making justice a casualty. Courts cannot cling to\na fossil formula and insist upon corroboration even, if,\ntaken as a whole, the case spoken of by the victim of\nsex crime strikes the judicial mind as deprobable. In\nState of Maharashtra v. Chandraprakash Kewalchand\nJain (1990 (1) SCC 550 : 1990 Cri LJ 889), Ahmadi, J.\n(as the Lord Chief Justice then was) speaking for the\nBench summarised the position in the following words :\n(SCC p 559, para 16 : (at Pp 894-95, Para 16 of Cri LJ).\n A prosecutrix of a sex offence cannot be\nput on a par with an accomplice. She is in fact a\nvictim of the crime. The Evidence Act nowhere\nsays that her evidence cannot be accepted\nunless it is corroborated in material particulars.\nShe is undoubtedly a competent witness under\nSection 118 and her evidence must receive the\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nsame weight as is attached to an injured in cases\nof physical violence. The same degree of care of\nand caution must attach in the evaluation of her\nevidence as in the case of an injured complainant\nor witness and no more. What is necessary is that\nthe Court must be alive to and conscious of the\nfact that it is dealing with the evidence of a person\nwho is interested in the outcome of the charge\nlevelled by her. If the Court keeps this in mind\nand feels satisfied that it can act on the evidence\nof the prosecutrix, there is no rule of law or\npractice incorporated in the Evidence Act similar\nto Illustration (b) to Section 114 which required it\nto look for corroboration. If for some reason the\nCourt is hesitant to place implicit reliance on the\ntestimony of the prosecutrix it may look for\nevidence which may lend assurance to her\ntestimony short of corroboration required in the\ncase of an accomplice. The nature of evidence\nrequired to lend assurance to the testimony of the\nprosecutrix must necessarily depend on the facts\nand circumstances of each case. But if a\nprosecutrix is an adult and of full understanding\nthe Court is entitled to base a conviction on her\nevidence unless the same is shown to be infirm\nand not trustworthy. If the totality of the\ncircumstances appearing on the record of the\ncase disclose that the prosecutrix does not have\na strong motive to falsely involve the person\ncharged, the Court should ordinarily have no\nhesitation in accepting her evidence. \nWe are in respectful agreement with the above\nexposition of law. In the instant case our careful analysis of\nthe statement of the prosecutrix has created an impression on\nour minds that she is a reliable and truthful witness. Her\ntestimony suffers from no infirmity or blemish whatsoever. We\nhave no hesitation in acting upon her testimony alone without\nlooking for any corroboration. However, in this case there is\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nample corroboration available on the record to lend further\ncredence to the testimony of the prosecutrix.\n. In the light of the above said ratio of the decision of\nthe Apex Court, I find that in the case on hand the testimony of\nthe prosecutrix discussed hereinabove suffers from no\ninfirmity and she is a reliable and truthful witness. There is\nample corroboration available on the record to lend further\ncredence to the testimony of the prosecutrix in the form of the\ndeposition of PW 2 to whom the prosecutrix had narrated the\nincident in the evening on the same day and she disclosed the\noccurrence to her husband immediately after he returned from\nattending the fair. Medical evidence is not of much relevance\nfor the reason that prosecutrix was examined by Dr. Shyam\nafter about 24 days from the alleged day of occurrence and\nfurther because she is a married woman and was habitual of\nsexual inter course. \nIn the present case, the prosecutrix was medico legally\nexamined after four days of the occurrence. \nIn  Karnel Singh v. State of M.P.  1995(3) RCR (Criminal)\n, it was observed as under: \n 7.\n        The submission overlooks the fact\nthat in India women are slow and hesitant to complain of such\nassaults and if the prosecutrix happens to be a married person\nshe will not do anything without informing her husband. Merely\nbecause the complaint was lodged less than promptly does\nnot raise the inference that the complaint was false. The\nreluctance to go to the police is because of society s attitude\ntowards such women; it casts doubt and shame upon her\nrather than comfort and sympathize with her. Therefore, delay\nin lodging complaints in such cases does not necessarily\nindicate that her version is false. \nIn view of the observations of the Hon ble Apex Court, it is\nnecessary to notice the judgments relied by the counsel for the appellant.\nReliance has been placed upon  Tameezuddin @ Tammu v. State of\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\n(NCT) of Delhi  2009(4) RCR (Criminal) 345. A perusal of the said\njudgment reveals that the same is not attracted on the facts of the present\ncase. Their Lordships of Hon ble Apex Court took into consideration the\ntestimony of PW-1 prosecutrix where she told the appellant that everything\nwas forgiven and forgotten. Another judgment relied by the counsel for the\nappellant rendered in  State of Haryana v. Dilawar  2009(3) RCR\n(Criminal) 2001 is also not attracted, as the Court has given credence to\nthe fact that Zile Singh PW-6 in that case had not supported the\nprosecution. Similarly  Kishan v. State of Haryana  2009(3) RCR\n(Criminal) 480, a judgment rendered by a Single Bench of this Court is\nalso not attracted on the facts of the present case, as it was held that the\nevidence of the prosecutrix was neither reliable nor trustworthy. It was\nfurther held that each case depends on its own facts and circumstances.\nAnother judgment cited by counsel for the appellant, rendered by a\nDivision Bench of Hon ble Apex Court in  Pandurang Sitaram Bhagwat v.\nState of Maharashtra  2005(1) RCR (Criminal) 858 also states that each\ncase is to be determined on the factual matrix of that case. \nThis Court has already held that testimony of the prosecutrix\naspires confidence, therefore, in view of the discussion made above and\nthe observations made by the Hon ble Apex Court in the judgments relied,\nthis Court is of the opinion that present appeal is devoid of any merit and\nis thus, liable to be dismissed. \nCounsel for the appellant has relied upon another judgment of\nthis Court rendered in  Balkar Singh v. State of Haryana  2007(4) RCR\n(Criminal) 597 to contend that taking into consideration long pendency of\nthe trial, sentence awarded upon the appellant should be reduced to the\nminimum period prescribed. \nThis Court is of the view that there are no special or adequate\nreasons to reduce the sentence awarded upon the accused appellant. It is\nCriminal Appeal No.691-SB of 1998\nnot a case where the accused and the prosecutrix had eloped together. It\nis also not a case of love affair, where because the age of the prosecutrix\nwas less therefore, the sentence should be reduced. In the present case,\nthe appellant had committed offence of rape to satisfy his lust, therefore,\nthere is no scope for reduction in sentence awarded to the accused\nappellant. Hence, this prayer is also declined. \nDismissed. \n[KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA]\nJUDGE \nFebruary 23, 2010\nrps"
