State of Haryana).\nVide notification dated 7.1.1988 published in Haryana\nGovernment Gazette, issued under section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act,\n( for short `the Act'), Government of Haryana, notified the land in\ndispute measuring 2 kanal 11 marlas situated in village Bijjarpur Tangori ,\nTehsil Thanesar, District Kurukshetra, with intention to acquire the same for\na public purpose,namely, for allotment of residential plots to landless/\nhomeless members of backward classes and economically weaker section of\nthe village. Notification dated 25.4.1988 was published under section 6 of\nthe Act, declaring that the land measuring 2 kanal 11 marlas was acquired\nRFA No.1695 of 1990\nfor the public purpose mentioned above. The landowners were given an\nopportunity to file objections. After hearing the objections Award No.6\ndated 30.6.1988 was pronounced by the Land Acquisition Collector fixing\ncompensation at the rate of Rs.20,000/- per acre for Chahi land, Rs.15000/-\nper acre for Barani land, Rs.12,000/- per acre for Banjar Jadeed, Rs.8000/-\nper acre for Banjar Kadeem land and Rs.6000/- per acre for gair mumkin..\nIt is not in dispute that the land in dispute is Chahi in nature. The\nlandowners/appellants were also awarded solatium at the rate of 30% along\nwith variation charges at the rate of 15% of the compensation amount.\nHowever, no interest was awarded as possession was not taken till the date\nof the award, was announced.\nAggrieved against the aforesaid award of the Collector,\nlandowners filed reference under Section 18 of the Act, contending that the\nmarket value determined by the Land Acquisition Collector was inadequate\nand he has failed to take into consideration the prevailing market value of\nthe land in question. Application was contested by the State of Haryana\nsubmitting that the compensation awarded by the Collector was quite\nadequate and market value was fixed taking taking into consideration\nrelevant factors for the said purpose.\nOn the pleadings of the parties, the following issues were\nframed:-\n. What was the market value of the acquired land at the time\nof issue of notification under section 4(1) of the Land\nAcquisition Act ?OPP\n. Relief.\nAfter considering the evidence on record, vide the impugned\nRFA No.1695 of 1990\naward the Reference Court fixed market value of the land at the rate of\nRs.40,000/- per acre for Chahi land. The claimants were also held entitled\nto all the statutory benefits as per the Amendment Act of 1984. However,\nthe variation charges at the rate of 15% awarded by the Collector were\nordered to be deleted, as the same were not permissible in law.\nStill feeling dissatisfied, the appellant has approached this\nCourt by way of the instant appeal, for further enhancement of the\ncompensation awarded to him.\nI have heard the learned counsel for the parties and perused the\nrecord of the case with their help.\n It is not in dispute that the acquired land was agricultural in\nnature at the time of acquisition. It has also been established on record that\nthe same was near to the village abadi. It may also be relevant to mention\nthat the sale instances produced on record by the State depict that the\naverage sale price of the land was Rs.15233/- and Rs.19254/-. It may also be\nnoticed that there is nothing on file to prove that the lands of these two sale\ninstances was also situated in the same locality. On the other hand sale deed\nEx.P1 dated 2.7.1987 vide which 4 marlas of land was sold for Rs.3000/-\ndenotes the average sale price of Rs.1,20,000/- and it has also come on\nrecord that the land under the said sale instances is similarly situated as the\nacquired land. However, it is well settled that even the sale instances\npertaining to small piece of land can be considered while determining the\nvalue of a big chunk of land after applying a suitable cut. Keeping in view\nthe fact that land was measuring 4 marlas was sold vide sale stance Ex.P1\nand that the total land acquired in question is 2 Kanal 11 marlas, this Court\nfeels that a cut off 25% on the said sale price be applied in the instant case.\nRFA No.1695 of 1990\nThus, after applying the said cut, the rate of the land comes to Rs.90,000/-\nper acre. It may also be noticed that the said sale instance is dated 2.7.1987\nwhereas the acquisition has taken place after about six months i.e. 7.1.1988.\nThus, the appellant is also entitled to a suitable increase in the market value\nof the land keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case. This\nCourt is of the view that the market value of the land in question should\nhave been determined at Rs.100,000/- per acre.\nIn view of the above, RFA No.1695 of 1990 filed by the\nclaimants is allowed and RFA No.1876 of 1990 filed by the State of\nHaryana is dismissed. The market value of the land in question is\ndetermined at the rate of Rs.1,00,000/-per acre. The appellant is also entitled\nto all the statutory benefits as permissible.\n(Rakesh Kumar Garg)\n Judge\nJuly 5, 2011\nrk\nRFA No.1695 of 1990\nIN THE HIGH COURTOF PUNJAB AND HARYANA, CHANDIGARH.\n RFA No.1876 of 1990\n Date of decision: 5.7.2011\nState of Haryana\n...Appellant\n vs\nJeeva Singh\n\n....Respondent\nCORAM:\nHON'BLE MR.JUSTICE RAKESH KUMAR GARG.\n---\nPresent:\nMr.Ashish Gupta, AAG Haryana, for the State.\nNone for the respondent.\n--\n Rakesh Kumar Garg,J.(oral).\nFor orders, see RFA No. 1695 of 1990.\n(Rakesh Kumar Garg)\n Judge\nJuly 5, 2011\nrk"
