  "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA \nAT CHANDIGARH \n\nC.W.P. No. 11344 of 1994 (O/M).\n\nDate of Decision : April 16, 2009.\nHaryana Seeds Development Corporation Limited, \nChandigarh. \n....... Petitioner.\nVersus.\nThe Presiding Officer, Indsutrial Tribunal-cum-\nLabour Court, Gurgaon, and another.\n....... Respondents. \nCORAM:\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH.\nPresent:-\nMr. Vishal Gupta, Advocate,\nfor the petitioner. \n\nMr. Surender Lamba, Advocate,\nfor the respondent No. 2.\n\nAUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH, J. (ORAL). \nC.M. No. 3517 of 2009.\nCounsel for the parties state that the main writ petition may be\nheard and decided. \nWith the consent of counsel for the parties, the main case is\ntaken up for final disposal.\nC.W.P. No. 11344 of 1994. \n\nAn award dated 25.04.1994 (Annexure-P-16), came to be passed\nin favour of the respondent No. 2-workman, holding him entitled to\nreinstatement in service with continuity of service and full back wages. The\nsaid award was challenged by the petitioner-management before this Court\nthrough the present writ petition but as no stay was granted, the respondent\nC.W.P. No. 11344 of 1994.\nNo. 2-workman was taken back in service, vide order dated 24.09.1994. The\nworkman continued with his service and during the pendency of the writ\npetition, vide order dated 19.05.2004, the services of the respondent No. 2-\nworkman have been regularised w.e.f. 01.10.2003, as per the Government\npolicy. \nIn this view of the matter, the question with regard to\nreinstatement in service of the respondent No.2-workman have been\nrendered infructuous. However, counsel for the petitioner-management\ncontends that full back wages should have been granted to the respondent\nNo.2-workman from the date of his retrenchment as the same was held not in\nconsonance with the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act. \nOn the other hand, counsel for the respondent No. 2-workman\nsubmits that since the provisions as contained in Section 25-N of the\nIndustrial Disputes Act have not been complied with, therefore, the\nrespondent No.2-workman is held entitled to reinstatement in service and\nhas been rightly granted by the Labour Court. \nI have heard counsel for the parties and have gone through the\nrecords of the case. It is a matter of fact which is admitted that the\nrespondent No. 2-workman was retrenched from service. The provisions as\ncontained in Section 25-F of the Industrial Disputes Act were complied with\nbut since the provisions as contained in Section 25-N of the Industrial\nDisputes Act were applicable to the petitioner, the same having not been\ncomplied with, the retrenchment of the respondent No. 2-workman was not\nin consonance with the Industrial Disputes Act. In these peculiar facts and\ncircumstances of the case, it would be just and equitable that full back wages\nwhich have been granted to the respondent No. 2-workman by the Labour\n-2-\nC.W.P. No. 11344 of 1994.\nCourt, vide its impugned award dated 25.04.1994 (Annexure-P-16), be\nmodified to read as 50% back wages from the date of his retrenchment till\nthe date of his reinstatement. It would not be out of way to mention here\nthat since the services of the respondent No. 2-workman have been\nregularised, the question of reinstatement of respondent No. 2-workman is\nno more in question which would require adjudication by this Court. It is\nmade clear that due to the passing of present order, the services of the\nrespondent No. 2-workman will not be affected in any way.\nThe writ petition stands disposed of in above terms. \n\n(AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH)\n JUDGE\nApril 16, 2009. \nsjks. \n\nWhether referred to the Reporter   Yes/No.\n-3-"
