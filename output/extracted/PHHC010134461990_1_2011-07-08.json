To be referred to the Reporters or not?\n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?\n****\nPresent:\nMr. Ravi Dutt Sharma, DAG Haryana for the petitioner \nMr. JS Mannipur, Advocate for respondents\n****\nSURYA KANT, J. (ORAL)\n(1).\nThis Civil Writ Petition is directed by the State of Haryana\nagainst the award dated 04.01.1990 (Annexure P9) passed\nby the Labour Court, Ambala City directing re-instatement\nof respondent No.1 with full backwages and continuity of\nservice. \n(2).\nThe first respondent was appointed as Electrician on work-\ncharged basis at Hathnikund Barrage, Mech.Divn.No.1,\nYamuna Nagar w.e.f. 14.11.1979. While the case of\nrespondent No.1 was that his services were illegally\nterminated on 24.06.1981. \n(3).\nOn the other hand, the plea taken by the petitioner-\nDepartment was that he had abandoned the employment. \nCWP No.3408 of 1990.doc\n- 2  \n(4).\nThe Labour Court on appreciation of the evidence on\nrecord, came to the conclusion that it was not a case of\nabandonment of employment rather the first respondent\nwas retrenched from service without complying with the\nprovisions of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Consequential\nrelief of re-instatement with backwages and continuity of\nservice was granted.\n(5).\nIt is the conceded position that in the absence of any ad\ninterim stay order, the petitioner-Department reinstated\nrespondent No.1 in service and even the backwages were\nalso paid on his furnishing security to the satisfaction of\nthe Labour Court as was directed vide order September,\n, 1991.\n(6).\nDuring the interregnum, the service of respondent No.1\nhas been regularized and is nearing the age of\nsuperannuation. \n(7).\nIn these circumstances, I do not deem it appropriate to go\ninto the merits of the impugned Award and dismiss the\nwrit petition as infructuous, however, with a clarification\nthat the impugned Award shall not be taken as binding\nprecedent in the other cases.\n(8).\nOrdered accordingly.
