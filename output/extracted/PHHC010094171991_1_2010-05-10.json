Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgement?\n. To be referred to the Reporters or not?\n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?\n\nPRESENT:\n Mr. Subhash Ahuja, Advocate,\n for the petitioner.\nMr. S. S. Pattar, Sr.DAG, Haryana,\nfor the State.\nNone for respondent Nos.3 to 8.\n****\nRANJIT SINGH, J. (ORAL)\nMr.Ahuja, learned counsel appearing for the petitioner is\napparently flogging a dead horse. The claim of the petitioner, who is\nno more, is not only pressed hard despite knowing that even two\nrespondents, against whom, he was claiming seniority, are also died.\nThe seniority claim of the late petitioner, which is being\npursued by his L.Rs, is made out the ground of his appointment in\nthe regular service. It appears that the petitioner as well as the\nrespondents were initially appointed as Computor in the pay scale of\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.14364 OF 1991 :{ 2 }:\nRs.110-225 in the Directorate of Land Records, Haryana. He joined\nthe duties on 18.9.1978. Subsequently, however, he was absorbed in\nthe respondent-office w.e.f 1.3.1979. Though the petitioner would\nmake reference to various Government notifications but the fact\nremains that he was regularised w.e.f 15.9.1982. Like him, the\nprivate respondents, except respondent No.6, were also regularised\nwith effect from 15.9.1982. The services of respondent No.6 were\nregularised on 1.4.1985. The grievance of the petitioner is that the\ndate of regularisation of the private respondents was subsequently\nchanged to 1.1.1980. \nThe counsel would contend that the petitioner was senior\nto the private respondents and on the basis of his seniority as\ndetermined in the seniority list issued, he was granted the selection\ngrade, which was allowed to 15% of the posts, in order of seniority.\nIn view of the subsequent change of date of regularisation of the\nprivate respondents to 1.1.1980, the petitioner became junior to the\nprivate respondents and accordingly the selection grade, which was\nallowed to him, was withdrawn. Accordingly, the payment which was\nmade to him, was also withdrawn. \nThe record would show that when the petitioner was\nshown senior to the private respondents, they had filed a civil suit,\nwhich was allowed. The petitioner not only filed an appeal against the\njudgment passed by the Civil Court but also filed present writ petition,\nwhich he claims to have filed prior to coming to know of the filing of\nCivil Court. Apparently, the petitioner has pursued two remedies. His\nappeal filed against the judgement rendered by the Trial Court was\nallowed only on the ground that he had challenged the seniority in\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.14364 OF 1991 :{ 3 }:\nthe writ petition. \nMr. Som Nath Saini, though is not representing the\nprivate respondents in the writ petition but is appearing for the\nappellant in connected S.A.O. No.22 of 1996, which is being\ndisposed of alongwith the present writ petition. On the basis of\nrecord of S.A.O as well as other Civil Writ Petition Nos.8002 of 1999\nand 21603 of 2008, Mr.Saini would point out that by no stretch of\nimagination, the petitioner would rank senior to the private\nrespondents. He would point out that the petitioner was appointed\nwith effect from 18.9.1978, whereas the private respondents were\nappointed as Computor on 1.12.1977. The petitioner was absorbed\nin the respondent-Department with effect from 1.3.1979 whereas the\nprivate respondents were so absorbed with effect from 1.1.1979. It is\nin view of this seniority that the private respondents were regularised\nwith effect from 1.1.1980 whereas the petitioner being junior to them\nwas so regularised with effect from 15.1.1982. Because of the\nseniority, the private respondents had prior right for regularisation on\ncompletion of two years of service and, thus, the policy dated\n.1.1980 was applicable for their regularisation. \nThe petitioner has no basis to make a claim of seniority\neither on the basis of date of appointment or on the date of\nregularisation or even on the basis of date of his absorption. Taking\nthe case from any angle, the private respondents always remained\nsenior to him and were so regularised on 1.1.1980. Otherwise also,\nthere is no issue left to be decided in this case in view of the death of\nthe petitioner as well as two of the respondents. The selection grade\nwas required to be granted on the basis of seniority to the 15% of the\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.14364 OF 1991 :{ 4 }:\nposts and accordingly this was rightly withdrawn from the petitioner. \nThere is, thus, no merit in the writ petition. The same is\naccordingly dismissed. However, since the petitioner was granted\nthis selection grade and he had not made any misrepresentation, the\nrecovery can not be effected from the L.Rs of the petitioner. \nThe consequence of this order would be that S.A.O No.22\nof 1996 filed by Charan Singh would have to be allowed and the\njudgment passed by the first Appellate Court shall stand reversed\nand the Trial Court order restored. It is so ordered.\nMay 10, 2010 \n\n( RANJIT SINGH )\nkhurmi\n\n JUDGE"
