JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA\nPresent: \nMr. Saurav Mohunta, Advocate for petitioner. \nMr. T. S. Sangha, Senior Advocate with\nMr. Narinder Singh, Advocate for accused. \nMr. Manmohan Sikka, Assistant Advocate General Haryana for the\nState\nKANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. (Oral)\nIn the present case, Special Judge Sirsa in a most cryptic\nmanner, without any application of mind, has discharged the accused only\non the ground that in application submitted by DSP, it has been stated that\nonly charge under Section 323 IPC is made out. It was incumbent upon\nthe Court to apply its own mind and arrive at its own conclusion. The\nreport of DSP cannot be accepted as a final word. The Special Judge\nSirsa could not make out the difference that application was for discharge\nfrom custody and not discharge from case. Furthermore, no notice was\nissued to complainant before accepting the request in writing made by the\nDSP. \nThe mandate laid in Bhagwant Singh v. Commissioner of\nPolice & Anr. (SC) 1985 (2) CLR Vol.XVIII (353) has not been complied\nCriminal Revision No.893 of 1996\nwith by the Special Judge. On this score alone, the order is liable to be set\naside. Hence, impugned order is set aside. \nParties will cause their appearance in the Court of learned\ntrial Court on 24th April, 2008. The learned Special Judge Sirsa will\nformulate its own opinion, whether the request of the prosecution has to\nbe accepted or not or challan is to be awaited. Needless to say that before\npassing any order, complainant and counsel for the accused will be heard.\nAnything said herein shall not be considered expression of opinion on the\nmerits of the case. \n[Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia]\nJudge\nFebruary 22, 2008.\nrps"
