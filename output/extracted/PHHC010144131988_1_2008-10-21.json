No.9620 of 1988\n Date of Decision:21.10.2008\nThe Pepsu Road Transport Corporation, Patiala\n.....Petitioner\nVs.\nThe Presiding Officer, Labour Court, Bhatinda and another\n.....Respondents\nCORAM:- HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE HARBANS LAL\nPresent:-\nMr. Varinder Pal Singh, Advocate for the petitioner.\n****\nHARBANS LAL, J.\nThis petition has been moved by the Pepsu Road Transport\nCorporation, Patiala under Articles 226/227 of the Constitution of India for\nquashing the order dated 24.3.1988 Annexure P.1.\nThe brief facts giving rise to this petition are that Bagga Singh-\nrespondent was placed under suspension on 11.5.1981 for committing\nmisconduct. He was charge-sheeted and a departmental inquiry was held.\nFinally vide order dated 1.7.1985, he was awarded the punishment of\nstoppage of increment with cumulative effect with a further rider that he\nwill not be paid anything over and above the subsistence allowance already\ndrawn by him and the period of his suspension shall not be treated as period\non duty. He filed an application under Section 33-C(2) of Industrial\nDisputes Act, 1947 (for short, `the Act') claiming the arrears of salary for\nthe suspension period as well as arrears of increment from 7.6.1981 to\n.6.1987 which was opposed. Vide impugned order dated 24.3.1988\nAnnexure P.1, the same was allowed by the Presiding Officer, Labour\nCourt, Bhatinda. \nC.W.P. No.9620 of 1988\n-2-\nNone has come forward to argue on behalf of the respondent-\nBagga Singh.\nI have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner, besides\nperusing the findings returned by the learned Presiding Officer, Labour\nCourt with due care and circumspection.\nMr. Varinder Pal Singh, Advocate appearing on behalf of the\npetitioner argued that the workman's right to the relief claimed could not be\ndetermined by the Labour Court under Section 33-C(2) of the Act. He\nfurther puts that the right of Bagga Singh- respondent to receive the arrears\nof salary and treating his suspension period as on duty with effect from\n.11.1981 was neither existing nor settled and that being so, the\njurisdiction of the Labour Court was barred to hear the application.\nI have well considered these submissions. Of course, as ruled\nin re: M.D., Oswal Hosiery (Regd.) v. D.D. Gupta, 1994 LLR 487 (Del.),\n once there is an admission of the existing right of the workman by the\nemployer in regard to the benefit which the former is entitled to and receive\nfrom the later, section 33-C(2) of the Act would come into play.  Here in\nthis case, it is to be determined as to whether there was any such admission\non the part of the Corporation. The learned Presiding Officer, Labour\nCourt, Bhatinda has observed in the impugned award as under:-\n ii)\nThe workman was placed under suspension on\n.5.1981. His suspension till 10-11-1981 is lawful\naccording to Regulation No.24 ibid w.e.f. 11.11.1981,\nthe workman was entitled to full wages because he could\nnot be kept under suspension beyond a period of six\nmonths. He is thus entitled to wages over and above the\nC.W.P. No.9620 of 1988\n-3-\nsubsistence allowance from 11.1.1981 to 4.3.1985. Such\narrears of wages have been claimed at the rate of\nRs.135/- P.M. The management has not challenged the\nrate at which the workman has claimed the arrears. The\namount of arrears under this head from 11.11.1981 to\n.3.1985 work out to Rs.6570/-.\niii)\nUnder Regulation No.13(5) of the Regulations, the\nperiod of suspension is not to count towards increments.\nThe increment of Rs.15/- which had otherwise fallen\ndue on 7.6.1981 thus was deferred by a period of six\nmonths i.e., the period of legal suspension. The\nincrement thus fell due on 7.12.1981. Arrears of\nincremental arrears from 7.12.81 to 5.6.1982 @ Rs.15/-\nP.M. work out to Rs.90/-.\n(iv)\nThe next annual increments of Rs.20/- P.M. each fell due\nrespectively on 7.6.1982, 7.6.1983, 7.6.1984 and 7.6.85\nand 7.6.86 and the workman was entitled to receive from\nthe employer arrears @ Rs.35/- (15+20) i.e., Rs.420/- till\n.6.83 @ Rs.55/- (35+20) i.e. 660/- till 6.6.84, Rs.75/-\n(55+20) i.e., Rs.900/- till 6.6.85, Rs.95/- (Rs.75+20) i.e.,\n/- till 6.6.1986 and @ Rs.115/- (95+20) i.e.,\nRs.1380 till 6.6.87, in all Rs.4300/-. I thus hold that a\ntotal sum of Rs.10,960/- is due by the Respondent to the\nworkman. \nIt is quite plain and patent from the above observations that the\nmanagement has not challenged the rate at which the workman has claimed\nC.W.P. No.9620 of 1988\n-4-\nthe arrears. So, ostensibly, it tantamounts to admission of the existing right\nof the workman   respondent. Sequelly, I do not consider it proper to\ninterfere with the impugned award in the exercise of writ jurisdiction under\nArticles 226/227 of the Constitution of India. Hence, this petition is\ndismissed.\nOctober 21, 2008\n ( HARBANS LAL )\nrenu\nJUDGE\nWhether to be referred to the Reporter? Yes/No"
