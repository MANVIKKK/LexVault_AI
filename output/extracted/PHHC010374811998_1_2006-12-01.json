    "is stated to be an HCS Officer whereas the wife is also stated to be employed in some private concern and may be earning some money. For the incident of 3.2.1990, an FIR No.308 dated 9.12.1990 under Section 498-A IPC had been registered at P.S City Bahadurgarh at the instance of father of the respondent-wife. Annexure P-3 shows that all the witnesses including respondent-wife had turned hostile in that case and did not support their allegations and then accused, who happened to be present appellant i.e husband Hardeep, his father, mother and sister had been acquitted on 16.8.1994. Even in spite of that, things did not improve and present petition for divorce had been filed in July 1995. Now more than 17 years have passed when the marriage took place. There had been litigation in the form of earlier petition under Section of the Hindu Marriage Act, 125 Cr.P.C, a criminal case for offence under Section 498-A IPC and second petition for divorce filed in 1995. Hon'ble Supreme Court in para 62 of the judgment reported in Naveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 had observed as under: Even at this stage, the respondent does not want divorce by mutual consent. From the analysis and evaluation of FAO.No.81-M of 1998 #5# the entire evidence, it is clear that the respondent has resolved to live in agony only to make life a miserable hell for the appellant as well. This type of adamant and callous attitude, in the context of the facts of this case, leaves no manner of doubt in our mind that the respondent is bent upon treating the appellant with mental cruelty. It is abundantly clear that the marriage between the parties had broken down irretrievably and there is no chance of their coming together, or living together again. When the case for the offence under Section 498-A IPC was registered and the husband, his sister and parents-in-law were arrested and thereafter during trial the witnesses turn hostile and husband and other relatives are acquitted, then it is itself a cruelty practised. This is further born out from the fact that father of the respondent-wife had written complaints copy Annexure P-1 so that husband does not get posting as ACP and then posting of the husband to the HCS was delayed at the instance of respondent or her father and husband could get appointment only through the intervention of the Court. In the case before Hon'ble Supreme Court, parties had been living separately for more than 10 years whereas in this case, they had been living separately for more than 16 years and there had been criminal and civil proceedings between the parties. The marriage has subsisted only in name. It has wrecked beyond the hope of salvage. Respondent still does not want divorce by mutual consent. Preservation of marriage is totally unworkable and is source of misery for the parties. Marriage has definitely FAO.No.81-M of 1998 #6# been irretrievably broken down. Under these circumstances, petition for divorce is allowed. It is directed that the marriage between the parties shall stand dissolved subject to the condition that the husband-appellant, who is an officer of Haryana Civil Services pays/deposits Rs.10,00,000/- as permanent alimony. Let Rs.5,00,000/- be paid within a period of three months and another Rs.5,00,000/- within six months. Failing to pay or deposit this permanent alimony as directed, this appeal and the petition for divorce shall stand dismissed. The amount as ordered be deposited in this Court.

  "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT FOR THE STATES OF PUNJAB AND\nHARYANA AT CHANDIGARH\nFAO.No.81-M of 1998\nDATE OF ORDER: 1.12.2006\nHardeep\n...Petitioner(s)\nVersus\nSunita\n....Respondent(s)\nCORUM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE M.M. AGGARWAL\n.*.*.*.\nPresent:\nDr. Surya Parkash, Advocate.\nMr. Arun Jain, Advocate.\nM.M. AGGARWAL,J\nThis is an appeal against judgment dated 24.4.1998 passed by\nAdditional District Judge, Hisar whereby petition under Section 13 of the\nHindu Marriage Act for dissolution of marriage filed by the present\nappellant i.e husband Hardeep against his wife Sunita respondent was\ndismissed.\nThe marriage in this case had taken place on 10.5.1989 at\nBahadurgarh. The parties had lived as husband and wife at Hansi but no\nchild was born out of the wedlock. At the time of marriage, appellant is\nstated to be a Probationary Officer in Bank but he was preparing and \nFAO.No.81-M of 1998\n#2#\nappearing for Central Services Examination. \nAccording to the appellant, respondent wife did not cooperate\nwith him and started torturing him. She was suffering from inferiority\ncomplex and never wanted appellant to get high position in life. Then on\n.2.1990, when she was at matrimonial home at Hansi, she started\nquarrelling with him and other family members without any rhyme and\nreason and created a scene by coming out of the house into street and then\nwhen he along with his family members as also one Ram Kumar was\npresent in the house, she deliberately poured kerosene oil upon herself and\nput her ablaze with the calculated mind of establishing that she could use\ncoercive methods. Then he (husband appellant) had doused her flames.\nThat respondent-wife was in fact guilty of attempting to commit suicide but\nshe falsely got registered the case for the offence under Section 498-A IPC\nin which appellant, his aged parents of the appellant and sister-in-law were\narrested and remained in jail for several days. \nFurther petitioner-husband was selected in the Central Services\nto be posted as ACP but respondent-wife created problems. Later on,\nappellant was selected for HCS post and again respondent created problems\nagainst his appointment and the appellant could get the appointment only\nafter filing writ in this Court. Earlier a petition for divorce had been filed\nby the husband in the year 1990, which was dismissed on merits on\n.10.1992 copy Annexure R-11 and appeal had been filed in this Court\nagainst that judgment but that was dismissed as husband did not pay the\nmaintenance. \nIn the earlier petition, ground of cruelty had been taken but\nsince there was FIR of the occurrence dated 3.2.1990 and that matter was \nFAO.No.81-M of 1998\n#3#\npending trial, grounds of cruelty of incident of 3.2.1990 were not taken into\nconsideration and discussed. In the present petition, there was an issue\nwhether the petition was barred by principle of resjudicata. Additional\nDistrict Judge had held that all the instances of cruelty except incident of\n.2.1990 were barred by principle of resjudicata and only incident of\n.2.1990 was considered and it had been held that the appellant was not\nentitled to decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty.\nCounsel for the appellant-husband had argued that the marriage\ntook place in the year 1989. Parties had lived together only for short time\nand they are living separately since 1990 and it is a broken marriage. It was\nargued that false FIR was got registered of the incident of 3.2.1990.\nAppellant-husband, his father, mother and his sister were arrested and the\nappellant-husband could not get service as ACP and then as HCS Officer\nand he could get the service only after a writ petition was filed in this Court\nand order dated 22.7.1993 (copy Annexure P-2) was made. It was argued\nthat in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court reported in\nNaveen Kohli v. Neelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 , it is a fit case,\nwhere marriage should be dissolved by decree of divorce.\nOn behalf of the respondent-wife, it was argued that from the\nvery beginning, petitioner-husband had made up his mind not to keep the\nwife. He had even written letter copy Annexure R-13 just after three\nmonths of the marriage. It was argued that the appellant cannot be\npermitted to take advantage of his own wrong.\nHowever, perusal of language of R-13 shows that petitioner\nwanted his wife to rise in life. From the record, it would come out that\nearlier petition for divorce had been filed in the year 1990 by the husband, \nFAO.No.81-M of 1998\n#4#\nwhich was dismissed. There were proceedings under Section 125 Cr.P.C,\nwhich was got dismissed as withdrawn by the wife (copy Annexure P-4) on\n.11.1993. The present petition for divorce had been filed on 31.7.1995 and\nwas decided on 24.4.1998, more than eight years back. \nBefore hearing the arguments in this appeal, parties had been\ncalled to come present. They had appeared but then again it was found that\nno settlement between the parties in the form of mutual divorce or living\ntogether was possible. Husband is stated to be an HCS Officer whereas the\nwife is also stated to be employed in some private concern and may be\nearning some money.\nFor the incident of 3.2.1990, an FIR No.308 dated 9.12.1990\nunder Section 498-A IPC had been registered at P.S City Bahadurgarh at the\ninstance of father of the respondent-wife. Annexure P-3 shows that all the\nwitnesses including respondent-wife had turned hostile in that case and did\nnot support their allegations and then accused, who happened to be present\nappellant i.e husband Hardeep, his father, mother and sister had been\nacquitted on 16.8.1994. Even in spite of that, things did not improve and\npresent petition for divorce had been filed in July 1995.\nNow more than 17 years have passed when the marriage took\nplace. There had been litigation in the form of earlier petition under Section\nof the Hindu Marriage Act, 125 Cr.P.C, a criminal case for offence under\nSection 498-A IPC and second petition for divorce filed in 1995. Hon'ble\nSupreme Court in para 62 of the judgment reported in Naveen Kohli v.\nNeelu Kohli 2006(2) RCR (Civil) 290 had observed as under:\n Even at this stage, the respondent does not want divorce\nby mutual consent. From the analysis and evaluation of \nFAO.No.81-M of 1998\n#5#\nthe entire evidence, it is clear that the respondent has\nresolved to live in agony only to make life a miserable\nhell for the appellant as well.
