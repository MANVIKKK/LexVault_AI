  "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT\nCHANDIGARH\n\n FAO No.1513 of 1992\n Date of decision:30.06.2010\nBharat Rattan Sharma\n ....Appellant\nversus\nGita Malik and others\n...Respondents\nCORAM: HON BLE MR. JUSTICE K. KANNAN\n----\nPresent:\nMs. Radhika Suri, Advocate, for the appellant.\nMr. Arvind Bansal, Advocate, for Mr. Rakesh Nagpal, \nAdvocate, for the respondents.\n----\n.\nWhether reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the \njudgment ? \n.\nTo be referred to the reporters or not ? \n.\nWhether the judgment should be reported in the digest ? \n\n ----\nK.Kannan, J. (Oral)\n.\nThe appeal has been filed jointly by the owner of the\nInsurance Company and I notice that there is no permission sought or\ngranted under Section 170 of the Motor Vehicles Act. The Insurance\nCompany cannot, therefore, sustain the appeal jointly with the insured.\nIn the light of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Chinnama\nGeorge and others Versus N.K.Raju and another-(2000) 4 SCC 130,\nthe Insurance Company is transposed as respondent and the Registry\nshall carry out the transposition and array the Insurance Company as 4th\nrespondent. \nFAO No.1513 of 1992\n- 2 -\n.\nIf the case must be treated as an appeal by the insured only,\nthe issue has to be considered with reference to the evidence available as\nregards the salary of the deceased. The deceased was a Veterinary\nSurgeon at Government Piggery Farm, Ambala and the salary certificate\nhas been filed showing that he was drawing Rs.3,895/-. It was elicited in\nevidence that he had put in 7 years of service and the Tribunal had taken\nthe monthly contribution to be Rs.2,600/-. The Court had applied a\nmultiplier of 20 following the judgment of this Court in Joginder Kaur\nVersus State of Haryana through Secretary Transport-1991 ACJ 374.\nThe application of the multiplier in the light of the judgment of the\nHon'ble Supreme Court in Sarla Verma and others Versus Delhi\nTransport Corporation and another-2009 ACJ 1298, would have been\nto provide for a multiplier of 17. In this case, it is seen that the deceased\nwas a government servant and the Tribunal has not taken note of the\nfuture prospects of increase in salary. The Court is empowered to take\njudicial notice of the fact that in government service there are periodical\nincrements through Pay Commission recommendations and the failure of\nthe Tribunal to provide for future increments in salary with promotional\nprospects would, therefore, require to be remedied by taking the future\nincreases at 150% of the salary that he was drawing and if average were\nto be taken after making provision for such an increase, the monthly\nincome should be taken as Rs.6,000/-. If even 17 multiplier were to be\napplied to the amount and provide for all other statutory allowances, the\namount that would require to be paid would not fall short of\nRs.6,30,000/-, which was the amount awarded by the Tribunal and, under\nFAO No.1513 of 1992\n- 3 -\nthe circumstances, I do not find that there is no scope for modification of\nthe award. If, at all there, is only a scope for an increase. However, there\nis no representation on behalf of the respondents, I do not propose to\nundertake such an exercise. The award of the Tribunal is confirmed in\nall respects and the appeal is dismissed. \n (K.KANNAN)\nJUDGE\n.06.2010\nsanjeev"
