Kaushik,\nAdvocate, for the petitioner.\nMr. Rajinder Goyal, Advocate, for respondent No. 2.\nJASBIR SINGH, J. (oral)\nJUDGMENT\nThis writ petition has been filed with a prayer to modify award\ndated August 10, 1987, vide which compensation, for the acquired land, was\ngranted to the petitioner at the rate of Rs. 8/- per square yard.\nHeard counsel for the parties. It is apparent from the record\nthat about 19 Kanals of land of the petitioner was sought to be acquired by\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 8639 OF 1989\n-2-\nissuing a Notification under Section 36 of the Punjab Town Improvement\nAct, 1922 (in short 1922 Act) on September 16, 1969. Notification under\nSection 42 (2) of the 1922 Act was issued on March 7, 1972. The Land\nAcquisition Collector, Bhiwani, vide Award dated January 19, 1973, fixed\nmarket price of the land in question at Rs. 1.25 per square yard excluding\ncompensation for the structures. The petitioner was not satisfied. He\nmoved an application under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894\nfor enhancement of compensation, which was allowed by the Tribunal\nconstituted under the 1922 Act vide order dated August 10, 1987 and\ncompensation amount was enhanced to Rs. 8/- per square yard. Even then\nthe petitioner was not satisfied. He came to this Court by filing this writ\npetition.\nIt is primary contention of counsel for the petitioner that the\nTribunal has not taken note of the potential value of the land under\nacquisition for its development towards commercial and residential use and\nfurther that the evidence produced was not appreciated properly especially\njudgment passed by this Court ( Ex.P-21) on November 25, 1981, awarding\ncompensation for the adjoining land at the rate of Rs. 14/- per square yard.\nMadan Singh, Clerk, Improvement Trust (PW2) deposed that land is\nsituated on Bhiwani Circular Road, next to the Adarsh College and opposite\nto the Bus Stand. It was also so reiterated by Ghansham Dass (PW3) who\nhad been working in the Municipal Committee, Bhiwani. He has\nspecifically stated that the land falls within the Municipal limits and is\nsituated next to the General Bus Stand. To know the situation of land,\nwhich was subject matter of judgment dated November 25, 1989 (Ex. P-21),\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 8639 OF 1989\n-3-\nwe passed the following order on August 31, 2010:\n At the time of arguments, to enhance compensation, reliance\nhas been placed upon a judgment of this Court, copy of which\nis Ex. P-21.\nIt is contention of the counsel for the petitioner that the land,\nwhich was subject matter of judgment Ex. P-21, is situated in\nthe near vicinity of the land, which was subject matter of\nacquisition in this writ petition.\nTo settle the equities, we deem it proper to direct the\nImprovement Trust to put on record site plan showing the\nsituation at the spot of the land, which is subject matter of this\nacquisition and also situation of the land, which was subject\nmatter of acquisition in judgments Ex. P-21 and Ex. P-7, which\nare found mentioned in paragraph No. 25 of the impugned\nAward. \nSite plan has been produced in Court today, which clearly\nindicates that the land in dispute, in this case, is situated on the main road\nand adjoins the land which was subject matter of judgment Ex. P-21 , which\nis situated at its back side. The potential of the land in dispute, as per\nsituation at the spot, is much more as compared to the land, which was\nacquired by issuing a notification under Section 36 of the 1922 Act on\nMarch 12, 1973. It appears that the Tribunal has not relied upon that\ninstance, to grant compensation because the land was acquired after about 3\n  years from the date when land in dispute was acquired. Vide the\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 8639 OF 1989\n-4-\njudgment, mentioned above, the compensation of that land was enhanced to\nRs. 14/- per square yard. Taking note of the situation of the land in this case\nand its proximity to the Bus Stand, and a College and also a fact that it is\nsituated within the Municipal limits, we are of the view that the\ncompensation awarded is on the lower side. We propose to take note of the\ncompensation awarded vide judgment (Ex. P-21) dated November\n\n,\n. In the said case, land was acquired 3   years after the land in dispute\nwas acquired. In view of that, we decide to deduct Rs. 4/- towards\nescalation in prices in the meantime and grant Rs. 10/- per square yard\ntowards compensation in this case. The amount granted towards other\nstatutory benefits by the Tribunal is maintained.\nWith above said modification, this writ petition stands disposed\nof. Respondent- Improvement Trust is directed to make payment of the\ncompensation amount within a period of two months.\n\n( JASBIR SINGH )\nJUDGE\n(AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH)\nJUDGE\nDecember 16 , 2010. \nDKC"
