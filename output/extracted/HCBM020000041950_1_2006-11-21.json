At present an amount of Rs.16,759.24 is\nlying to the credit of the estate as against the proved liability of\nRs.7,33,070/-. Since no further recoveries are possible and since\nno other proved creditor has come forward before the Official\nAssignee, the Official Assignee has prayed that the balance of\nRs.16,759.24 may be transferred to the unclaimed dividend capital\naccount under Rule 178 of the Bombay Insolvency Rules, 1910\nand thereafter to the unclaimed dividend capital revenue account\nand the account may be closed for the administrative purposes.\nHaving regard to the circumstances set out in the report of the\nOfficial Assignee, there is no reason why the prayer should not be\ngranted. Prayer clause (a) of the report of the Official Assignee is\naccordingly granted."
