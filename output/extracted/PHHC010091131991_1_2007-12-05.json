  "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB & HARYANA AT\nCHANDIGARH.\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.1436 OF 1991\nDECIDED ON : 05.12.2007\nRam Kishan Gupta son of Shri Kanshi Ram, caste Mahajan,\nresident of Charkhi Dadri.\n.....Petitioner.\nVersus\nHem Chand son of Shri Amra Ram, caste arora, resident of Main\nMarket, Charkhi Dadri.\n....Respondent.\nCORAM:\nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SHAM SUNDER.\nPresent:\nSh.O.P.Goyal Sr.Adv., with \nMs.Pawanpreet Kaur Adv.\nFor the petitioner.\nNone for the respondent.\nJUDGMENT:\nThis revision petition is directed against the judgment\ndated 28.01.1991 rendered by the Appellate Authority (Additional\nDistt. Judge), Bhiwani vide which it dismissed the appeal against the\norder dated 29.09.1989 of the Rent Controller, Charkhi Dadri, fixing\nthe fair rent of the demised premises @ Rs.86/- including house tax\nw.e.f. 06.01.1988. \n.\nThe landlord/petitioner inducted the respondent, as a\ntenant in the demised premises as fully detailed, in the ejectment\napplication, at a monthly rental of Rs.78/- + house tax. The\nejectment of the respondent/tenant, was sought, on the ground, that\nhe had been in arrears of rent from. 01.11.1987 to 31.12.1987 +\nhouse tax, amounting to Rs.108/-. Prayer for fixation of fair rent,\nwas also made, on the ground that after 01.09.1982 when the fair\nrent, was earlier fixed, there has been an increase in the price index.\nAccordingly, a combined application under Sections 13 & 4 of\nHaryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973, was CIVIL\nWRIT PETITION NO.1436 OF 1991\n-2-\nfiled by the landlord/petitioner.\n.\nUpon notice, the respondent/tenant, put in\nappearance, and filed written statement, wherein, he admitted the\nrelationship of landlord and tenant. The rate of rent, at Rs.78/- per\nmonth (including house tax), was admitted. It was stated that the\narrears of rent, demanded by the landlord/petitioner, had already\nbeen paid by him. It was further stated that the fair rent of the shop\nin-question, at Rs.78/- per month, had already been fixed and there\nhad been no increase in the price index, and, thus, there was no\nquestion of fixing the fair rent again.\n.\nIn the replication, filed by the landlord/petitioner, he\nreiterated all the averments, contained in the petition and repudiated\nthose contained in the written statement.\n.\nOn the pleadings of the parties, the following issues\nwere struck, by the Rent controller:-\n.\nWhether the respondent is liable to be ejected \nfrom the premises indispute, as alleged? OPA\n.\nWhether there are grounds for the fixation of fair rent, \nif so at what rate ? OPA\n.\nWhether the applicant has no locus-standi to file the \napplication ? OPR\n.\nWhether the application is bad for non-joinder of \nnecessary parties ? OPR\n.\nRelief.\n.\nThe parties led documentary, as well as oral evidence,\nin support of their case. After hearing the Counsel for the parties,\nand on, going through the record of the case, the Rent Controller,\nfixed the fair rent at Rs.86/- (round figure) per month, w.e.f.\n.01.1988 including house tax. Since the Counsel for the\nlandlord/petitioner conceded that the respondent had paid the\narrears of rent, including cost and interest, no finding was recorded\non issue No.1, as the same was rendered redundant.\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.1436 OF 1991\n-3-\n.\nFeeling aggrieved, against the judgment dated\n.09.1989, the landlord preferred an appeal, which was dismissed\nby the Appellate Authority (Additional Distt. Judge), Bhiwani. \n.\nDissatisfied with the judgments of the Courts below,\nthe instant revision petition, was filed by the landlord/petitioner.\n.\nNotice of the petition, \n was given to the\nrespondent/tenant. Initially, Counsel for the respondent/tenant, put\nin appearance but, lateron none appeared on his behalf.\n.\nI have heard the Counsel for the petitioner and have\ngone through the record of the case carefully. \n.\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner contended that\nthe formula for fixing the fair rent, depicted in Section 4(2) of\nHaryana Urban (Control of Rent and Eviction) Act, 1973, was\ninterpreted and approved by a Division Bench of this Court in\nYoginder Mohan Versus Krishan Lal 2000(1) PLR 788. It is to be\ndetermined, as to whether, the Courts below, fixed the fair rent in\naccordance with the formula, referred to above, and in consonance\nwith the principle of law laid down in Yoginder Mohan's case\n(supra). Admittedly, the basic rent, in this case, was Rs.78/- per\nmonth including house tax in the year 1982. The application, out of\nthe decision whereof, the instant revision petition has arisen, was\nfiled on 06.01.1988. The price index of the year 1982 was Rs.285.3\npaise and of the year 1987 i.e. one year preceding the filing of the\napplication was Rs.395.7. Under these circumstances, the\ndifference came to be Rs.110.4 or Rs.110/- (round figure). The\npercentage of difference, between the two figures of price index,\ncame to be Rs.38.69%. The Court could grant increase or decrease\nto the maximum of 25% under Section 4 (3) of the Act which came\nto be 9.67%. On this basis the increase in the fair rent came to be\nRs.7.54 (78/9.67x100). The \nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO.1436 OF 1991\n-4-\nfair rent, therefore, came to be Rs.78+7.54 = Rs.85.54. The round\nfigure of fair rent, therefore, came to be Rs.86/- per month w.e.f.\n.01.1988 including house tax. The calculations were also\ndepicted by the Counsel for the revision petitioner, in a separate\nchart, which are in consonance with the decision rendered by the\nCourts below. The Courts below, in my opinion, rightly calculated\nthe fair rent, in accordance with the formula, referred to above, and\nthe principle of law, laid down, in Yoginder Mohan's case (Supra).\nThe judgments of the Lower Courts, therefore, do not suffer from\nany illegality or infirmity and, therefore, no interference is called for\ntherewith.\n.\nFor the reasons recorded hereinbefore, the revision-\npetition, is dismissed with no order as to costs.\nDecember 05, 2007\n(Sham Sunder)\nmamta m\n Judge"
