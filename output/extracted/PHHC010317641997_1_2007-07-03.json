JUSTICE ADARSH KUMAR GOEL\n HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE AJAI LAMBA\nPresent: Mr. VK Sandhir, Advocate, for the petitioners.\n Mr. Har Simran Singh Sethi, Advocate for Caveators.\nJUDGMENT:\nThis petition challenges order dated 25.5.2007, Annexure P.1\ncancelling order of posting of the petitioners to the Municipal Town\nPlanning Wing as Building Inspectors.\nCase of the petitioners is that in the Building Department of\nMunicipal Corporation, Amritsar, there are only seven Building Inspectors\nagainst twenty vacancies and, therefore, the petitioners were posted against\nthe said vacant posts on 11.4.2007. Respondent Nos. 4 to 9 challenged the\nposting of the petitioners by filing a writ petition in this Court, which was\ndisposed of vide order dated 23.4.2007 by directing that decision be taken\non legal notice of the said respondents. Accordingly, order Annexure P.1\nhas been passed cancelling order of posting of the petitioners in the Town\nPlanning Wing. \nCWP No.9397 of 2007\nA perusal of order Anenxure P.1 shows that the Principal\nSecretary to the Government of Punjab has taken into account service rules\nlaying down the qualification for Inspectors which the petitioners did not\npossess. In the report Annexure P.7 submitted by the Commissioner,\nMunicipal Corporation, to the Government, it has been stated that the\nservices of the petitioners became surplus after abolition of octroi in which\ndepartment, the petitioners were working and there was scarcity of staff in\nthe Town Planning department.\nIn the writ petition, finding recorded in the impugned order\nAnenxure P.1 that the petitioners were not technically qualified under the\nrules, has not been disputed. \nContention raised is that the petitioners were not getting any\nextra monetary benefit by working in the said department and no loss was\ncaused to the private respondents and that the private respondents did not\nfulfil the qualifications.\nThe petitioners cannot claim any vested right to be posted on\nany particular post, particularly in absence of qualification, even if there\nmay be shortage of staff in a particular department. The impugned order\ncancelling posting of the petitioners in the department of Town Planning\ncannot be held to be illegal or in violation of any law.\nNo interference is, thus, called for with the impugned order.\nThe writ petition is dismissed. \n(Adarsh Kumar Goel)\n Judge \nJuly 3, 2007\n (Ajai Lamba)\n'gs'\n Judge"
