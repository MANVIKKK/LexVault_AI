PETITIONER\nVersus\nFinancial Commissioner, Haryana, Chandigarh and others \n..... RESPONDENTS\n\nCORAM :- HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SATISH KUMAR MITTAL \n\nPresent:\nNone for the petitioner.\nMr. D. Khanna, Addl. A.G., Haryana,\nfor respondents No.1 and 2.\nMr. Sudhir Mittal, Advocate,\nfor respondents No.3 to 6.\n\n* * *\nSATISH KUMAR MITTAL , J ( Oral )\nThis petition was filed by the petitioner challenging the order\ndated 5.12.1985 (Annexure P-4), passed by the Financial Commissioner,\nHaryana, whereby the revision petition filed by Nirupma Devi (respondent\nNo.3 herein) daughter of Mahadev (a big land owner), challenging the order\nof sanctioning mutation of ownership qua the land in question, passed by\nthe Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, which was confirmed by the\nCollector, Hisar, was allowed and the matter was remanded to the Assistant\nCollector Ist Grade, Hisar, for deciding the matter afresh, after hearing the\nparties and allowing them to lead evidence.\nCWP No. 4440 of 1986\n-2-\nThe brief facts of the case are that the petitioner was a tenant on\nKanals of land, belonging to Mahadev, a big land-owner. The petitioner\nfiled purchase application under Section 18 of the Punjab Security of Land\nTenures Act, 1953 (hereinafter referred to as `the Act of 1953') for\npurchasing the said land. The Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, vide his\norder dated 5.7.1962, allowed the said application and permitted the\npetitioner to purchase the said land on payment of certain amount, which\nwas to be paid in six equal monthly instalments. The petitioner did not make\nany payment. However, it was alleged by him that he made certain payment\nin that regard to the General Power of Attorney of said Mahadev.\nThereafter, on 24.2.1975, the petitioner moved an application before the\nAssistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, for sanctioning of mutation of\nownership in his favour with regard to the said land, on the basis of the\naforesaid purchase order. The Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, vide\norder dated 11.7.1975 (Annexure P-1) allowed the application and\nsanctioned mutation of the said land in favour of the petitioner. Aggrieved\nagainst the said order, Nirupama Devi (respondent No.3 herein) filed an\nappeal before the Collector, Hisar, on the ground that no instalment with\nregard to payment of the aforesaid amount was paid to the land-owner,\nwhich the petitioner was required to deposit in the Government Treasury.\nThe said appeal filed by respondent No.3 was dismissed by the Collector,\nHisar, vide order dated 7.9.1976 (Annexure P-2). The said order was\nchallenged by respondent No.3 before the Commissioner, Hisar Division,\nCWP No. 4440 of 1986\n-3-\nHisar, who vide his order dated 12.3.1980 (Annexure P-3), after coming to\nthe conclusion that the payment of instalment was not made by the\npetitioner, made reference to the Financial Commissioner, Haryana, with the\nrecommendation to set aside the orders dated 11.7.1975 (Annexure P-1) and\n.9.1976 (Annexure P-2), passed by the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar,\nand the Collector, Hisar, respectively, and to remand the case to the\nAssistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar. Accordingly, the Financial\nCommissioner, Haryana, vide his order dated 5.12.1985 (Annexure P-4)\naccepted the said recommendation and remanded the matter.\nThough learned counsel for the petitioner is not present, but\nwith the assistance of learned counsel for the respondents, I have gone\nthrough the impugned orders. The Commissioner, Hisar Division, Hisar,\nwhile recommending to the Financial Commissioner for setting aside the\norder of sanctioning the mutation, has observed that as per Rule 23 (3) of\nthe Punjab Security of Land Tenures Rules, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as\n`the Rules'), the tenant, in whose favour an order to purchase the land is\npassed, is required to deposit the amount of instalment within 15 days,\neither in a Government treasury or a sub-treasury or to pay it to the\nAssistant Collector Ist Grade. Admittedly, in the instant case, the petitioner\nhas neither deposited any amount in a Government treasury or a sub-\ntreasury nor he has made any payment in the court of Assistant Collector Ist\nGrade. He only alleges that some amount was paid by him to the General\nPower of Attorney of Mahadev, the big land owner, which has been denied\nCWP No. 4440 of 1986\n-4-\nby the big land owner. In his order, the learned Commissioner has observed\nthat the petitioner has not paid the price of the land to the land owner in\nterms of the order dated 5.7.1962. His statement to the effect that he had\nbeen paying instalments to the Munshi of Mahadev, the big land owner,\ncannot be accepted, because he has not produced any receipt issued by him.\nIt has been further held that under Rule 23 (3) of the Rules, the amount of\ninstalment fixed under Section 18 of the Act of 1953 could be deposited in\nthe Treasury within 15 days after the decision of the Assistant Collector. In\nthis regard, the learned Commissioner has relied upon a decision of the\nFinancial Commissioner, in Peman Ram v. Smt. Kheoni and others, 1963\nPLJ 35, wherein it was held that under Rule 23 (3) of the Rules, the tenant is\nrequired to deposit the compensation either in Government Treasury or Sub\nTreasury or to pay to the Assistant Collector Ist Grade having jurisdiction.\nDirect payment to the land owner has not been contemplated by the Rules. It\nhas been further held that a tenant, who disregards the Rules and takes the\nrisk of paying instalments to the land owner without getting a receipt, must\npay for the consequences of his folly. The subsequent payment deposited by\nthe tenant on 11.8.1973 was held to be illegal being time barred. Therefore,\nit was held that the Assistant Collector Ist Grade has committed grave\nillegality while sanctioning mutation of ownership in favour of the\npetitioner. The learned Financial Commissioner accepted the said\nrecommendation made by the learned Commissioner and thereafter, set\naside the orders dated 11.7.1975 (Annexure P-1) and 7.9.1976 (Annexure\nCWP No. 4440 of 1986\n-5-\nP-2), passed by the Assistant Collector Ist Grade, Hisar, and the Collector,\nHisar, respectively, and remanded the case to the Assistant Collector Ist\nGrade, Hisar. I do not find any illegality in the said order and the same does\nnot require any interference by this Court under Article 226 of the\nConstitution of India.\nDismissed.\nNovember 09, 2010\n ( SATISH KUMAR MITTAL )\nndj\n JUDGE\nRefer to Reporter"
