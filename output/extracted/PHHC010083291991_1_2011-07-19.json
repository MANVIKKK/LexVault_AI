Jattana, Addl. AG, Punjab \nfor the State.\n ****\nRANJIT SINGH, J.\n\nThe petitioners have filed this writ petition seeking\na writ of mandamus commanding the respondents to grant them one\npre-mature increment on the ground that they had not participated in\nthe strike observed by Punjab Government employees on 8.2.1978.\nThe petitioners have claimed this relief on the ground that other\nemployees have been granted the same relief. The petitioners plead\nthat they had not participated in the strike but were on leave. \nState counsel has relied upon a Full Bench\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 13640 of 1991\n\ndecision in Saroj Kumari Versus State of Punjab, 1998 (3) RSJ\nto urge that in view of the observations made in this case, the\npetitioners would not be entitled to the relief claimed. \nI have perused the judgment. As per this\njudgment, benefit of pre-mature increment can not be allowed in such\na situation when the person was on leave during strike. The relief\nclaimed would not be available to the petitioners in view of law laid\ndown in the case of Saroj Kumari (supra). The writ petition is,\naccordingly, dismissed. \nJuly 19, 2011\n(RANJIT SINGH)\nmonika\n JUDGE"
