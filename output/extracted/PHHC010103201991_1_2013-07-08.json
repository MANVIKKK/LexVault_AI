JUSTICE DR. BHARAT BHUSHAN \nPARSOON\n***\n.\n Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the\n judgment?\n. \nTo be referred to the Reporters or not?\n. Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?\n***\nPresent:\nShri Sumeet Sangwan,Advocate, for \nShri Harish Rathee, Advocate, for the petitioner.\nNone for the respondent.\n***\nDR.BHARAT BHUSHAN PARSOON, J\nIn this Civil Writ petition filed under Articles 226/227 of the\nConstitution of India, the petitioner has sought a writ in the nature of\nMandamus or any other writ or orders against the respondent-M.D.\nUniversity (hereinafter to be referred to as the  respondent-University ),\nto consider his case for promotion to the post of Assistant with effect from\nthe date, his juniors were promoted, along with other consequential\nbenefits. Direction was also sought against the respondent-University for\nplacing the petitioner at serial No. 261 above Shri Rajbir Singh, in the\nseniority list, taking into account the date of joining of the petitioner on\nCWP 1545 of 92\nthe post of Clerk on ad hoc basis.\nClaim of the petitioner is that the petitioner was appointed as\nClerk on adhoc basis on 25.3.1983 , vide letter (Annexure P-1). His\nservices were regularized on the said post vide order dated 10.11.1983\n( Annexure P-2). Taking the wrong date of appointment of the petitioner\nas a regular clerk i.e 28.11.1983, he was placed at serial No. 330 in the\nseniority list and for this reason he was not promoted as Assistant.\nFurther claim of the petitioner is that in fact he joined his duties on\n.3.1983 and thus he should have been placed at serial No. 261 in the\nseniority list. It is averred that the petitioner was wrongly not promoted as\nAssistant and even his representation (Annexure P-7) for assigning\nappropriate place in the seniority list, was not considered.\nIn addition, the petitioner has claimed that the respondent-\nUniversity violated its own service rules for non-teaching employees. It is\nalso claimed that the petitioner was treated differently though he was\nsimilarly situated with other employees, whose services rendered on\nadhoc basis were counted towards their probation period but the same\nbenefit was denied to the petitioner.\nThe stand of the respondent-University on the contrary is\nthat no right much less statutory, has been infringed. It has been\nexplained that the petitioner was initially appointed as a Clerk purely on\nadhoc basis and for a period of six months and that too subject to\ncompliance of certain conditions with effect from 26.3.1983 and had been\ngiven extension from time to time. One of the conditions contained in the\nletter of appointment was that the petitioner has to qualify the written test\nas well as typing test in English at a speed of 30 words per minute. \nCWP 1545 of 92\nOn his passing the written test, services of the petitioner\nwere regularized by the University with effect from 22.11.1983 but, he\nwas further required to pass the type test. Later on, when he could not\nqualify the type test, relaxing this condition, on expiry of two years of his\nprobation period, he was confirmed with effect from 28.11.1985. It is\nclaimed that service rendered by the petitioner on adhoc basis, thus ,\ncannot be counted towards his seniority. \nIt has also been explained that before preparing the final\nseniority list, in May 1988 objections were invited from the concerned\nofficials within 10 days of the issue of the circular, with clear stipulation\nthat in absence of any objections raised within the stipulated period, the\nseniority list will be treated as final and that since the petitioner had not\nraised any objection, it was finalized thereafter. Qua claim of the\npetitioner that other non-teaching employees promoted as Assistants\nwere given the benefits of adhoc service in counting their service period,\nit is clarified that they had been appointed on regular basis without any\nrider or conditions attached to their appointment, which was not the case\nof the petitioner, as he was required to qualify the written examination as\nalso the typing test. In short, the University had claimed that the\npetitioner had correctly been placed in the seniority list according to the\nRules of the University. Prayer for dismissal of the petition was made.\nSince, there is no representation on behalf of the\nrespondent-University in this petition and the matter is of 1992, instead of\nadjourning the case for the appearance of the counsel for respondent-\nUniversity, it is considered appropriate to dispose of the matter after\nhearing learned counsel for the petitioner.\nCWP 1545 of 92\nI have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and perused\nthe documents placed on the record.\nIn the seniority list issued by the respondent-University name\nof the petitioner is appearing at serial No. 330, taking the date as\n.11.1983 i.e the date of his regularization. No doubt, pursuant to his\nappointment on adhoc basis, the petitioner had joined his duties on\n.3.1983 but the said period of service rendered on adhoc basis was\nnot counted towards the period of regularization.\nThe reason is not far to seek. It is rather revealed that the\npetitioner was appointed on 25.3.1983 purely on adhoc basis for a\nperiod of six months on the post of a clerk and he joined on 26.03.1983\nand was required to qualify the prescribed written test as well as typing\ntest in English and further his services were liable to be terminated at any\ntime without any notice.\n Accepting these conditions contained in the appointment\nletter dated 25.3.1983, the petitioner joined his duties on 26.3.1983. Vide\nletter dated 10.11.1983, services of the petitioner were ordered to be\nregularized, subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions contained\ntherein which included  Verification of character and antecedents as also\nproduction of medical fitness Certification from a competent authority .\nOn the fulfillment of said conditions, services of the petitioner were\nregularized with effect from 22.11.1983 i.e the date on which the said\nconditions had been fulfilled by the petitioner.\nNotwithstanding regularization of services of the petitioner\nwith effect from 22,12,1983 (as per communication of 25.10.1984), the\npetitioner was required to pass the type test in English at the speed of 30\nCWP 1545 of 92\nwords per minutes before being considered for confirmation on\ncompletion of probation period of one year which was to be counted with\neffect from 22.11.1983. Despite the extension of period of probation, the\npetitioner had failed to qualify the requisite type test from time to time, till\nthe expiry of period of two years of probation and even thereafter.\nShowing benevolent mercy, the respondent-University\nrelaxed the condition of passing of typing test and after completion of\nthe extended period of probation of two years, the petitioner was\nconfirmed as a Clerk.\nFrom the factual matrix as discussed earlier, it is clear that\npassing of the typing test was a condition precedent for regularization.\nCoupled with character verification and antecedents as also production of\nmedical fitness certificate, without waiting for the passing of requisite\ntyping test, services of the petitioner were regularized vide letter dated\n.10.1984 (Annexure P-3). Since the petitioner was required to qualify\nthe typing test during the period of probation one year, on his failure to do\nso his services were to be terminated automatically on this ground. \nCondition No.3 of letter dated 25.10.1984 (Annexure P-3) is\nextracted as under:-\n You will, therefore, be on probation\nfor a period of one year in the first instance and\nthe probation will be counted with effect from\n.11.1983. You will, however, have to qualify the\ntype test in English at the speed of 30 words per\nminutes before you are considered for\nconfirmation on the completion of your\nprobationary period. In the event of your failure\nto qualify the type test, your services may stand\nterminated automatically on this ground .\nThe University instead of terminating services of the\nCWP 1545 of 92\npetitioner for his failure to qualify the typing test, provided him\nsustenance and support by relaxing the condition of passing of typing test\nbut the petitioner instead of showing his gratitude towards the University\nhas raised his accusing finger at the respondent and that too without any\nbasis.\nStand of the University that the seniority list was prepared on\nthe basis of date of joining of the concerned employees on regular post,\nand that too after considering the objections from the concerned officials,\ncould not be assailed by the learned counsel for the petitioner.\nThus, it is clear that adhering to the Service Rules, the\nUniversity had acted fairly and had rather relaxed the condition of\npassing of the typing test when the petitioner had not been able to qualify\nthe said test even during the extended period of probation of two years.\nIn fact this large hearted approach of the University had attributed\ntowards the retention of the petitioner in service otherwise in terms of\n(extracted earlier), the petitioner was to be off the job.\nAs far as counting of adhoc service rendered by the\npetitioner is concerned, when the petitioner had not been able to qualify\nthe requisite typing test (which was a condition precedent), he was\nneither eligible to be appointed as a clerk nor was to be retained in\nservice. The period of adhoc service of the petitioner could not be\ncounted towards the probation period. Stand of the petitioner that he has\nwrongly been placed at serial No. 330 in the seniority list, taking the date\nof his joining the post of clerk inter-alia on regular basis (i.e after\ncomplying with the other requisite conditions), is without any substance.\nWhen clerks other than the petitioner, were promoted as Assistants in\nCWP 1545 of 92\nterms of their seniority viz-a-viz from the date of joining regular service,\nthey cannot be considered juniors to the petitioner. \nLooking from another angle, the petitioner was regularized\non the post of a clerk vide letter dated 25.10.1984 with effect from\n.11.1983 ignoring the service rendered by him on adhoc basis and only\nafter counting the regular service rendered by the petitioner, he was\nconfirmed as a clerk with effect from 28.11.1985 vide communication\ndated 22.3.1986. He, however filed the present writ petition only on\n.1.1992. Thus, there is long delay in filing the petition revealing that\nthe petitioner had been in long slumber.\nConsequently, when the petitioner has not been able to show\nviolation of any Service Rules and when his appointment was on adhoc\nbasis, dehors the Rules and was subject to the condition of qualifying the\nwritten examination as also of passing of requisite type test in English,\nthe respondent University was right in excluding the period of adhoc\nservice for determination of the seniority. It was also so held in 2001(3)\nRSJ 15 (SC)- State of Punjab and others Vs. Gurdeep Kumar Uppal\nand others; 2000(4) RSJ 167 (SC)- State of Haryana Vs. Haryana\nVeterinary and A.H.T.S. Asson and another and Civil Appeal No.\nof 2012 (arising out of SLP   No. 29274 of 2009) State of\nHaryana and others Vs. Vijay Singh and others.\nAs a result of above discussion the writ petition is without\nany merit and is dismissed.\nJuly 8, 2013\n (DR.BHARAT BHUSHAN PARSOON)\nMalik \n JUDGE"
