  "judgment_text": "IN THE HIGH COURT OF PUNJAB AND HARYANA AT\nCHANDIGARH\nCriminal Revision No. 1057 of 1997\nDate of Decision : July, 02, 2010\nBalbir\n....Petitioner\nVersus\nState of Haryana \n.....Respondent\nCORAM : HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE T.P.S. MANN\nPresent :\nMr. Ishwar Lal, Advocate\nMr. Manish Deswal, Deputy Advocate General, Haryana\nT.P.S. MANN, J. (Oral)\nThe petitioner was tried for an offence under Section 379 of\nthe Indian Penal Code on the allegations that on 8.3.1991 at about 5.00\np.m. in the area of Bus Stand, Sadhaura, he committed theft of Rs.110/-\nby taking that amount out of the possession of complainant-Maha Singh.\nVide judgment and order dated 10/11.10.1995, Additional Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Jagadhri convicted him for the aforementioned offence and\nsentenced him to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and to\npay a fine of Rs.500/-. Aggrieved of his conviction and sentence, the\npetitioner filed an appeal but the same was dismissed by Additional\nSessions Judge, Yamuna Nagar on 3.11.1997. Consequently, he was\ntaken into custody so as to serve the sentence imposed upon him. He\nthen filed the present revision in which he was granted the concession of\nCrl. Revision No. 1057 of 1997\n -2-\nbail on 10.12.1997.\nLearned counsel for the petitioner has not challenged the\nconviction of the petitioner for the offence under Section 379 IPC.\nHowever, he has submitted that the occurrence in question had taken\nplace more than nineteen years earlier. The amount said to have been\nstolen by the petitioner was recovered from him when he was shown to\nhave been apprehended while running away from the spot. The\npetitioner is not a previous convict. He has already deposited the fine\nimposed upon him by the trial Court. Out of the sentence of one year,\nhe has served an actual period of one and a half months. Therefore, the\nsentence of imprisonment imposed upon the petitioner be reduced to\nthat already undergone by him.\nOn the other hand, learned State counsel has opposed the\nprayer made on behalf of the petitioner by submitting that the petitioner\nhad pushed the complainant while alighting from a bus at Bus Stand\nSadhaura and in the process took out Rs.110/- from the right pocket of\nthe pant worn by the complainant. He tried to run away from the spot\nbut was overpowered by the persons present there and the amount of\nRs.110/- was recovered from him. Therefore, he does not deserve any\nleniency in the matter of sentence.\nWhen the petitioner was heard by the trial Court on the\nquantum of sentence, he had stated that he had small children to support\nand was the only bread earner of the family. The petitioner has been\nCrl. Revision No. 1057 of 1997\n -3-\nfacing the agony of criminal prosecution since the month of March,\n. From the records, it is apparent that after being taken into\ncustody on 8.3.1991, the petitioner was released on bail on 9.3.1991.\nHe was again taken into custody on 3.11.1997 when his appeal against\nhis conviction and sentence was dismissed by the lower appellate Court.\nIt was only on 10.12.1997 that he was ordered to be released on bail.\nTaking into consideration the totality of the circumstances, the Court is\nof the view that no useful purpose would be served by sending the\npetitioner behind the bars, once again, for undergoing the remainder of\nhis sentence. Ends of justice would be amply met if the substantive\nsentence of the petitioner is reduced to that already undergone by him.\nResultantly, the conviction of the petitioner under Section\nIPC is upheld. His substantive sentence of imprisonment is reduced\nto that already undergone by him. \nExcept for the modification in the quantum of sentence of\nimprisonment to the extent as indicated above, the revision fails and is,\ntherefore, dismissed.\n( T.P.S. MANN )\nJuly 02, 2010\nJUDGE\najay-1"
