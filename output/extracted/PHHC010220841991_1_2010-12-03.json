A.G., Punjab;\nJASBIR SINGH, J. (oral)\nJUDGMENT\nThis judgment will dispose of three petitions , i.e., Civil Writ\nPetitions No. 12154 of 1991, 8898 of`1991 and 8811 of 1996. For facility\nof dictating judgment facts are being taken from CWP No. 12154 of 1991.\nIn this writ petition, challenge has been laid to a notification\nissued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, (in short the Act)\non March 11, 1977 proposing to acquire 3 Acres, 1 Kanal and 14 Marlas of\nland, for a public purpose, namely, construction of New Mandi Township at\nPathankot. Challenge has also been laid to a Notification issued under\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 12154 OF 1991\n-2-\nSection 6 of the Act on March 14, 1977. It is necessary to mention here that\nwhile issuing above said notifications, provisions of Section 17 of the Act\nwere also invoked. Challenge has also been laid to the Award passed on\nSeptember 23, 1986. \nIt is apparent from the records that the petitioners earlier also\nfiled a Civil Writ Petition No. 5726 of 1982 with a prayer to quash the\nnotifications issued under Sections 4 and 6. That writ petition was allowed\nin their favour vide order dated January 31, 1983 and the notifications in\nquestion were quashed. The respondent -State went to the Hon'ble Supreme\nCourt and in Civil Appeal No. 2334 of 1986, vide order dated March 6,\n, judgment, passed by the High Court, was quashed and the acquisition\nwas upheld. Concluding portion of the judgment, passed by the Supreme\nCourt, reads thus:\n That the judgment and order dated 31st January, 1983 of the\nHigh Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh in Civil Writ\nPetition No. 5726 of 1982 be and is hereby set aside and in\nplace thereof an order dismissing the above mentioned Writ\nPetition filed in the Punjab and Haryana High Court be and is\nhereby substituted;\n. That the parties herein shall bear their own costs of the said\nappeal in this Court.\n. That the order of this court dated 10th December, 1986 passed\nin the civil miscellaneous petition No. 14226 of 1983 in the\nsaid appeal directing the maintenance of status quo, be and is\nhereby vacated. Hence the Hon'ble Supreme Court has\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 12154 OF 1991\n-3-\nalready adjudicated the matter in view of the respondents.\nQuestion to release the land at this stage does not arise.  \nWhen the matter was pending before the Supreme Court, Award\nwas passed on September 23, 1986. The petitioners thereafter kept mum\nand filed this writ petition only in the year 1991 to lay challenge to the\nabove said notifications and the Award.\nIt is primary grievance of the petitioners that the Award was\npassed only with regard to land and nothing was provided therein so far as\nsuper-structures are concerned. Be that as it may, in view of the judgment\nof the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Mohanji and another v. State of U.P.\nAnd others, JT 1995 (8) S.C. 599, which was followed thereafter in the\ncase of State of Punjab and others v. Sharan Pal Singh and others, Civil\nAppeals Nos. 11850-53 of 1995, decided on December 14, 1995, impugned\nnotifications and the Award cannot be quashed. The petitioners, if\naggrieved for non-grant of compensation, for the superstructures could have\nfiled claim under Section 18 of the Act.\nFurther contention of counsel for the petitioners that by shifting\nthe proposed road to the adjoining area, the constructed house of the\npetitioners could have been saved is of no substance at this stage. This plea\nwas raised before the Supreme Court and was rejected while upholding the\nissuance of notifications. It is also contended by counsel for the petitioners\nthat on a representation made by them, the matter was reconsidered by the\ncompetent authority. A report was made by the O.S.D. , Revenue\nDepartment, on May 22, 2007, stating that the road could not be constructed\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 12154 OF 1991\n-4-\nat the spot on account of resistance caused by the petitioners and further that\nthe proposed alternative road, may be more suitable. At this stage, it is not\npossible for us to interfere in the acquisition, which had become final in the\nyear 1987. The area could not be used for the purpose for which it was\nacquired because firstly the acquisition proceedings were quashed by this\nCourt and thereafter the Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the acquisition in\nthe year 1987. The construction raised was in existence when the\nacquisition was upheld. It is not case of the petitioners that in the\nintervening period, they have raised the construction. The road could not be\nconstructed because of resistance shown by the petitioners. No case is made\nout for interference. This writ petition is dismissed.\nCWP No. 8898 of 1991:\nSo far as CWP No. 8898 of 1991 is concerned, in this case it is\nprimary grievance of the petitioners that Award and the Notifications, vide\nwhich the land was acquired, be quashed because no compensation was\nawarded for the super-structures when award was passed on April 11, 1991.\nFor the reasons given in the earlier part of this judgment, no\ncase is made out for interference in this case also. Dismissed.\nCWP No. 8811 of 1996:\nBy filing CWP No. 8811 of 1996, notification issued under\nSection 4 of the Act on June 7, 1993, and further notification issued under\nSection 6 of the Act on January 3, 1994, are under challenge. Further\nchallenge has been laid to an award passed on February 14, 1996. This\npetition was filed in the month of June, 1996. In view of ratio of the\njudgment in Star Wire(India) Ltd. v. State of Haryana, (1996) 11 SCC\nCIVIL WRIT PETITION NO. 12154 OF 1991\n-5-\n, this writ petition having been filed after passing of an award cannot be\nentertained. Furthermore, by the time this writ petition was filed, most of\nthe area was utilised for the purpose for which it was acquired. Dismissed.\n\n( JASBIR SINGH )\nJUDGE\n(AUGUSTINE GEORGE MASIH)\nJUDGE\nDecember 03 , 2010. \nDKC"
