No. 2197-M of 1998\nDate of decision: 3rd July, 2008\nJagdish Chand\n  Petitioner\nVersus \nState of Punjab \n  Respondent\nCORAM: \nHON'BLE MR. JUSTICE KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA\nPresent: \nMr. M.S.Kohli, Advocate for the petitioner. \nMr. Mehardeep Singh, Assistant Advocate General Punjab for\nthe State. \nKANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA, J. (ORAL)\nIn the present case, it has been submitted by learned counsel\nfor the State that report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted on 16th\nSeptember, 1998. \nI have heard learned counsel for the petitioner. Disputed\nquestions of fact are involved in the present case, which cannot be gone\ninto in proceedings under Section 482 Cr.P.C. At this stage, counsel for the\npetitioner submits that he may be allowed to withdraw the present petition\nto raise all arguments before the trial Court at the time of framing of\ncharge. Counsel for the petitioner is sanguine that even from the challan\nsubmitted, no offence is made out and he will be discharged. \nSince the present petition was filed in year 1998 and\nproceedings in the FIR emanated in year 1997, taking into consideration\nCRM No. 2197-M of 1998\nlong pendency of the case, it will be just and appropriate in case the\npersonal appearance of the accused before the trial Court is exempted.\nAccordingly, it is ordered that the personal appearance of the accused shall\nremain exempted before the trial Court, subject to his filing an undertaking\nthat he shall cause his appearance as and when required by the trial Court.\nHe shall also file an undertaking that the evidence, if any, recorded in his\nabsence but in the presence of his counsel, shall be binding upon him. The\ntrial Court may incorporate any other conditions in the undertaking to be\nsubmitted by the accused. \nWith these observations, present petition is disposed off. \n[KANWALJIT SINGH AHLUWALIA]\nJUDGE \nJuly 3, 2008\nrps"
