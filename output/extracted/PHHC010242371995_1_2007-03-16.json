No.19123 of 2005 and\nC.W.P.No.5312 of 1995\nDate of Decision:- 16.03.2007\nKishanchan Savlani & ors.\n....Petitioners\nthrough\nMr.M.L.Saggar, Advocate\nvs.\nThe Competent Authority & ors.\n....Respondent(s)\nthrough\n Mr.B.S.Baath, AAG, Punjab. \n***\nCORAM:-HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE SURYA KANT.\n***\n) Whether Reporters of the local papers may be allowed to see the\njudgment?\n) To be referred to the Reporters or not?\n) Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?\n***\nSURYA KANT, J.\nThis writ petition under Article 226/227 of the Constitution of\nIndia has been filed with a prayer to quash the orders dated December 31,\n(Annexure P-8), August 1, 1985 (Annexure P-10) passed by\nrespondent Nos.1 and 2 respectively, vide which the land measuring\n.60 square metres in possession of the petitioners situated in Rakh\nShikargarh Area on GT Road Bye-pass near junction of Fatehgarh Churian\nRoad, Amritsar, was declared surplus in purported exercise of the powers\nconferred under Section 10(1) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation)\nAct, 1976 (Central Act No.33 of 1976)\nNeedless to say that the impugned orders dated December 31,\n(Annexure P-8) and August 1, 1985 (Annexure P-10) were also\nC.M. No.19123 of 2005 and\n-2-\nC.W.P.No.5312 of 1995\npassed under the afore-stated 1976 Act only.\nVide order dated November 6, 1985 this writ petition was\nadmitted and was ordered to be heard along with Civil Writ Petition\nNo.2244 of 1985 but no stay was given to the petitioner qua the afore-\nmentioned land which was declared surplus with them. \nThe case was taken up for final hearing on July 14, 2004, when\nit was brought to the notice of the Court that the counsel for the petitioners\nhad died. The Registry was accordingly directed to send notices to the\npetitioners for September 29, 2004. In response thereto, the office reported\nthat petitioners No.1 & 2 (Kishanchand Savlani and Smt.Ratna Savlani)\nhave died.\nThereafter Civil.Misc.Nos.19122 and 19150 of 2005 were\nmoved for impleading the legal representatives of the deceased petitioners\nNo.1 and 2. The same were allowed vide order dated February 03, 2006 and\npetitioner No.3-being the sole legal heir of petitioner Nos.1 and 2, was\nordered to be impleaded as their legal representative.\nIt is fairly conceded by Shri B.S.Baath, learned Assistant\nAdvocate General, Punjab, that the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation)\nAct, 1976 has since been repealed vide the Central Ordinance No.5 of 1999\nwith effect from 22.3.1999 as has been notified by the Government of\nPunjab, Department of Housing and Urban Development vide their\nnotification No.7/1/99-3HGI-1899 dated 30.5.2000. As a result thereof, the\nproceedings under the 1976 Act have come to an end in the State of Punjab.\nIn their written reply dated 8.2.2007 filed on behalf of\nrespondent Nos.1 and 2, it is not disputed that notwithstanding the\ndeclaration of excess area under the repealed Act of 1976, the petitioners\nC.M. No.19123 of 2005 and\n-3-\nC.W.P.No.5312 of 1995\ncontinue to retain possession of the subject property.\nSince the Act has been repealed during the pendency of this\nwrit petition and the proceedings initiated thereunder have not yet attained\nfinality and the possession of the properties also remained with the\npetitioner, in my view, further proceedings under the afore-mentioned Act\nno longer survive and stand lapsed, particularly when no saving clause of\nany kind in the Repealing Act has been brought to the notice of this Court.\nAs a necessary consequence, the action which culminated into passing of\nthe impugned orders dated December 31, 1984 and August 1, 1985\n(Annexures P-8 and P-10) has also lost legal back-up rendering the same in-\noperative.\nShri M.L.Saggar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\npetitioner also accepts the legal and factual position that no cause of action\nsurvives in favour of the petitioner after repealing of the 1976 Act as the\norders passed thereunder having become inoperative.\nConsequently and in view of the stand taken by learned\nAssistant Advocate General, Punjab, as stated above, this writ petition has\nbeen rendered infructuous and is disposed of accordingly.\nNo costs.\nMarch 16, 2007\n( SURYA KANT )\npoonam\nJUDGE"
