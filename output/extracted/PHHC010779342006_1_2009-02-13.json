  "judgment_text": "In the High Court of Punjab & Haryana at Chandigarh\nR. F. A. No. 30 of 2006 (O&M)\nState of Haryana and another\n.... Appellants\nvs\nDarshan Singh and another\n..... Respondents\nCoram:\nHon'ble Mr. Justice Rajesh Bindal\nPresent: \nMr. Lokesh Sinhal, Additional Advocate General, Haryana. \nMr. Raman Gaur, Advocate, for HUDA.\nRajesh Bindal J.\nThrough the present appeal the State has approached this court for\nreduction in compensation for the acquisition of land. \nBriefly, the facts of the case are that the State of Haryana vide\nnotification dated 12.5.1995 issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act,\n(for short,  the Act ), acquired land forming part of Hadbast No. 38, in\nrevenue estate of Bahadurgarh, District Jhajjar, for development and utilisation as\nresidential and commercial area in Sector-9 and 9-A, Bahadurgarh. The Land\nAcquisition Collector assessed the market value of the land at Rs. 6 lacs per acre\nfor the land situated on Bahadurgarh-Delhi road upto the depth of 3 acres, Rs. 4\nlacs per acre for the land situated on Bahadurgarh-Najafgarh road upto the depth\nof 3 acres, Rs. 2.50 lacs per acre for nehri and chahi and Rs. 2 lacs per acre for\nbarani and other kinds of land. The landowners/claimants feeling dissatisfied with\nthe quantum of compensation awarded by the Collector, filed objections. On\nreference under Section 18 of the Act, the learned court below determined the\nmarket value of the acquired land by granting increase of Rs. 50,000/- per acre in\neach category. It is this award of the learned Reference Court which is impugned\nin the present appeal. \nLearned counsel for the State very fairly conceded that the issue\ninvolved in the present appeal is squarely covered by the judgment of this court in\nR. F. A. No. 1 of 2006 State of Haryana and another vs Jagbir Singh and others,\ndecided on 10.2.2009, whereby the compensation payable to the landowners has\nbeen further enhanced. \nSince this court has further enhanced the compensation payable to\nthe landowners, the present appeal for reduction in compensation does not survive.\nAccordingly, for the reasons recorded in Jagbir Singh's case, the present appeal is\ndismissed. \n.2.2009\n ( Rajesh Bindal)\nvs.\n\n Judge"
