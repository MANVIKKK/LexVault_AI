State of Punjab \nCORAM:\nHon'ble Mr. Justice Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia.\nPresent:\nMr.Nitin Kumar, Advocate, for the petitioner.\nMr. Mehardeep Singh, AAG, Punjab.\nK.S. Ahluwalia, J. (Oral)\nThe instant criminal revision has been filed by Kesar\nSingh son of Hari Singh, resident of Kartar Pur, District Ropar.\nThe prosecution case is that on 9-5-1993 at about 11-00\na.m. in the area of bus stand Katani Kalan, the petitioner was driving\nBus No. CH-01G-5061 and due to his rash and negligent driving,\nwhile attempting to overtake a tempo, it ran over the same and hit an\nelectric pole and thereafter ran over one Maghi Ram, who was\nstanding on left side of the road, as a result of which the latter died. \nThe petitioner was convicted by the Judicial Magistrate\nst Class, Ludhiana and sentenced to RI for one year under Section\n-A IPC and a fine of Rs. 2,000/- and six months' RI under Section\nIPC. It was further ordered that non-payment of fine will entail\nhim with three months' RI. All the sentences were ordered to run\nconcurrently. \nThe petitioner filed appeal, which was also dismissed by\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge, Ludhiana. Hence he has come\nup in the present revision petition. \nSh. Nitin Kumar appearing for the petitioner has very fairly\nstated that since the witnesses have been believed by both the\nCourts below and they have returned the findings of fact, it would be\ndifficult for him to dislodge the testimony of the witnesses before a\nrevisional court.\nCriminal Revision No. 407 of 1998 (2)\nMaking an alternative prayer for reduction of sentence,\nMr. Nitin Kumar submits that the occurrence took place in May 1993.\nA period of 15 years has elapsed. The petitioner has suffered a\nprotracted trial. He was taken into custody on 18-4-1998 and was\nenlarged on bail on 20-5-1998 i.e. he has undergone one month and\ntwo days. \nTaking into consideration the totality of circumstances, I\nfind no justification in sending the petitioner behind bars once again\nafter 15 years. The sentence awarded by the trial Court is reduced\nto the period already undergone by the petitioner, subject to payment\nof fine of Rs.25,000/-, which ( if realised) shall be disbursed to the\nlegal heirs of deceased Maghi Ram. The amount of fine shall be\ndeposited before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ludhiana within three\nmonths from today. \nIn case of failure to deposit the amount of fine, the\npresent revision shall be deemed to have been dismissed and the\npetitioner shall undergo the remnant sentence, as awarded by the\ntrial Court. \nWith the aforesaid modification in the sentence, the\nrevision petition stands disposed of. \n\n[Kanwaljit Singh Ahluwalia]\n\n Judge \nJanuary 23, 2008. \n `ask'"
