Whether reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment ? No . To be referred to the reporters or not? No . Whether the judgment should be reported in the digest?No K. Kannan, J (oral). . By an order dated 1.8.1991 when the above review application in the writ petition filed in the year 1987 came up for hearing this Court had observed that the issue for review will be taken up subsequent to the decision in CWP No. 8486 of 1990. The said writ petition has been disposed of on 13.1.1994 where the Court has held that Corporation was bound to make allotment of industrial plots to the petitioners as per the terms and conditions mentioned in the letters of allotment. The Bench has also given the liberty to the Corporation to claim additional price in the plot on account of enhancement of compensation under the Land Acquisition Act. The review is sought on the basis that he was not a party to the writ petition. The cancellation of allotment of plots had a direct bearing to his own right, he being an allottee. The petitioner cannot any longer be aggrieved since through the decision of CWP No. of 1987 the Court has held that the cancellation of allotment would be ineffective and has directed the allotment. . The review application is disposed of as unnecessary in view of the judgment quashing the order of cancellation of allotment in CWP No. 8486 of 1990. The petitioner is present in Court and states that he is not aware of even cancellation of allotments. Any right which the petitioner has will follow the directions given by this Court already in CWP No. 3310 of 1990. (K. KANNAN) JUDGE April 21 , 2011 archana",
